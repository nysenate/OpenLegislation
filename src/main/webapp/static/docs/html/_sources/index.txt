**Open Legislation v2.0 API Docs**
==================================

What is this?
-------------

`Open Legislation`_ is a web service that delivers legislative information from the New York State Senate and Assembly
to the public in near-real time. It is used to serve legislative data for `nysenate.gov`_ and other various services.

Legislative data is sent via the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission (LBDC) in a raw file format. The data is
ingested and cleaned up internally by Open Leg and made available for consumption through a REST API.

This documentation explains how to utilize the REST API to retrieve bills, resolutions, laws, committee agendas, and more.
You will need to sign up for a free API key from the Open Legislation homepage in order to use this service.

The code is open source and available on `Github`_.

Terminology
-----------

First let's define some common legislative terminology

:Session Year:
    A legislative session year in New York State comprises of two years, with the first year being an odd numbered year.

:Bill:
    A bill is passed with the intention of amending or creating a specific portion of NYS Law.

:Resolution:
    A resolution does not necessarily impact law and are often introduced to provide honorable mentions.

:Calendar:
    A legislative calendar is a snapshot of the status of bills that are under discussion at a particular time.
    A calendar will typically contain a floor calendar and an active list, along with supplemental floor calendars and active lists.

:Floor Calendar:
    The floor calendar is a listing of all bills that are under discussion (on the floor).  A bill must be read on the
    senate floor a minimum of three times to be eligible for a vote, and the floor calendar will indicate the number of
    readings for each bill at its time of publication.

:Active List:
    An active list is a listing of bills that are scheduled for discussion during a single senate session.

:Committee:
    Committees are groups of senators that are focused on particular areas of law.  Bills must be approved by a committee
    in order to be reported to the senate floor.

:Uni-Bill:
    A uni bill is a bill that is sent through both chambers concurrently
