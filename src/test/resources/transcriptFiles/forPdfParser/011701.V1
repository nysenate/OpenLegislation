                             I think the reason that there is

                 some discussion this year is that after this

                 bill has been around for about three or four

                 years, for some -- well, the memo by the Trial

                 Lawyers, they have never, to my knowledge,

                 ever memoed against it before.  But I guess

                 someone must have said to them, "You know,

                 this could create a problem."

                             What this does is, and the

                 committee members in the past have agreed

                 that -- and this time, that this really is a

                 potential for some savings and for some

                 facilitating the system.  It permits a party

                 to a lawsuit to agree to conduct depositions

                 by telephone or other remote electronic means.

                             I think we all have -- those of us

                 that have been lawyers realize that there's





                                                          105



                 some occasions, and it'd probably be rare

                 occasions, where it would be wise to allow the

                 taking of certain depositions and getting

                 certain information by electronic means,

                 especially in the age we're in.

                             I don't think it would be used a

                 great deal.  The problem with the argument, I

                 think, by the Trial Lawyers is it assumes

                 somehow that the judge is arbitrarily going to

                 make a decision in some high-profile case or

                 something of that nature.  I'm not sure that

                 that might in fact be a reason to potentially

                 overturn the case, I guess, depending on how

                 serious the issue was.

                             But I think that -- this bill, as I

                 say, passed the Senate last year by 56 to 2;

                 it passed the Senate I think almost

                 unanimously the year before.  I think that

                 very possibly there's just some nervousness

                 because someone must have pointed out, you

                 know, someone could say that maybe this is

                 going to create -- would create less court

                 time.  And that's true.  And maybe that's

                 something that we should really look to.

                             So I just think this is a logical





                                                          106



                 bill.  This is a bill that I believe initially

                 came from the OCA, if I'm not mistaken.  The

                 reason I say that is we have a number of bills

                 now that we move every year because we know

                 that the OCA is coming in later and if we wait

                 for the OCA or these other groups to come in,

                 we won't get them done until too late.

                             So I believe, and I'm 99 percent

                 sure, that this is one of those bills.  I know

                 it's been around for quite a few years.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 Dollinger.

                             SENATOR DOLLINGER:    Thank you,

                 Mr. President.  Would the sponsor yield for a

                 question?

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 Volker, do you yield for a question?

                             SENATOR VOLKER:    I would.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    The

                 sponsor yields.

                             SENATOR DOLLINGER:    I'm one of

                 those, Senator Volker, who has voted for this

                 bill in the past.  And I'm looking at it with

                 a new set of eyes this year.

                             My question is, what standards are





                                                          107



                 applied by the judge to determine upon

                 application whether a deposition by telephonic

                 means is appropriate?

                             SENATOR VOLKER:    Well, you know

                 that -- I think you are well aware that the

                 standards that would be used are the normal

                 standards where parties to a lawsuit are

                 involved.  Certainly the lack of -- as my

                 counsel points out to me, the lack of

                 prejudice and the normal arguments could be

                 made.

                             I think that -- I suppose we could

                 assume that some judge would be arbitrary.

                 But as you and I know, in civil cases if that

                 occurred, as I say, it would be under special

                 circumstances.  I suppose it would be one of

                 the issues that could be involved for

                 potentially an appeal.

                             I think that the reason, as I say,

                 that -- the very reason that we want to speed

                 up the process may be the reason why there's

                 some objection here.  And it just seems to me

                 it's a logical kind of component to the system

                 to allow this to occur.  I know all the other

                 stuff on billable hours and all that sort of





                                                          108



                 thing, but I just think it makes sense.

                             SENATOR DOLLINGER:    Thank you,

                 Mr. President.  Just briefly, on the bill.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 Dollinger, on the bill.

                             SENATOR DOLLINGER:    I don't

                 dispute Senator Volker's characterization that

                 this bill in many instances may make sense.  I

                 think it may also significantly reduce the

                 cost of litigation and the cost of

                 depositions.

                             But apart from what the Trial

                 Lawyers say -- and I haven't even read their

                 memo -- it seems to me that what we should

                 have is some standard for allowing the

                 telephonic recording of depositions.

                             I think our experience, Senator

                 Volker, with videotaped depositions and other

                 forms of electronic depositions proves that

                 they are reliable, that they meet the test.

                 But the question is this bill does not really

                 say the circumstances under which, if there

                 were an application filed for a telephonic

                 deposition and the opposing party, plaintiff

                 or defendant, said, "We don't want to do it





                                                          109



                 that way, we want to in essence require the

                 live deposition and that the person to be

                 deposed actually come to New York and be

                 deposed there," there's no real standard for

                 the court to decide the instances in which

                 compelling circumstances, financial

                 circumstances, scheduling difficulties -- all

                 the reasons which would be appropriate, I

                 think, to require telephonic depositions in

                 some cases -- they aren't really contained in

                 the bill.

                             So this bill says to the courts of

                 this state upon an application and upon an

                 opposing affidavit from a party -- it doesn't

                 really give the court any guidance to

                 determine the circumstances under which

                 telephonic recording or telephonic depositions

                 would be possible.

                             I would suggest if we're going to

                 do this, we ought to do it with standards that

                 give the judiciary guidance in deciding the

                 appropriate instances in which a telephonic

                 deposition would be permissible.

                             I know that there are trial

                 lawyers, and I'm one of them, who believe that





                                                          110



                 not only the dynamics of litigation sometimes

                 require that you bring other parties to

                 New York, to force them to bear the cost of

                 coming to New York, which is consistent with

                 our "long arm statute" and our belief that

                 people should come here to litigate if they

                 want to do business here.

                             But the other thing is, quite

                 frankly, that you really give up something in

                 a telephonic deposition, or you can give up

                 something, because you lose the ability to

                 perceive the reactions of people who are in

                 the room with you when you ask them questions.

                             So I would rather have a bill --

                 although this talks about the protocol for how

                 to do it, it doesn't really provide guidance

                 to our courts on instances in which it would

                 be appropriate.  And in the absence of that,

                 it just gives too much flexibility to the

                 courts and doesn't really contain a clear,

                 coherent message of what we want the courts to

                 do in specific cases in which telephonic

                 depositions might be appropriate.

                             I'll vote in the negative, Mr.

                 President.





                                                          111



                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 Volker.

                             SENATOR VOLKER:    Mr. President, I

                 just want to point out two things.

                             One, that the Chief Judge of the

                 Court of Appeals, Judith Kaye, just gave her

                 State of the Judiciary address and talked

                 about bringing New York courts from the 18th

                 century into the 21st century.  And she talked

                 about all the new things that have occurred

                 and the fact that we really have not brought

                 our court system up-to-date.  I think this is

                 one of those types of things.

                             Let me point out to you, Senator

                 Dollinger, the problem with putting standards

                 in the bill, if you put all the so-called

                 reasonable standards that are normally equated

                 with this sort of situation, you will actually

                 be limiting the scope of the judge in many

                 cases.

                             It could be argued that you could

                 be limiting, because those standards, whatever

                 you put in the bill, then would become the --

                 sort of the absolute standard.  I think -- I

                 don't think that that probably is a good idea.





                                                          112



                             I think that this would be operated

                 on a very, very limited basis, because most

                 judges clearly would operate in the normal

                 processes.  And it just seems to me that it's

                 a logical extension of the kinds of things

                 that we're trying to do to speed up the

                 process in our courts.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Read the

                 last section.

                             THE SECRETARY:    Section 2.  This

                 act shall take effect on the first day of

                 January.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Call the

                 roll.

                             (The Secretary called the roll.)

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 DeFrancisco, to explain his vote.

                             SENATOR DeFRANCISCO:    I just want

                 to mention that my "no" vote is not that I

                 don't want to go into the 21st century,

                 because there are a lot of devices that are

                 helpful to cut costs.

                             The problem is that when you do a

                 deposition and you've never laid eyes on an

                 individual before, what the person says is





                                                          113



                 maybe as important as to how the person says

                 it.  And a litigator has to be able to

                 determine or make a judgment about

                 credibility -- not only to try the case, if

                 necessary, but also to determine whether or

                 not to try to settle it in view of the manner

                 as well as what the person says.

                             So I think it's -- if the attorneys

                 want to stipulate to this type of method, both

                 have made a reasoned judgement on behalf of

                 their client.  But to court-order this

                 procedure when you lose so much I think is not

                 a good idea.

                             ACTING PRESIDENT MEIER:    Senator

                 DeFrancisco will be recorded in the negative.

                             Announce the results.
