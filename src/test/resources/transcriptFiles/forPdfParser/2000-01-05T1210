                             THE PRESIDENT:    The Senate will

                 come to order.

                             I ask everyone present to please

                 rise and repeat with me the Pledge of

                 Allegiance.

                             (Whereupon, the assemblage recited

                 the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.)

                             THE PRESIDENT:    The invocation

                 today will be given by the Right Reverend

                 Daniel W. Herzog, Bishop of the Episcopal

                 Diocese of Albany, New York.

                             BISHOP HERZOG:    Eternal Father,

                 You entrust order and freedom and mercy to us.

                 We ask for Your grace not to pervert this

                 trust, but to regard the poor equal to the

                 powerful and to decide according to Your will

                 rather than some selfish way.  So that at the

                 end, when we shall surely stand before You and

                 see the eyes of those we ruled, our

                 consciences may not be afraid.

                             To this end, protect these Senators

                 and their households and their staffs from all

                 evil, preserve them in all goodness, and bring

                 them to everlasting life.  Amen.

                 President, I would appreciate the privilege of

                 appearing before your honorable bodies in

                 joint session on January 5, 2000, at 1 p.m.,

                 or as soon thereafter as may be convenient, to

                 personally deliver my annual message to the

                 Legislature.

                             "Sincerely, George E. Pataki."

                             THE PRESIDENT:    To be filed in

                 the Journal.

                             Senator Bruno.

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    Thank you, Madam

                 President.

                             Madam President, I'd like to open

                 and wish you and my colleagues in the Senate

                 and everyone in the chamber a very happy new

                 year.

                             We are in a new millennium.  We are

                 in a new century.  We are in a new year, the

                 year of 2000.  And we open today the 223rd

                 session of this Legislature.  That's even

                 before Senator Marchi's time.





                                                           8



                             (Laughter.)

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    And it seems that

                 we hardly left.  It seems that I have a vision

                 of being here just last week.

                             And we concluded last year's

                 session a few minutes ago.  And we in this

                 chamber can be very proud of what we did last

                 year, including last week's Health Care Reform

                 Act dealing with HCRA, Medicaid, Family Health

                 Plus, including the budget that we did with

                 the substantial tax cuts for the people of

                 this state, increased amounts for education,

                 higher and secondary, and so many other good

                 things.

                             And we can look forward in the year

                 2000, now, to this session, to building on our

                 successes of last year and the previous years.

                 And we can be proud of our successes, as we

                 can be proud of Governor George Pataki and the

                 leadership that he has provided over the last

                 five years for us and the people of this

                 state.  And we're proud that we have been able

                 to partner with him.

                             And I'm also very, very pleased

                 that we could partner with the Speaker in the





                                                           9



                 Assembly, the Republican leader, John Faso,

                 all of the Assembly people, in doing some of

                 the most meaningful things on behalf of our

                 constituency in this state.

                             And the dialogue that we have and

                 the discussions that we have with our

                 colleagues on this side of the aisle -- and I

                 know I speak for the Republican Conference to

                 the Democratic Conference when I say that most

                 of the time we enjoy the dialogue and the

                 discussion.  Occasionally you go on too long,

                 but we understand that.  But you have a lot to

                 say and feel that you have a lot to do.  And

                 we respect that, and I mean that.

                             And you're ably led by Senator

                 Connor, your leader, who represents your

                 interests as well as they can possibly be

                 represented.  And we respect that.  And we get

                 by whatever differences that we have.

                             And we have done some of the most

                 meaningful things together for the people of

                 this state.  If you look back over the

                 decades, we can be proud of what we have done.

                 And we do it together, with the Governor, with

                 our colleagues on both sides of the aisle,





                                                           10



                 with the Assembly, with the staff, with all

                 the input that we get.

                             We're going forward, and we are

                 going to continue that dialogue, we're going

                 to continue that relationship.  And we are

                 recognizing that we are providing for the

                 people of this state not just increased health

                 care benefits, greater access to health care,

                 money for education and continuing education,

                 increased tax cuts -- you name it.  Roads,

                 bridges, mass transit.  Why?  Because the

                 people of this state support us.  They support

                 us in government, and they support us because

                 they depend on us to help them meet their

                 needs.

                             And we all can be proud of how we

                 have helped the people of this state meet

                 their needs.  And we can look forward together

                 to continuing the economic prosperity, the

                 revitalization of New York State, and be proud

                 in the year 2000 that we are all part of the

                 Empire State.

                             Thank you, Madam President.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    Thank you,

                 Senator.

                 President.

                             Here we are starting a new session

                 in the final year of the last century, to be

                 accurate.  Or the present century, I suppose.

                 But everyone says we're starting a new

                 century, so what the heck.

                             I would add to -- I appreciate that

                 Bishop Herzog prayed for all the Senators, for

                 all of us to be safe from all people.  I also

                 pray that all people be safe from the Senate

                 and the Assembly of the State of New York.

                 Certainly in past history, upon reflection, we

                 haven't always legislated -- and of course,

                 hindsight is perfect, but it proves to be

                 later on perhaps we didn't always pass the

                 wisest legislation or the wisest budgets.

                             Although I do think we're making

                 progress.  If imitation is the best form of

                 flattery, then we Senate Democrats are

                 delighted to accept the compliments from the

                 Governor, who's adopted Senator Dollinger's

                 plan to repeal the gross receipts tax,

                 starting with manufacturing, a proposal he





                                                           12



                 brought to the floor for the last four years,

                 which the Majority voted down.  I hope you

                 have a change of heart now that the Governor

                 is proposing it.

                             We absolutely are delighted with

                 the compliments we received from Senator

                 Bruno, who has adopted Senator Gentile's EPIC

                 eligibility plan, which Senator Gentile's held

                 hearings on, on expanding the eligibility.

                 We're delighted to see that.

                             And of course we're delighted that

                 the Assembly is now -- the Assembly Majority

                 now is going ahead to set up a task force on

                 air fares in New York State, something that

                 members of this Senate Minority have done a

                 lot of work on -- former Senator Abate started

                 with it, others have picked it up -- because

                 it really is important to the upstate economy,

                 which needs a lot of help.

                             And hopefully, working with people

                 on both sides of the aisle in both houses,

                 this year we will be able to address what has

                 remained for many, many New Yorkers who aren't

                 in the metropolitan area some rather strained

                 economic times and a lack of economic





                                                           13



                 opportunity, even while the other half of the

                 state -- it's a tale of two cities, if you

                 will -- the other half of the state has had a

                 booming economy.  Although I haven't checked

                 to see what the market's doing today;

                 yesterday wasn't so good.

                             The Senate Minority have our

                 priorities for the year 2000.  They're not new

                 issues.  They're things you've heard from us

                 before, about things you will hear again from

                 the Minority about, things you will have an

                 opportunity to voice your opinion on when you

                 vote on amendments and motions to discharge.

                             We must deal with the problem of

                 guns.  We must ban semiautomatic weapons.  We

                 have to adopt a series of get-tough measures

                 on people who misuse guns.

                             Health care reform, we did so, so

                 much in that bill last week, but we still have

                 the problem of HMOs.  We have not afforded the

                 kind of protection our citizens want from the

                 bean-counter mentality that many HMOs impose

                 upon people from, in effect, medical care

                 decisions being made by nonprofessionals in

                 order to save money rather than to serve the





                                                           14



                 best interests of the patients.  We intend to

                 make that a priority.

                             Hate crimes is something that's out

                 there.  I hope -- I hope -- there are no new

                 incidents or tragedies for us to point out to

                 you during the course of this session.

                 Because there have been far too many past

                 ones.  And we have all -- we certainly have

                 all the examples of why we need strong

                 antibias violence legislation already.  I hope

                 there are no new ones.  I fear there will be

                 unless we take action on the antibias violence

                 bill.

                             And of course, education remains

                 our number-one priority.  For the future of

                 this state, we have to fund education

                 adequately and we have to be innovative and

                 creative about where those dollars go.

                             So, Madam President, I look forward

                 to working with Senator Bruno and the members

                 of the Majority.  I know I speak for my

                 colleagues on this side of the aisle when I

                 say that.  I think it's going to be a

                 productive year, a busy year.  And I think

                 it's an election year too, and that may have





                                                           15



                 some effect on proceedings as we go on.

                             Thank you, Madam President.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    Thank you,

                 Senator Connor.

                             Motions and resolutions.

                             Senator Bruno.

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    Madam President,

                 the last word is not necessarily the best.

                             (Laughter.)

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    I hereby give

                 written notice, according to Senate Rule 11,

                 that I will move to amend the rules in

                 relationship to the standards of conduct in

                 the Senate.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    Notice will be

                 filed in the Journal.

                             Senator Connor.

                             SENATOR CONNOR:    Madam President,

                 not having seen what rule Senator Bruno may be

                 offering, I similarly give notice of my

                 intention to move to alter the Senate rules on

                 January 10th, to amend the rules to add

                 provisions relating to the enactment of

                 ethical standards for members, officers, and

                 employees of the New York State Senate.





                                                           16



                             And may I add, I trust -- I trust

                 that by next week perhaps we won't need to

                 have two competing motions, but perhaps one.

                 We'll talk about that.

                             Thank you, Madam President.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    Notice will be

                 filed in the Journal.

                             Senator Bruno.

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    Madam President,

                 I offer up the following resolution, ask that

                 it be read in its entirety, and move for its

                 immediate adoption.

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    Madam President,

                 if we could stand at ease for just a few

                 moments.  We are awaiting a message from the

                 Assembly that they are organized, and they are

                 not as prepared, apparently, as we are.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    The Senate stands

                 at ease.

                             (Whereupon, the Senate stood at





                                                           20



                 ease at 12:27 p.m.)

                             (Whereupon, the Senate reconvened

                 at 12:36 p.m.)

                             THE PRESIDENT:    The Senate will

                 come to order.

                             ASSEMBLYMAN FARRELL:    Madam

                 President, I've been sent here by the Assembly

                 to -

                             THE PRESIDENT:    The Senate Chair

                 recognizes Assemblymen Flanagan and Farrell.

                             ASSEMBLYMAN FARRELL:    Thank you,

                 Madam President.

                             I have been sent here by the -- we

                 have been sent here by the Assembly to

                 announce that we have organized and we are

                 preparing and waiting upon you and the

                 Governor so he may deliver his State of the

                 State speech.

                             Thank you.

                             THE PRESIDENT:    Thank you.

                             Senator Bruno.

                             SENATOR BRUNO:    I thank the ably

                 capable Assemblymen for their welcome message.

                             And I would now recommend that we

                 in the Senate join our colleagues in the





                                                           21



                 Assembly to receive the Governor's 223rd State

                 of the State message.

                             And there being no further business

                 to come before the Senate, I would move that

                 we stand adjourned until January 10th, 3 p.m.,
