 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   So I'm

 2   Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, chair of the

 3   Assembly Ways and Means Committee, and today

 4   we have the fourth hearing in a series of

 5   hearings conducted by the joint fiscal

 6   committees of the Legislature regarding the

 7   Governor's proposed budget for fiscal year

 8   2020-2021.

 9         The hearings are conducted pursuant to

10   the New York State Constitution and the

11   Legislative Law.

12         And so today the Assembly Ways and

13   Means Committee and the Senate Finance

14   Committee will hear testimony concerning the

15   Governor's budget proposal for human

16   services.

17         So just couple of ground rules.     For

18   the -- well, let me introduce the members

19   first that are here in my conference, and

20   then Senator Krueger will introduce --

21   Senator Krueger, chair of the Senate Finance

22   Committee, will introduce the members from

23   her conference from the Senate.

24         So we have with us the chair of our
                                                      7

 1   Children and Families Committee, Ellen

 2   Jaffee; the chair of our Aging Committee,

 3   Harry Bronson; a member of the Children and

 4   Families Committee, Assemblyman Al Taylor.

 5         Liz, would you like to introduce

 6   your --

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Sure.   Actually

 8   I'm joined by the sitting-in ranker for

 9   Finance for the Senate Republicans, the

10   acting, Senator Gallivan.    Senator Seward

11   couldn't be with us today.

12         Then I am joined by the chair of

13   Social Services, Velmanette Montgomery; the

14   chair of -- I did it backwards?    I did it

15   backwards, excuse me.   The chair of Children

16   and Families, Senator Velmanette Montgomery.

17   The chair of Social Services, Senator Roxanne

18   Persaud.   The chair of Aging, Senator Rachel

19   May from Syracuse.   Senator John Brooks,

20   chair of Veterans.   Senator Diane Savino.

21   And I am Senator Liz Krueger.   Thank you.

22         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We also are

23   joined by Assemblyman Hevesi, chair of our

24   Social Services Committee.
                                                      8

 1         And Assemblyman Ra, our ranking

 2   member, will introduce the members of his

 3   conference who are here with us.

 4         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Thank you.

 5         Joining us this morning is Assemblyman

 6   Jake Ashby and Assemblyman Mark Walczyk.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 8         So now a few ground rules for

 9   everybody.   Keep an eye on the time clocks.

10   It's been helping us get through our hearings

11   with having time for the witnesses to present

12   testimony, for the legislators to be able to

13   ask questions.   The clock time is both for --

14   other than for the people testifying, but for

15   the members.   Just be mindful, the clock is

16   both for your questions and answers.

17         And we try and keep a pretty tight

18   ship because there are many nongovernmental

19   witnesses who are joining us today, as they

20   have other days, and we want to make sure

21   that the last person on the list gets an

22   opportunity to speak to the members.

23         So -- and just for the members, the

24   chair of the relevant committee has
                                                     9

 1   10 minutes to ask her questions and get

 2   answers; the other members, five minutes.

 3   The chairs are the only ones -- the relevant

 4   chair can have a second round of five

 5   minutes.   And when we go to nongovernmental

 6   witnesses, the nongovernmental witnesses will

 7   have up to five minutes to present their

 8   testimony, and members will have three

 9   minutes to ask a question.

10         We also, before we get started, we're

11   joined by Assemblyman Vanel.

12         And with that, I think we are ready,

13   Commissioner, to begin.   So we begin with

14   Sheila Poole, commissioner, New York State

15   Office of Children and Family Services.

16         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Thank you.

17   Good morning, Chairs Krueger and Weinstein,

18   Children and Families Committee Chairs

19   Montgomery and Jaffee, and distinguished

20   members of the Senate and Assembly.   My name

21   is Sheila Poole, and I am the commissioner of

22   the New York State Office of Children and

23   Family Services, and I am pleased to have

24   this opportunity to discuss this year's
                                                     10

 1   proposed budget for OCFS.

 2         This year's Executive Budget maintains

 3   OCFS funding just above last year's levels to

 4   support our core child welfare, childcare,

 5   and juvenile justice programs, while

 6   investing in new initiatives to better serve

 7   New York's children and families.

 8         As you know, on October 1st of 2019

 9   New York reached an historic milestone when

10   Raise the Age took full effect.   In keeping

11   with Governor Cuomo's pledge to fully fund

12   Raise the Age for eligible counties, the

13   Executive Budget adds $50 million to support

14   Raise the Age implementation, for a total of

15   $250 million in the coming fiscal year.

16         The Executive Budget expands the

17   Empire State Child Tax Credit to provide $157

18   million in relief to 400,000 families who

19   have children under the age of 4 and who earn

20   up to $50,000 a year.

21         Having adequate access to childcare

22   remains a national policy and fiscal issue as

23   well as one here in New York State.    The

24   Governor's Childcare Availability Task Force
                                                      11

 1   is continuing its important work and will

 2   issue its final report in December.

 3         In the meantime, the proposed

 4   Executive Budget maintains its commitment of

 5   nearly $832 million for childcare

 6   subsidies -- the highest level of investment

 7   in state history, serving more than 100,000

 8   low-income families and 170,000 children.

 9         We're also pleased to share that

10   New York State has awarded an additional $20

11   million in federal funding to expand

12   subsidized childcare statewide by an

13   additional 2500 childcare slots.

14         In addition, OCFS anticipates

15   additional funding this year through the

16   federal Childcare Development Fund.    And the

17   New York State Council of Children and

18   Families, which OCFS hosts, has also been

19   awarded federal funds in the amount of

20   $40 million through the Preschool Development

21   Birth through Five Grant, which will

22   strengthen our early childhood care and

23   education system.

24         Governor Cuomo mandated the Regional
                                                     12

 1   Economic Development Councils to consider

 2   childcare in their proposals, and they

 3   answered.   During Round 9, nearly

 4   $8.8 million was awarded to 16 childcare

 5   projects, and an additional $7.3 million was

 6   awarded to four projects that have a

 7   childcare component.   Every region has

 8   responded with proposals specific to their

 9   area, and we're looking forwarded to seeing

10   these public/private ideas come to fruition.

11          But still, we recognize there is more

12   to be done to make quality, affordable

13   childcare accessible to all families who need

14   it, and we will continue our work toward that

15   end.

16          The Governor's proposal again expands

17   access to quality after-school programming by

18   adding $10 million for a fourth round of

19   Empire State After-School Program grants.

20   This will create 6250 new after-school slots

21   for students in high-need districts, and will

22   bring our total expenditures for after-school

23   programs to $134 million and serving

24   80,000 students.
                                                     13

 1         When combined with funding for

 2   prekindergarten programs and child-focused

 3   tax credits, the state's overall support for

 4   families with young children has increased by

 5   more than $500 million since 2011.

 6         As cochair of the Governor's Domestic

 7   Violence Task Force, I'm pleased to report

 8   that the Executive Budget includes ambitious

 9   proposals to address the growing problem of

10   domestic violence.   As urged by the task

11   force, the budget adds $5 million in new

12   funding for a pilot program to expand

13   innovative models and provide a greater

14   flexibility in meeting the needs of families

15   affected by domestic violence.

16         The number of children entering foster

17   care continues its downward trajectory.

18   However, we know that far too many children

19   from minority families end up involved with

20   the child welfare system as a result of

21   implicit bias, despite the best intentions of

22   our dedicated child welfare workforce.

23         This year we will take the bold step

24   of requiring every county in the state to
                                                      14

 1   follow a blind removal process when

 2   considering to remove a child from their

 3   home.   It is time to adopt blind removals and

 4   take a significant step forward in ensuring

 5   social justice for all children and families.

 6           And last year, with your support,

 7   New York began implementing the federal

 8   Family First Prevention Services Act, with a

 9   Family First Transition Fund to help local

10   social service districts support, recruit and

11   retain foster families, including kinship

12   caregivers.   The Executive Budget continues

13   $3 million in funding for the state-supported

14   transition fund.

15           It also provides authorization to

16   spend up to $75 million in new one-time

17   federal funds that we've recently received

18   through our aggressive lobbying efforts in

19   Washington.   This new funding includes up to

20   $50 million for the Administration for

21   Children's Services in New York City.

22           And before I close, I'd be remiss if I

23   didn't acknowledge you, Senator Montgomery.

24   This is your last Human Services Budget
                                                           15

 1   Hearing, I understand.   When I was here

 2   earlier in the week doing some meetings, I

 3   ran into a group of young people, a large

 4   group of young people proudly wearing their

 5   YouthBuild t-shirts, and they reminded me,

 6   obviously, of you.

 7           So it's been a pleasure.     You have

 8   been a fierce and tireless advocate for

 9   children and families.   I will miss you.       And

10   I look forward to our final session together.

11           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     Thank you.

12           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    I thank you

13   again for the opportunity to address all of

14   you, and I look forward to your questions.

15           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

16           So today's hearing the Assembly is

17   coordinating, so I'll go first to the chair

18   of our Children and Families Committee, Ellen

19   Jaffee, for some questions.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Thank you very

21   much.

22           Thank you very much, Commissioner, for

23   your advocacy, the work that you've been

24   doing, and the opportunity to speak today, as
                                                      16

 1   well as on a personal level we've had the

 2   chance to review some of the issues of

 3   concern.

 4         But I do want to review some of the

 5   concerns, and I wanted to ask you -- as

 6   noted, the budget does include 75 million,

 7   which you know, will help counties with their

 8   ability -- their compliance with the federal

 9   Family First Prevention Act, $50 million for

10   the statewide compliance, 25 for the

11   counties, giving them the opportunity, if

12   they have the expired Title IV-E

13   demonstration projects -- this way, they can

14   have that support.

15         How will the funding work in terms of

16   meeting the requirements of the Family First

17   Prevention Act?   Can you provide, you know,

18   more details about the Title IV-E

19   demonstration projects and how they work and

20   how this will come into support?

21         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Sure.   So

22   just going back to your question about the

23   Title IV-E demonstration projects, they date

24   back I think five or six years ago.    And New
                                                       17

 1   York City was the only county in New York

 2   State to take advantage of a Title IV-E

 3   waiver that the feds allowed municipalities

 4   to use Title IV-E funding in sort of new

 5   ways, in unrestricted ways, to test out

 6   evidence-based models of care.

 7           And so New York City took advantage of

 8   that.   They've had some success in adopting

 9   several models of evidence-based care that

10   have had some really good outcomes.     They've

11   reduced caseloads for foster-care workers.

12           But unfortunately, those federal

13   waivers expired, and so there was no

14   replacement funding strategy for that.     And

15   so for many states who had really deeply

16   invested in these IV-E waivers, sort of the

17   bottom was going to drop out of these new

18   programs and services that were really

19   showing some promise.

20           And so many states, including

21   New York -- and with our partners in New York

22   City -- we have made a lot of noise in

23   Washington about the need, if we're going to

24   be successful in implementing the new Family
                                                     18

 1   First federal act, that we need to find ways

 2   to not only continue those waiver services

 3   that were allowable under the previous

 4   waiver, but also give states additional new

 5   dollars to help us do the many things that

 6   are now required for us to comply with the

 7   federal statute that will take effect here in

 8   New York in 2021.

 9         So the money that is appropriated in

10   the budget, so the 75 million, Assemblywoman,

11   approximately 21.4 of that will be for the

12   general use for us as a state to consider how

13   we can use those funds to sort of carry on

14   the work that we began last year with the $3

15   million transition fund -- so ways of

16   recruiting and supporting kinship relatives,

17   you know, doing kinship support groups, sort

18   of whatever it takes for us.

19         You know, there's a lot of provisions

20   in Family First about independent assessors

21   and agencies having to meet QRTP standards.

22   There are a lot of things that we still have

23   to find a way to fund and to do.

24         So that's our thinking.   We haven't
                                                        19

 1   developed, you know, our plan for request for

 2   proposals yet, but it's a one-shot.    So it's

 3   -- $20 million, as you know, is not a huge

 4   amount of money for a state as large as ours,

 5   and we want to be very thoughtful and

 6   strategic about how we use that investment.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     Well, within

 8   the Families First Prevention Act, how do you

 9   define what the -- how they have qualified

10   for the residential -- what -- what is --

11   what creates a qualified group for

12   residential treatment?   What is the

13   qualifying need?

14         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Yeah.   Yeah.

15   So this new federal act, which New York State

16   took advantage of a two-year waiver --

17   because there were many questions, and that

18   was among them.    So what does it really mean

19   for residential programs to be considered a

20   QRTP, a Qualified Residential Treatment

21   Program?

22         So those programs, under the new

23   federal definition, will need to adopt or be

24   able to implement trauma responsive models of
                                                         20

 1   care.   They must have nursing services.     They

 2   must provide up to six months of after-care

 3   for children in their care.     They must do

 4   significant outreach to families of children

 5   who have wound up in residential care.

 6           And so looking across our current

 7   service system in New York, we believe that

 8   many of our current residential providers

 9   would meet that QRTP designation.

10           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Can you share

11   the impact of the market rate that went into

12   effect last year?   What is the statewide

13   cost, you know, for that increase?      Is there

14   consideration being given to returning the

15   market rate to the 75th percentile, which was

16   recommended by the federal government?

17           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   So

18   New York -- so we're on to childcare now,

19   just, right, switching gears a bit.     So

20   New York State maintains, as a result of the

21   last year's market rate, a 69th percentile

22   rate, which is among the highest in this

23   nation.   We watch where we stand in

24   comparison to other states.     So we remain
                                                     21

 1   among the top states in preparing for the

 2   market rate at 69th percentile.

 3         This year, this fall, we will again --

 4   it will be our cycle to do a new market rate

 5   analysis, so that will give us another

 6   opportunity to do a sampling of a variety, a

 7   stratification of providers across the state.

 8   And so that survey allows us to really ask

 9   providers what is the actual cost of care

10   that is providing for you.    We collect that

11   information, and then we begin to determine

12   how we can continue to support the cost to

13   childcare providers.

14         So again, that would mean that our new

15   market rates, Assemblywoman, would take

16   effect in the fall of 2021.

17         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    There is -- I

18   have concern -- the Executive proposed

19   eliminating the 18.42 percent state share for

20   outside-New York City residential placements

21   for children with disabilities by, you know,

22   the Committee on Special Education.   Which

23   the cost will be -- will be by the school

24   districts, then, which is a concern in terms
                                                      22

 1   of how the school districts are going to be

 2   able to maintain that stability, having to

 3   then add -- this is added to their cost and

 4   impacts their budget.

 5           Can you explain the purpose of

 6   eliminating the funding and how it will

 7   then -- how we can -- the school districts,

 8   how they'll be able to maintain their

 9   stability?

10           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Sure.   So

11   the proposal in this year's budget is to

12   really create parity with what was already

13   done for New York City several years ago.

14   So, you know, these children, frankly, the

15   payment for the CSE really does not belong in

16   the Office of Children and Family Services

17   budget.     These are not children in foster

18   care.   These are not children in prevention

19   services.    These are children who are a

20   school district's responsibility to provide

21   services for.

22           So it is -- it's shifting

23   responsibility in the budget where we believe

24   responsibility lies for these Committee on
                                                         23

 1   Preschool Education and Special Education

 2   Services for Children.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:   We should then

 4   also increase funding for our school

 5   districts.   I'm very concerned that this will

 6   really negatively impact in terms of their

 7   ability to provide the programs and the

 8   education that is necessary.     So this is an

 9   issue we need to follow up on.

10           The budget, the '19-'20 budget

11   implemented the Family First Transition Fund

12   that included $3 million.   Are there any

13   updates that you could provide regarding this

14   fund?   Is the $3 million in the Executive

15   proposal added on top of last year's funding?

16   How did this work?

17           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Yeah.    Good.

18   So lots of questions there.

19           So last year when we passed the

20   budget, that included the $3 million fund.

21   In May we distributed all of the funding out

22   to every local social service district in the

23   state, including New York City.    And we asked

24   them to submit a plan to us about how they
                                                       24

 1   planned to use that money.     Again, to better

 2   support the recruitment and retention of

 3   foster parents, but with a real specific

 4   focus on doing a better job in supporting our

 5   kinship families.

 6            So those counties all submitted plans

 7   to us outlining their strategies.    All of

 8   those plans are up on our OCFS Family First

 9   website, so I'd encourage all of you to take

10   a look at those plans.

11            And so we've been following those

12   activities on the local level, and they've

13   done some great things, ranging from new

14   marketing campaigns to starting focus groups

15   for kinship and foster families.    Some have

16   used the money in creative ways to help

17   kinship families and foster families who

18   might not otherwise -- maybe their house

19   needed smoke detectors or something to meet

20   the certification standards.    So there's been

21   a lot of good work and activity across the

22   state.

23            So we are adding an additional

24   $3 million to this year's budget to be able
                                                           25

 1   to continue those efforts across the state,

 2   and that will be in addition to the

 3   $21.4 million that we expect to receive from

 4   the federal government.

 5         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.     We

 6   go to the Senate now.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:       Thank you.    We've

 8   been joined by Senator Sue Serino, the ranker

 9   on -- Social Services?    Thank you.

10         And our first questioner is Velmanette

11   Montgomery, chair of Children and Families.

12         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:       Good

13   morning.

14         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:       Good morning,

15   Commissioner.   Good morning.    I'm trying to

16   get the microphone to work.

17         Thank you for those kind words.

18         I want to just ask you, if you will,

19   you mentioned in your remarks that -- let me

20   just give you a little of background.        We did

21   some traveling around the state to speak to

22   people who were the front-line people

23   providing services in various aspects of your

24   particular area.
                                                      26

 1         And one of the things that kept coming

 2   up which I found very interesting, that

 3   people all over the state, an issue that

 4   people are grappling with is how do we

 5   improve our system to better address what you

 6   have identified as biases that people have

 7   that perhaps are unintended.   So I interpret

 8   that as culturally competent ways of looking

 9   at what happens with children and families.

10         And you talked about a blind removal

11   process.   I'm just wondering where you are in

12   terms of having counties across the state

13   look at this particular tool in a way that is

14   effective to address the issue of being more

15   sensitive and removing this unintended bias

16   that we bring with us in our work.

17         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Thank you,

18   Senator.   Happy to talk about that.

19         So just by way of -- before I answer

20   your question, Senator, just by way of

21   introduction to the topic, you know, while I

22   mentioned in my remarks that we continue,

23   unlike many states, to see a decline in the

24   overall number of children in foster care in
                                                       27

 1   our state, we have failed to make really

 2   significant process in terms of the number of

 3   minority children who are in foster care.

 4         And so in a general sense in terms of

 5   kids in foster care -- and we have under

 6   16,000 kids in care.   Over 40 percent of the

 7   children in foster care in New York are

 8   children of color, mostly black and brown.

 9   So we've got a ways to go.

10         And so we have been watching for a

11   number of years a pilot initiative that

12   Nassau County Department of Social Services

13   undertook where it introduced a blind removal

14   process.   So it's relatively low demand in

15   cost, but it requires a different level of

16   decision-making as to when Child Protective

17   Services is considering the imminent risk

18   removal or removal of a child.

19         And so what Nassau County has done is

20   developed processes where they redact, they

21   de-identify information regarding parents or

22   a child's name, address, zip code, anything

23   that might, right, lead someone to make a

24   decision -- unintentionally.     As we all know
                                                     28

 1   from the work and training on it, this is the

 2   way our brains work, unfortunately.

 3         And what Nassau County experienced as

 4   a result of redacting that and making it

 5   blind, right, to race and ethnicity and other

 6   issues, is that -- not surprisingly, right --

 7   the number of black and brown children

 8   entering care in Nassau County declined

 9   significantly.

10         And so we have been working with a

11   number of other counties -- Westchester,

12   Onondaga, there's a number of other counties

13   who also wanted to adopt this.   So there's

14   been a curriculum that has been developed, in

15   partnership with the School of Social Work

16   here at SUNY Albany.   And frankly, the time

17   is now for us to require that every county in

18   the state adopt this blind removal process.

19         And so we at OCFS throughout 2020 will

20   be requiring all the counties to adopt this

21   curriculum and to adopt those practices as

22   they are making decisions -- a very critical

23   decision, obviously -- around children.

24         What I will also say, Senator, is that
                                                        29

 1   this seems like the logical place to start,

 2   right, in terms of child welfare

 3   decision-making.   It is the most difficult

 4   and impactful decision there is, when you're

 5   removing a child from their family.    But make

 6   no mistake about it, we are all aware that

 7   there are many other places in child welfare

 8   and in all human services, for that matter,

 9   where implicit bias enters into

10   decision-making and negatively impacts

11   families and communities of color.

12           So I am hopeful, after we roll out

13   this initiative of blind removals, that we

14   can then continue our work on where else in

15   our system, right, does implicit bias play a

16   role.

17           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   Thank you.   Thank

18   you for that.    And I hope you start with

19   New York City.

20           I just want to just briefly talk a

21   little bit about the Families First.    It's

22   very -- I'm inspired and encouraged that this

23   perhaps will be part of how we begin to

24   reduce the numbers of young people in care,
                                                       30

 1   especially the congregate care.

 2         My question to you is, to what extent

 3   have we been able to, one, create sort of a

 4   target that you have in mind to the numbers

 5   that you see us looking more like we should

 6   look, as it relates to how many children go

 7   into congregate care versus how many children

 8   either remain out of foster care or are in

 9   other family care?    And especially with a

10   sort of, I guess, a target focus on kinship

11   care in particular.

12         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Yes.   Yes.

13         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     Could you give us

14   an idea of where we are with that?

15         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    So when

16   Family First passed in 2017, right, we knew

17   that we had some ways to go in New York State

18   to sort of re-shift our focus.    And when you

19   look back in 2017 to New York State's

20   reliance on congregate care as compared to

21   other states in the country, we were above

22   the national average.

23         And so we began preparing data.     We

24   have provided every county in the State of
                                                      31

 1   New York with very detailed data analysis of

 2   where the children in those counties are

 3   placed, how many are in congregate care, what

 4   levels of congregate care, who are they, how

 5   long are they staying, as well as the number

 6   of children in foster care, the number of

 7   children in kinship foster care, and the

 8   number of children being cared for.

 9         And so we've done a lot of work since

10   2017, including all the things I've already

11   discussed, to really help counties begin to

12   think about making sure that the only

13   children entering congregate care are

14   children for whom there is no fit and willing

15   relative who would support, right, and

16   services that sometimes are not always made

17   available could be successful in a lower

18   level of care.

19         So we did, we did exactly what you

20   suggested and we set targets as a state.    So

21   we said that we would like all -- that we

22   would like, as a statewide target, at least

23   34 percent of kids in -- 30 percent, rather,

24   of children to be placed with kinship care.
                                                        32

 1           I am happy to say that as of today,

 2   statewide -- and it's because many of you

 3   have been beating this drum and supporting us

 4   in this work -- that today we have 34 percent

 5   of children in foster care placed in kinship

 6   care.

 7           Again, New York City is a little bit

 8   ahead of the rest of state, but the rest of

 9   the state is really making some very

10   significant progress.     So we are -- you know,

11   we're excited about that.

12           But, you know, you also have to make

13   sure that you're not just moving kids out of

14   congregate care, right?    Kids in congregate

15   care in our state are kids who have many,

16   many special needs.   Right?   So when we look

17   forward to Families First and what that will

18   mean -- no one is suggesting that there will

19   not always be a place for our congregate care

20   facilities, right, but we have to make sure

21   under Family First that only those children

22   who need that care get in there, that they

23   only stay for the right dose of time, as

24   determined by an independent assessor, not
                                                         33

 1   just local districts or the congregate care

 2   agencies.

 3            And that's where that culture, that

 4   sea change, right, that we have to sort of

 5   create here is going to be very challenging.

 6   And we're doing our best to work with our

 7   COFCCA partners, with all the local

 8   districts.    So we're on our way, but there is

 9   still a lot of work to be done in

10   anticipation of the effective date in

11   September of 2021.

12            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   Thank you.   And I

13   believe I see in the budget where we have

14   eliminated -- proposed to eliminate funding

15   for the Kinship Navigator.     So that seems to

16   be going in the opposite direction to what

17   you're saying, so we will continue to have

18   that discussion.

19            And thank you.   I hope we'll go far

20   beyond the 34 percent, but we're getting

21   there.

22            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I hope so

23   too, Senator.

24            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   Thank you.

 1         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 2         Assembly.

 3         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We've been

 4   joined by Assemblywoman Barrett, chair of our

 5   Veterans Committee; Assemblywoman Fahy;

 6   Assemblywoman Dickens.

 7         And we go to Assemblyman Hevesi for

 8   questions.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     We've also been

10   joined by Senator Brian Kavanagh.   Oh, excuse

11   me, and Senator Gustavo Rivera.

12         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.      So

13   now we go to Assemblyman Hevesi for

14   questions.

15         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     Hi, good morning,

16   Commissioner.

17         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Good

18   morning.

19         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     You know, I've

20   come to look forward to our time together at

21   these hearings.

22         (Laughter.)

23         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     So I'm going to

24   go quick, and there are some questions that
                                                      35

 1   I'm going to ask Chairwoman Weinstein to ask

 2   for me because I'm not going to get to them.

 3   So I haven't had coffee, I'm not going fast

 4   on purpose, I just -- there's a lot of topics

 5   I've got to get through.

 6            So first, let me start with a general

 7   thank you to OCFS and OTDA and the other O

 8   agencies and the agency staff for all the

 9   work they do.    You really do do a great job

10   under difficult circumstances, and I want to

11   say thank you.

12            A couple of other thank yous.   Thank

13   you for continuing the Family First

14   Transition Fund, appreciate that.   It's a

15   $3 million -- look for us to try to get that

16   up to 4.5 million, but we appreciate that.

17            I'd like to thank you for the

18   firewall, the kinship firewall.   Great

19   proposal, I think that will be very helpful.

20   Look from us, from the Assembly -- and I will

21   talk to my Senate colleagues -- about looking

22   to have an open-ended new funding stream

23   pulling KinGAP out of the Foster Care Block

24   Grant.
                                                      36

 1           In an effort to replicate the success

 2   we had with preventative services, we will

 3   drill down on what the right reimbursement

 4   for counties is.   But we believe that KinGAP

 5   is the future.   You're moving in that

 6   direction.   I think we should put some money

 7   behind it.

 8           Thank you for the childcare tax

 9   credit.   That's really impressive.    You've

10   been listening to the advocates, I appreciate

11   that.   And thank you for the childcare slots.

12   This is all good stuff.

13           Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to

14   ask you on four topics.   I'll ask them quick,

15   and you can take your time answering them and

16   I'll just go through.

17           In your Article VII language you have

18   some language about assessors, and it seems

19   that the assessor who will be making

20   determinations about placement of children

21   goes above and beyond the federal requirement

22   for Families First, and that gives me pause

23   and scares me a little bit.   So that's the

24   first one.   I'm going to keep going, so if
                                                       37

 1   you want to --

 2         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:

 3   {Inaudible.}.

 4         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     Yeah, sorry, it's

 5   the time constraint, I apologize.

 6         The second is COPS.     You have opened

 7   up the Community Optional Preventive Services

 8   program.   Just if you could touch on what the

 9   intent of that is, and make sure that the

10   programs that are already in there stay

11   whole, because there are some very good

12   programs in there.

13         Third topic -- and again, sorry for

14   throwing these all at you -- the

15   public/private partnership.   This funding is

16   already used to help vulnerable children and

17   families, and it has a private match.    What

18   are we doing with that?   I just want to make

19   sure that those programs stay whole.

20         And then the last question -- and I'm

21   sorry to bombard you -- apparently the

22   Childcare Availability Task Force made a

23   bunch of recommendations, but they're not

24   reflected in your budget.
                                                     38

 1         So I apologize for throwing all that

 2   at you.   But your thoughts?

 3         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Thank you,

 4   Assemblyman.   And I do appreciation your

 5   recognition of the work of my agency.

 6         So as for the independent assessors

 7   and the proposed language in our Article VII

 8   bill, our interpretation of the federal

 9   statute and regulations is clear, that the

10   feds expect that it is the role of the

11   independent assessor to determine the

12   appropriateness of the child's stay in

13   congregate care.

14         And if the independent assessor

15   determines -- they have 30 days, under the

16   federal law, to do their independent

17   assessment.    If at the end of that 30-day

18   assessment they come back and they say

19   "Sheila does not belong in a QRPT," it

20   requires that the county make an immediate

21   plan to transition that child to an

22   appropriate lower level of care.

23         So they will have up to 30 days,

24   following that 30-day assessment, to make a
                                                       39

 1   plan to move that child to the right level of

 2   care.

 3            After that 30 days of transitional

 4   funding, the Title IV-E money will go away

 5   for the entirety of that child's spell in

 6   care going forward.    So I want to put that

 7   there.

 8            The federal bill also sort of -- they

 9   complicated things, in our view, that they

10   also said there's an additional new Family

11   Court hearing at a 60-day mark.    However, the

12   federal language doesn't give any authority,

13   in our interpretation, to a Family Court

14   judge to overrule or overturn the

15   determination of the independent assessor.

16   Right?

17            So we are concerned that if an

18   independent assessor -- who the feds are

19   saying is really tied to the continuation of

20   these IV-E dollars -- says a child doesn't

21   need this level of care, well, first of all,

22   that was the whole point of Family First, is

23   to say someone needs to be asking hard

24   questions about whether or not this child --
                                                       40

 1   so it would seem that if an independent

 2   qualified assessor says they don't, we should

 3   be making plans to step them down or to look

 4   for relatives or a foster home.

 5         But we're also concerned, Assemblyman,

 6   that with that IV-E federal money clock

 7   ticking, we don't want to set counties up to

 8   unintentionally be assuming.    Right?     If

 9   they're going to lose IV-E funding, what

10   other funding stream, if they keep the kid in

11   congregate care, are they going to be using

12   to support that placement?

13         So that is why our Article VII was

14   intentionally written the way that it was.

15   So I hope that clarifies a bit for you.

16         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:      It helps.   It

17   does, thank you.

18         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     And again,

19   you know, a bill is the beginning of a

20   conversation.   Right?   And so we'll be -- I'm

21   looking forward to what our colleagues have

22   to say.

23         So COPS?

24         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:      Please.
                                                       41

 1           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Just to move

 2   quickly.   So Community Optional Preventive

 3   Services, for those of you who might not be

 4   familiar with it, has been around.     It has

 5   been the same funding stream, about

 6   $12.1 million.   We've been funding the same

 7   programs since 2008.

 8           And so as we are looking across all

 9   our funding streams at OCFS and we're asking

10   questions about when is the last time you

11   looked at this funding stream, is what's

12   being invested sort of in line with where we

13   are 11, 12 years later in terms of

14   Family First and other pressures and our work

15   towards kinship and foster families, what

16   we're simply saying is that the time has come

17   for us to open up COPS.

18           And our goal is to open up a

19   procurement that eliminates some of the

20   restrictions that currently exist in COPS.

21   Because there have been no changes to how

22   COPS funding has been able to be used since

23   2008.   It's now 2020.

24           So that's really our intention, is
                                                         42

 1   it's time to stop, open it back up to be more

 2   relevant, right, to where we are in 2020 in

 3   terms of the kinds of services and programs

 4   that we're trying to implement.

 5            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you,

 6   Commissioner.    Perhaps you could follow up

 7   with some of -- in more detail with

 8   information to the committee that we could

 9   share with the members.

10            So we'll go now to the Senate.

11            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

12            Senator Diane Savino.

13            SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you, Senator

14   Krueger.

15            Good morning, Commissioner.    I want to

16   thank you for the meeting we had earlier this

17   week where we talked about some of these

18   complicated issues, including the role of the

19   independent assessor and what -- what -- what

20   complications they could create for Families

21   First.

22            I do want to follow up with you,

23   though, at a later time on this blind removal

24   thing.    I think I might be the only person
                                                      43

 1   here -- although there are new members of the

 2   legislature -- I think I might be the only

 3   one that's ever done that work.   So I'm

 4   trying to figure out how it would work --

 5         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Yeah.

 6         SENATOR SAVINO:    -- and I don't want

 7   to waste our time here today.   It's

 8   interesting.

 9         I just want to quickly raise my

10   concern again about the failure to fund Close

11   to Home.   It is probably the most successful

12   program that we've created for young people

13   to turn their lives around.    And I'll say it

14   again, as a result of Close to Home, less

15   young people are winding up arrested and now

16   going through the Raise the Age program.

17         I also want to raise my concern about

18   the fact that the city has the bulk of the

19   kids in the Raise the Age program, and

20   they're not getting any money from the state.

21   That's fundamentally unfair.    We need to

22   change that.

23         Two other points.   I'm very concerned

24   about the workforce.   We have, over the
                                                     44

 1   years, shifted almost the entire burden of

 2   child welfare services, with the exception of

 3   protective services, to the nonprofit sector.

 4   And the turnover in those agencies is

 5   extraordinary.   And that is equally

 6   traumatizing to children, every time they

 7   lose someone who is working with them.

 8          We need to do something about

 9   stabilizing this workforce.   Everyone cannot

10   work for the government, and somebody has to

11   work directly with these families.     So we

12   find more creative ways to either do tuition

13   loan forgiveness for social workers in the

14   nonprofit sector the way we do loan

15   forgiveness in the public sector.    But it's

16   critically important that we stabilize these

17   agencies.   They really are the ones who are

18   doing the hard work right now.   Not to take

19   anything away from my own union, but they're

20   not doing foster care anymore.

21          One other thing I would like to point

22   out.   I know you can't talk about what

23   happened in Suffolk County, it's too soon.

24   But what I would hope that you could convey
                                                       45

 1   to members is don't jump in with legislation

 2   to fix a problem that you might not

 3   understand.   There's more to every case, and

 4   we cannot second-guess our workforce every

 5   time a bad case makes the headlines.   There's

 6   a lot of people that play a role in whether

 7   or not children are removed or whether or not

 8   there's intervention.

 9         So I just would ask you to convey that

10   message to everyone.    Calm down, we don't

11   need 50 bills changing the child welfare

12   system thinking that they can solve the

13   problem.

14         And finally, last year we passed a

15   bill on preserving family bonds which would

16   allow for post-termination visitation in

17   particular cases.   We broke down over a

18   potential chapter amendment.    We still firmly

19   believe in this, that these young people who

20   want to have connections to their parents

21   post-termination should, in certain

22   circumstances.

23         And I understand your department is

24   going to bring forward a departmental bill.
                                                        46

 1   So if you are, I would appreciate -- let's do

 2   it, and let's do it quickly.     I think that's

 3   a victory that we can have for some young

 4   people whose lives have been disrupted by the

 5   system, for better or worse, and they can

 6   have some continuity with their families.

 7            So I think that's it.   Thank you.

 8            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I would just

 9   reflect back, Senator.    You know, your prior

10   experience as a worker in the Administration

11   for Children and Families shines through.     In

12   your role as Senator you raise all very

13   important, very challenging issues that, as

14   you know and I think appreciate, we work

15   toward every day at OCFS.

16            And with respect to legislation,

17   right, it is a new year, a new time for, you

18   know, the reintroduction of things that

19   didn't happen perhaps in 2019, and we are

20   always open to having those conversations

21   again.    So thank you.

22            And I also want to especially express

23   my thanks to you for your comments.    So the

24   Senator is referring to what I'm sure you're
                                                     47

 1   all aware was a horrific fatality of an

 2   8-year-old child in Suffolk County that has

 3   been devastating for everyone involved,

 4   including the child protective staff in that

 5   county.

 6         And so because of confidentiality, I

 7   know you all appreciate the fact that we

 8   cannot speak about the case, but I do want to

 9   echo the Senator's caution that it is often

10   during times of a case crisis that we --

11   everyone feels a sense of responsibility to

12   do something, and I appreciate that.   But

13   sometimes what we choose to do in the short

14   term is sort of done hastily, and it's not

15   always the right remedy to the solution.

16         So again, I think as we continue our

17   open dialogue and work together, there are

18   ways that we can continue.    And I hope -- I

19   hope -- if nothing else, that you see me, as

20   commissioner of OCFS, committed to always

21   working toward that goal.

22         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

23         We now go to Assemblyman Walczyk.

24         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:    Thank you.
                                                     48

 1         As Mr. Hevesi was saying, and I

 2   appreciate all of his questions, the

 3   Executive Budget eliminates 3.5 million in

 4   P-3 funding.   Nonprofits who have created

 5   pragmatic and successful programs will be

 6   affected here.   Can you point to some

 7   assessment that would have forced this to be

 8   eliminated?

 9         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   So I think,

10   Assemblyman, that the short answer to that is

11   that it is part of our contribution, if you

12   will, to trying to assist in helping close

13   the state's budget gap.

14         You know, I can't say for sure, but as

15   we had sort of the COPS conversation, it is a

16   possibility that some of those programs that

17   may no longer be receiving the public/private

18   partnership money, you know, might be able to

19   respond to the procurement of the COPS

20   funding.   But I can't guarantee that.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:   But from your

22   agency's perspective there's no assessment

23   that you've done that says, you know, these

24   programs aren't proven or this program should
                                                       49

 1   be eliminated, the 3.5 million?

 2            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   You know, I

 3   think our overall assessment has been that

 4   all things considered, where we are making

 5   our investments, that that $3.5 million is a

 6   place where I think we have the opportunity

 7   to provide services in other ways.     Many of

 8   those programs are local programs, with all

 9   due respect, you know, to the work that they

10   are doing, so we're not achieving sort of a

11   statewide practice change as a result of

12   those.

13            But again, whenever we have to make

14   these very difficult decisions, we will do

15   whatever we can through other potential

16   funding mechanisms to make that continuation

17   possible.

18            ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:   I appreciate

19   that.    Thank you, Commissioner.

20            And I think as you sort of segued to

21   COPS as well, if that's opened up, is there

22   an assessment that shows that the agencies

23   that are currently funded through there

24   aren't doing a great job or, you know --
                                                      50

 1          OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   You know, I

 2   think my answer is that, you know, COPS was

 3   created a long time ago.    And that again, we

 4   are 12 years ahead now.    Our pressures to do

 5   business differently, our driving toward more

 6   kinship care and doing things sort of -- you

 7   know, allow us to ask ourselves the question,

 8   which I think we should be, is it time to

 9   open this up and try and modernize some of

10   the funding available.

11          ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:    I would love to

12   see something on paper there, and maybe your

13   agency can send me something.   Because I see

14   those current funding streams as pragmatic

15   progress, the way that the Governor likes to

16   be on it, and I think they've done a great

17   job.

18          The average New York family is

19   spending $16,000 annually on childcare.   The

20   next couple of questions are real big

21   picture.   How can we reduce that cost?

22          OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   {Chuckling.}

23   That is, Assemblyman, you know, the

24   million-dollar question.   And, you know, I
                                                       51

 1   know and you all know that the Governor's

 2   Childcare Task Force -- and they are an

 3   amazing group of individuals.    They are

 4   smart, they are fierce, they have rolled up

 5   their sleeves and done, you know, an amazing

 6   amount of work.    And they're fierce, and they

 7   are determined to make recommendations for

 8   change here.    And you'll be hearing, I'm

 9   sure, from many of them when they speak

10   later.

11            You know, the challenge for us is in

12   spite of all of the investments that we make

13   on a state level -- the tax credit, our high

14   market rate, the number of children tapping

15   into subsidy, all the good things that I

16   listed out in my testimony -- and even with

17   additional federal dollars coming, you know,

18   the truth is that this is a huge economic

19   issue to solve across the country, and we're

20   no different in New York.

21            And so I think the question before us

22   is even with the state's investments, with

23   the money we get from the federal government,

24   right, we are still falling short in, you
                                                           52

 1   know, meeting the needs for families who --

 2   working families who rely on subsidy.

 3            And the cost of care is high.      And for

 4   good reason, right?    Because we have a highly

 5   regulated system.    We put a lot of value and

 6   emphasis on health and safety, you know,

 7   regulations here.    So it's a very challenging

 8   issue.

 9            ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:   One final one,

10   and you mentioned this as an issue

11   country-wide.    I couldn't agree more.      We

12   have an interesting demographic in New York

13   State, and I just wonder what you'd think

14   about rural areas and recruiting additional

15   providers.    Right now it's not even so much

16   the cost as it is the access to childcare for

17   a lot of the area that I represent.

18            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Yeah.    I

19   think that the workforce and the salaries for

20   the childcare workforce and the childcare

21   deserts and the particular challenges in

22   rural communities are just another dimension,

23   right, of the challenges for us to be

24   solving.
                                                        53

 1         You're right, it is more challenging

 2   in some of those rural communities.    And

 3   grappling with the salary structure and what

 4   childcare workers make in New York and across

 5   the country is in fact, you know, one of the

 6   major components, I think, of the discussions

 7   of the task force and the things we are

 8   struggling with moving forward.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

10         We've been joined by Assemblywoman

11   Wright.    And now to the Senate.

12         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.   We've

13   been joined by Senator Tedisco.

14         And our next questioner will be chair

15   of Social Services, Roxanne Persaud.

16         SENATOR PERSAUD:    Good morning,

17   Commissioner.   It's always great to see you

18   and to work with you.

19         I am -- in the interest of time, I'm

20   just going to go through some questions that

21   we have.

22         In reference to special education

23   residential placement, can you tell us what's

24   driving the proposal that the Governor has
                                                       54

 1   sent in the budget of the cost shift?    Can

 2   you provide us the financial breakdown for

 3   school districts?    Do you have a geographical

 4   map of where these placements are?

 5         Also in terms of that, has the state

 6   consulted with the educational stakeholders

 7   on this proposal?    The cost shift is -- it's

 8   something that we're very concerned with, as

 9   you know.     We've had that conversation.

10         Do you also know what is the average

11   maintenance cost for the special ed

12   placement?

13         In terms of the Childcare Availability

14   Task Force, can you provide us a status

15   update on the recommendations that were made?

16   Also, do you anticipate that the task force

17   will be holding any hearings in the near

18   future so that everyone -- the public will

19   have input?

20         Then in terms of the rightsizing of

21   youth facilities, we know that a facility is

22   going to be closed, it's on notice to be

23   closed, it's located in Delaware County.     Is

24   there going to be an impact on the workforce?
                                                       55

 1   What are the plans for that facility?    And

 2   are there any other facilities that are

 3   underutilized at this time that are on the

 4   list to be closed in the near future?

 5         Okay.   I'll give you that, and then

 6   I'll come back for my next one.

 7         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Okay, great.

 8   Thank you.

 9         So with respect to the proposal to

10   shift -- it is approximated to be about

11   $22 million out of OCFS's budget, and to

12   shift that to the State Education Department.

13   And that is in the overall context of trying

14   to close the budget gap, Senator.

15         I do not have the distribution by

16   school district of that, nor the actual rate.

17   I can certainly follow up with you, but I do

18   not have that analysis at this point in time.

19         With respect to the Childcare

20   Availability Task Force, so just to be clear,

21   though the task force has been meeting

22   regularly, the final report of the task force

23   is due in December of this year.    I do not

24   believe as of now that public hearings are
                                                      56

 1   contemplated.   But there have been,

 2   obviously, regular and ongoing meetings.

 3           And, you know, so the task force has

 4   not issued its final recommendations yet,

 5   although I know that members of the task

 6   force had hoped to see deeper investments in

 7   the budget.   But again, that is part of the

 8   discussion we had about the challenge, right,

 9   and just the magnitude of what is needed

10   here.

11           And then thirdly, Senator, with

12   respect to the proposed closure of one of our

13   juvenile residential facilities, it's the

14   Youth Leadership Academy that you're

15   referring to.   It is located in South

16   Kortright in Delaware County.   It is a 25-bed

17   limited secure facility, and it has been

18   significantly underutilized over the past

19   couple of years.   So on average, we've had

20   seven or eight young people there.

21           And because we have the -- so it's not

22   cost-effective, frankly, to continue to

23   operate that program.   And we do have

24   availability in our other OCFS limited-secure
                                                        57

 1   facilities to accommodate those young people.

 2         No layoffs will happen as a result of

 3   this, so we have already met with the staff

 4   at YLA.   We have other OCFS facilities in the

 5   Rochester area, in Finger Lakes.    And so

 6   those staff who work at YLA will have first

 7   priority for any vacancies at OCFS, and then

 8   they will also go through the civil service

 9   ARTL process where they are prioritized for

10   any other civil service positions in other

11   state agencies for which they qualify.       And

12   also it's a year closure notice, so we'll

13   have a year to work through that process with

14   the staff.

15         And as for the future intended use of

16   the facility once it's vacated, no decisions

17   that I'm aware of have been made yet.

18         SENATOR PERSAUD:   Okay.   Quickly, can

19   you tell us about the TANF cost shift in the

20   FFFS services?   Can you give us some

21   highlights of that?

22         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     So the

23   proposal in the budget is to increase the

24   child welfare threshold under the FFFS, the
                                                       58

 1   Flexible Funding for Families.    So that also

 2   sits in OTDA's budget.    It's all TANF

 3   funding.   I think the total FFFS is around

 4   $954 million.

 5         The current child welfare threshold

 6   that has been in effect is about

 7   $342 million.    The proposal calls for that

 8   threshold to increase to $382 million.

 9         So what that means as a practical

10   matter, because it's complicated, is that

11   local districts will be required to spend

12   more of their federal FFFS money before they

13   can tap into the state's 62/38 enhanced

14   reimbursement.

15         So what that may mean for counties

16   is -- it may not necessarily mean a cut in

17   child welfare services, but it is assumed

18   that it will require counties to sort of go

19   back to their FFFS funding, which allows them

20   to pay for a number of services, including a

21   lot of administration costs are in FFFS.    But

22   there's other services.

23         And this increase in the threshold is

24   likely to result in districts having to make
                                                       59

 1   some decisions about how they prioritize the

 2   use of their FFFS.

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So, Commissioner,

 4   I think we've seen a pattern now.   People

 5   have a long list of questions for you, and

 6   then the clock goes off and you want to

 7   answer.   What we've done in other hearings --

 8   you have staff here.   If you will please,

 9   your staff, take careful notes, get the

10   answers that you were not able to complete in

11   the time frame for anyone who's asking

12   questions.

13         If you send them to Helene and I, we

14   will make sure all of our colleagues get the

15   letter from you explaining the answers.

16   Because I don't want to show any disrespect

17   for my colleagues or for you being able to

18   answer, but we have these time clocks for a

19   reason.

20         So with that, I'm going to send it

21   back over to the Assembly.

22         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

23         And as my cochair says, just a

24   reminder to members that the time is for both
                                                       60

 1   your question and answer.

 2         Assemblywoman Fahy for questions.

 3         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:    Thank you.

 4         Good morning, Commissioner.     Thank you

 5   for being here.   And always good to see you.

 6         And I want to start with just a couple

 7   of comments.   It is good to see that we are

 8   seeing some federal increases.   So many other

 9   areas that we touch into, whether it's the

10   environment or water infrastructure or roads,

11   where we're seeing a rollback.   So it is good

12   to see in a few areas where you are

13   mentioning the increases from the feds.   So

14   that's somewhat encouraging, given the

15   pushback.

16         I also want to commend the increase on

17   Raise the Age -- that's something that has

18   really helped up here with implementation --

19   and also pleased on some of the kinship care

20   as well.

21         A couple of questions, something I

22   have not heard mentioned.   One was the home

23   visiting programs, which you know are near

24   and dear to me and I think would go a long
                                                       61

 1   way, since we've heard a lot today about

 2   child abuse and child preventive services.

 3         The Healthy Families New York, I think

 4   you've proposed -- the Governor has proposed

 5   level funding on that.    And yet the need -- I

 6   think we're serving the tiniest fraction of

 7   those who could be served or be eligible.

 8   Can you talk about that, and if there's any

 9   room for moving the needle on that funding?

10         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Sure.   So

11   we're very proud, and thank you for your

12   acknowledgment of our evidence-based Healthy

13   Families program.    So the budget does

14   maintain $26 million of stable funding for

15   the program.   And we serve about 6,000

16   families a year.    I think we conduct over

17   70,000 home visits to families.   So it's a

18   very effective program.

19         You know, one of the opportunities --

20   and it's not a this-year thing necessarily,

21   Assemblywoman, but one of the things that we

22   do look forward to is -- again, back to all

23   things Family First -- that down the road

24   when we submit our prevention plan, home
                                                        62

 1   visiting programs are one of the

 2   evidence-based models that are in the federal

 3   clearinghouse that we can potentially invest

 4   IV-E dollars into using to expand,

 5   potentially, Healthy Families down the road.

 6         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:      Yeah, I think the

 7   evidence is profound, decades of evidence on

 8   home visiting programs in general.     And we'd

 9   love to work with you on really expanding

10   that package.   I'd love to see us down the

11   road look at universal access for those

12   programs or universal services for all

13   families, because I do think it is profound,

14   that very earliest of intervention.

15         The second question is on DV.     You

16   mentioned in your testimony that there is a

17   growing issue of domestic violence.    And

18   certainly we've read a -- you know, I read a

19   lot of the national numbers.    And then you've

20   also proposed a new fund for flexible

21   domestic violence services.

22         Can you mention what the growing --

23   you know, what numbers you're seeing on

24   domestic violence in terms of the growing
                                                     63

 1   problem, and then where the flexible domestic

 2   violence program has come from?

 3         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    So I will

 4   certainly say from my child welfare hat and

 5   my experience, you know, the prevalence of

 6   domestic violence in child protective service

 7   reports is astonishing.   It is everywhere,

 8   seemingly.

 9         We're also, right, knowing from some

10   very serious cases reported in the news

11   across the country -- Staten Island, New York

12   City, out in the western part of the state.

13   You know, too many murders, deaths, acts of

14   violence.    And I think it's just -- it's

15   nationally recognized.

16         You know, whether it's actually an

17   uptick versus more awareness and folks are

18   coming forward, you know, that's always a

19   question for us.

20         But what we do know is at the end of

21   the day we need to do much more across the

22   system to do more prevention, to really help

23   our service providers who are now, you know,

24   working to meet survivors where they are,
                                                       64

 1   where they're at.

 2         Our domestic violence model of funding

 3   in New York State has really not changed

 4   significantly in 30 years.    And, you know, as

 5   I'm spending more and more time in state

 6   government, there's a lot of things that we

 7   really have not taken a look at -- models

 8   that were built, you know, 10, 20, 30 years

 9   ago that have sort of stayed the same.

10         And as we look across the country and

11   other states, we see new models of

12   innovation.     And so as we're doing our work

13   on the task force, we have NYSCADV, we have

14   many of our domestic violence service

15   providers.    And so the way that we fund our

16   shelter system now is sort of inflexible in

17   some respects.    And so we want to sort of

18   test out some new funding models.

19         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     I'm almost out of

20   time, so I just want to add I'd love to hear

21   more on that.    And then, finally, just want

22   to add that the workforce training that you

23   mentioned for the nonprofits, and that some

24   of my colleagues mentioned, would love to
                                                       65

 1   hear more on that point, given the turnover

 2   rates really do impact services.

 3         Thank you, Chair.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 5         Senate?

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7   Senator Rachel May.

 8         SENATOR MAY:    Thank you.

 9         And thank you, Commissioner.

10         I have just a couple of quick

11   questions.   One is -- I represent Syracuse,

12   and we have a sad statistic in Syracuse that

13   about 10 percent of the students in the

14   school district are functionally homeless,

15   which means a lot of them are couch surfing

16   on friends', families' couches and that sort

17   of thing.

18         I'm wondering if you have any systems

19   in place to identify kids who are facing

20   those kinds of challenges and to help them

21   get the services they need.

22         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Yeah, that's

23   a very sobering statistic, Senator.

24         We don't at OCFS, you know, work with
                                                      66

 1   the schools in that way or track those

 2   statistics.   You know, the way that sort of

 3   child welfare system would have knowledge is

 4   if there's some reason to believe that those

 5   children are being maltreated, and a call

 6   would be made to the SCR.

 7         But we don't at OCFS.      But maybe our

 8   colleagues at OTDA -- I don't want to

 9   speak -- but as part of their homeless

10   prevention may do some work in that area, but

11   we do not at OCFS.

12         SENATOR MAY:   Okay.    Thank you.

13         And my other question is about the --

14   I was encouraged to hear about the REDC

15   program actually identifying childcare as a

16   priority.   One of the complaints I hear about

17   state economic development is that it tends

18   to prioritize new projects and

19   entrepreneurial projects when there are a lot

20   of things out there that could employ people

21   tomorrow if they just had more funding.

22   So -- and childcare is one of those areas

23   where, if we could just pay childcare workers

24   more, we could employ a whole lot more
                                                       67

 1   people, we could keep the childcare workers

 2   off of public assistance, we could make it a

 3   job that people wanted to go into at higher

 4   rates.

 5            Is there -- when those regional

 6   economic development decisions are being

 7   made, is that being taken into account, that

 8   we just want to beef up programs that are

 9   already out there?

10            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I am not an

11   expert in the REDCs, to be honest with you.

12            You know, I think that the -- all the

13   issues that you articulated are -- many of

14   them are issues of the broader task force and

15   of the broader challenge in childcare in

16   New York State.    You know, I think we wanted

17   to take advantage of the REDCs, who have

18   their own very specific purpose, right, in

19   sparking, you know, regional economic

20   development and growth.   And I think the

21   Governor and the Lieutenant Governor's

22   message to them was while you're doing that,

23   don't forget -- right -- if you're building

24   new businesses, to take childcare into
                                                       68

 1   consideration.   And to your point, they have

 2   clearly responded to that.

 3           You know, how much we can expect them,

 4   you know, to own as part of the greater

 5   childcare problem, you know, I think remains

 6   to be seen.   But I think it is amazing in a

 7   very short period of time, right -- in only a

 8   year -- that almost $16 million have been

 9   sort of in acknowledgment of the overall

10   childcare challenge, so.

11           SENATOR MAY:   Great.   Thank you very

12   much.

13           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    You're

14   welcome.

15           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

16           Assembly?

17           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

18   Assemblywoman Barrett.

19           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Good morning.

20   Nice to see you.    And thank you for all

21   you're doing and your leadership in this

22   really essential area.

23           I share the comments or support many

24   of the comments that my colleagues raised.
                                                       69

 1   But I just want to focus on workforce and the

 2   whole notion of care continuum.    One of my

 3   great frustrations in government is all the

 4   silos and how -- you know, when you try to

 5   look at something that works across agencies,

 6   there's always kind of roadblocks and, you

 7   know, why that should happen.    And I know

 8   there's been an effort in some of the areas,

 9   you know, in Veterans and in Ag and in EnCon,

10   to work across those agencies.

11            But I think that there's a real need

12   in this state for a caregiving continuum that

13   starts with childcare, goes through the aging

14   and the senior population, but in between

15   addresses families with kids with special

16   needs.    And so it would be kind of an OPWDD,

17   you know, your agency, OMH, and Aging working

18   together, potentially with SUNY, to look at

19   how we could be doing a better job of

20   creating a professional caregiving workforce

21   that has the prestige and has the career

22   possibilities commensurate with the essential

23   work that they're doing in our communities.

24            And so often this population is -- the
                                                     70

 1   caregivers are women, women of color, often

 2   immigrant women, family members, who are

 3   often the daughters and the wives who are

 4   unpaid.   But I feel like we can't just kind

 5   of put Band-Aids on this and look for

 6   short-term patches rather than address this

 7   in a more holistic and more statewide way.

 8         And one -- you know, some of us have

 9   been looking at the idea of a caregiving

10   fund, a workforce fund that we would put in

11   the budget, you know, and look for innovative

12   solutions in the -- you know, either

13   regionally, for starters, or have it be

14   across the state.

15         And I wondered what you think about

16   that and whether it's something you could

17   support and see working with colleagues

18   around.

19         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I -- you

20   know, I would acknowledge wholeheartedly

21   that -- and I think as you speak to my other

22   colleagues leading other human service

23   agencies, that workforce is in every

24   conversation.   It is a challenge in every
                                                       71

 1   corner of our work, the not-for-profits and

 2   state government and all of our human service

 3   agencies as well.    And I am more than willing

 4   to sit and, you know, dialogue with you about

 5   your ideas.

 6         You know, the Governor has a new

 7   leader of workforce development on behalf of

 8   the state, Madhuri, she's fantastic.    So I

 9   know we would absolutely be willing to sit

10   down, think this through, think about how we

11   can develop some of those strategies.

12         Because, you know, to your point about

13   sort of being siloed, right, it's not really

14   the best way to sort of maximize all the

15   resources and thinking because we're all

16   sharing the same challenges across many

17   sectors.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Thank you, I

19   appreciate that.    Because I think people

20   often do say, Well, we're just talking about

21   childcare, we're not talking about older

22   people or people, you know, that need help

23   with caregiving on a daily basis, or working

24   in an agency.   And it is, it's a crisis, and
                                                      72

 1   it's a crisis that's only going to grow,

 2   which I'm sure we'll talk about when the

 3   commissioner of Aging is here.

 4         But it is a continuum, and I

 5   appreciate that and would love to engage with

 6   you on that further.   Thank you.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

 8   Senate?

 9         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator Sue

10   Serino.

11         SENATOR SERINO:   Good morning,

12   Chairwoman Poole.   And today I wear two hats,

13   I'm the ranker on Social Services and the

14   ranker on Aging.

15         And I know that we've had this

16   conversation a few times about extending the

17   hours of the Elder Abuse Hotline for -- to

18   make it eventually 24/7.   We know abuse

19   doesn't just happen between the hours of 9:00

20   to 5:00.   The Governor has expressed support

21   for the initiative but said that it needed to

22   be handled within the context of the budget.

23         And in 2018, we were able to have a

24   compromise in the budget when the Senate
                                                        73

 1   fought for and we were able to secure an

 2   extension of the hours for the Elder Abuse

 3   Hotline for a minimum of three additional

 4   hours per day, Monday through Friday, from

 5   5:00 at night to 8:00 p.m. at night.     And the

 6   Senate added $326,000 to ensure this was

 7   done, which is a minuscule amount of money

 8   when you think about our big budget.

 9            So my questions -- the first one is,

10   what is the status of the extended hours for

11   the Elder Abuse Hotline right now?

12            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   So I'm happy

13   to say that we continue to provide those

14   extended hours.

15            I also want to point out when we look

16   at the statistics for the numbers of calls

17   being made to the Protective Services Hotline

18   at our Human Services Call Center, we

19   actually saw a pretty significant increase in

20   2019 as compared to 2018.    But the vast

21   majority of the increase is actually during

22   the daytime hours when it is -- which makes

23   sense.

24            So the call volume between the hours
                                                          74

 1   of -- the extended hours of 5 o'clock and

 2   8 o'clock is comparatively low when we look

 3   at the numbers during the day.       But I think

 4   the good-news word is out that this call

 5   center exists, by virtue of the fact that the

 6   number of calls is increasing.

 7            And it doesn't appear, Senator, at

 8   this point in time, just based on the number

 9   volume, that we're not meeting the current

10   need for the after-hours calls.

11            SENATOR SERINO:    Really, a year isn't

12   enough time to get the message out there?

13   That's really disappointing that we wouldn't

14   be continuing that.

15            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    No, we will

16   be continuing.    Oh, we will absolutely be

17   continuing.

18            SENATOR SERINO:    Okay.   And keep

19   track.    And keep track.

20            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Yes.   Yeah.

21            SENATOR SERINO:    Oh, okay.   All right,

22   very good.

23            And I just wanted to echo some of my

24   colleagues' comments.      Assemblywoman Fahy,
                                                        75

 1   when she talked about the proposal to

 2   increase the funds for -- the flexible

 3   domestic violence funds -- I fully support

 4   this.   You know, right now the funds that are

 5   there are restrictive.    So this is a flexible

 6   funding.   And I know in our community we have

 7   DART, which is domestic abuse response teams

 8   that -- it's multidisciplinary crisis teams

 9   that work with the domestic advocates.       And

10   it's just been amazing.

11           So I fully support that.   I'm hoping

12   that that continues to go on.

13           And then the other issue was the

14   workforce.   I know Senator Savino had spoken

15   about that, and so did Assemblywoman Didi

16   Barrett.   And that is so important.   Our

17   vulnerable population, they get attached to

18   the people that are working with them, and

19   it's just such a shame.    We really need to

20   work on that.   And, you know, the Governor

21   fought very hard for the minimum wage

22   increase, but we just -- we need to do more.

23   Costs rise, and we have to be able to ensure

24   that we can keep these workers.
                                                      76

 1         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     I agree.

 2         SENATOR SERINO:    Thank you.   And I

 3   don't think I have anything else.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 5         We go to Assemblywoman Wright.

 6         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Good morning.

 7         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Good

 8   morning.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     I wanted to --

10   {inaudible; mic off.}

11         Good morning.     Can you hear me now?

12   Thank you very much.    I wanted to talk with

13   you first about the Family First Preventive

14   Services Act.   And we're anticipating

15   $75 million in new funding, but I don't see

16   anything dedicated to permanency efforts for

17   older foster kids in there, and the

18   explanation of where and how we're going to

19   be using the funds.

20         So I wanted to ask, what is it that

21   you're thinking about and how you would like

22   to see this and what you will be supporting

23   to support permanency for older foster

24   children?   First.
                                                       77

 1            And then I'd like to ask you to turn

 2   your attention to protective services for the

 3   aging.    We've had very long conversations, or

 4   I and your staff, regarding what and -- the

 5   manner in which protective services is able

 6   to enter the home and then they have a lack

 7   of transparency to report exactly what

 8   directed them to enter the home of and to

 9   begin the investigation when it becomes --

10   when it's a case of an aging person or that's

11   an alleged abuse.

12            So -- but there's been a tremendous

13   amount of resistance from your office in

14   examining the procedures that we use.    But I

15   think that this is one of the cases where we

16   have an old model that's not working and we

17   are not -- we're not giving enough

18   information to the person who is purportedly

19   being abused.    And oftentimes -- and in cases

20   that I've reported to you from my district --

21   we've had elders who have been what I would

22   say railroaded into a court process to prove

23   that they're not incapacitated.    And as we

24   all know, it's very difficult to prove the
                                                         78

 1   negative.

 2            So I'll give you both of those.

 3            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Sure.    So

 4   I'll start there, and we'll sort of work in

 5   reverse order, because I want to acknowledge

 6   what you've just raised.

 7            And, you know, Assemblywoman, I know

 8   that you are very concerned about that one

 9   case in particular, and we have done our

10   best, as we always do, to try and address

11   your questions.    And I'm sorry that you're

12   unsatisfied with that.   I think there are

13   times that despite our perspectives, we're

14   not always able to come to agreement.       But I

15   am more than happy to come back to the table

16   with you and to continue those conversations.

17            ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:   But you didn't

18   address what the pol -- the procedure and the

19   regulations that I'm asking you to talk

20   about.

21            So we have a regulation that allows

22   people to enter the home and to call for

23   emergency services if they deem it an

24   emergency.
                                                      79

 1         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Right.

 2         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:   However, under

 3   normal circumstances of an emergency, they

 4   are supposed to provide an affidavit to a

 5   judge, who expedites that case and gives them

 6   an order to enter the home.

 7         There's no procedure in place for them

 8   to explain why they want to call the police.

 9   That's what I asked for, and that's what I'm

10   asking you to address.

11         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I think that

12   conversation will take a lot of time for us

13   to continue to have, Assemblywoman.   But I am

14   happy to continue to have that with you.

15         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:   Okay.

16         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   So as for

17   the Family First Preventive Services Fund, so

18   we have $75 million appropriated in the

19   budget.   So we think up to $50 million of

20   that will go to New York City to help them

21   continue their services that they did under

22   the waiver.

23         The additional funds are designed, by

24   the federal statute, specifically to help
                                                     80

 1   states prepare for the transition to the

 2   Family First Act.   Which is really focused

 3   not as much on permanency, but it is focused

 4   on the recruitment of kinship foster families

 5   and foster families, because that's where we

 6   want to move more kids to in placement.

 7         However, you know, to your focus and

 8   your good question about what about

 9   permanency for older youth, what we do know

10   is when children in care are placed with

11   relatives, placed in kinship families, that

12   the likelihood of real permanency is better

13   for them.

14         And so that that's all part of our

15   hope and sort of march forward on Families

16   First, that we're going to have more older

17   teens -- instead of going into congregate

18   care, that we're going to build better

19   systems of support so that foster families

20   and kinship families can care for their

21   teenagers wherever possible so that they're

22   not going into congregate care where

23   sometimes permanency becomes more challenging

24   and we have kids aging out, right, when
                                                          81

 1   they're 18, leaving care without sort of a

 2   permanency resource and a place to live.

 3            ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:    Thank you.

 4            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 5            Senate?

 6            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator Gallivan.

 7            SENATOR GALLIVAN:   Thank you, Madam

 8   Chair.

 9            Good morning, Commissioner.

10            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Good

11   morning.

12            SENATOR GALLIVAN:   The Governor's

13   budget called for authorizing the transfer of

14   adolescent offenders from the Department of

15   Corrections and Community Supervision to

16   OCFS.    And part of the rationale -- among the

17   items the executive talked about is that this

18   will free up 750 beds, allowing for a prison

19   closure.    So I don't want to focus on the

20   DOCCS part of it; rather, the OCFS part of

21   it.

22            I have a whole host of questions.

23   Where will you put them?     How will you handle

24   it?   I didn't see any corresponding
                                                        82

 1   additional staff to handle it.    And the

 2   training, the security, all of those things.

 3   You can start anywhere.

 4         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    We're ready.

 5   So we have --

 6         SENATOR GALLIVAN:    Tell me how.     How

 7   are you ready?

 8         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    So just to

 9   say that in OCFS's current secure facilities,

10   about 87 percent of the young people we serve

11   are ages 16 and older.    So we already -- and

12   have for years -- served older youth.     And we

13   have, you know, youth who have serious

14   charges, longer sentences.

15         We have made -- and I would love for

16   you, Senator, I've offered you this before,

17   but now is another time for me to offer you

18   to come and tour an OCFS facility.   I think

19   you would be quite pleased with seeing the

20   investments that we have made in providing

21   college access to young people in our care,

22   doing vocational programs.    Our model is very

23   trauma-centered and focused for these young

24   people.
                                                       83

 1         And so I believe that this is a good

 2   proposal.    They're talking roughly about less

 3   than 40 young people who are in the DOCCS

 4   system.     I think the numbers of women are

 5   extremely low; I think there's one woman.

 6         We have available capacity today

 7   within OCFS's secure facilities and enough

 8   funding for adequate staffing to transfer

 9   these youth in -- again, as the Article VII

10   proposal calls for, a planful transition

11   process.

12         So I feel -- I've had numerous

13   conversations with Commissioner Annucci.

14   We've been great partners on Raise the Age.

15   I feel confident in my system that we are

16   more than well-equipped to serve these kids.

17   And I believe what we have built up in our

18   youth justice system over the past decade at

19   OCFS can really achieve better outcomes for

20   those young people when they leave care.

21         SENATOR GALLIVAN:     So DOCCS had

22   originally planned for the male population to

23   be -- to have essentially an east and a west,

24   two separate facilities, I believe, for them.
                                                           84

 1   How would you -- so you say you have the

 2   capacity.   Would they be going to facilities

 3   across the state, these adolescent offenders,

 4   or are you focused on one or two geographic

 5   areas of the state?

 6         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    We have

 7   capacity at a number of my secure facilities.

 8   So one of the first things that we would do

 9   with DOCCS is figure out where is home for

10   the 30-plus young people that they have.        And

11   we would do whatever we can with our existing

12   capacity, right, to try and position young

13   people in the transfer to sort of be as close

14   to their homes as possible.

15         Because one of the other elements of

16   our work in youth justice is a strong

17   emphasis on family engagement and after-care

18   services.   So that would be the ideal plan.

19   And as I said, Senator, with our current

20   available capacity at OCFS, I think we can

21   absolutely achieve that.

22         SENATOR GALLIVAN:    The time is now to

23   follow up on that.

24         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Right.    I
                                                     85

 1   hope you'll come to visit.

 2         SENATOR GALLIVAN:   It simply has been

 3   scheduling rather lack of desire.   But I

 4   think it's more than appropriate now.

 5         Thank you.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Assembly.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 8   Assemblywoman Dickens.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN DICKENS:    Thank you,

10   Madam Chair.

11         And thank you, Commissioner, for your

12   testimony and being here this morning and the

13   work that you've done, which has been great.

14         However, I do want to piggyback on my

15   colleague Assemblymember Wright's question

16   about the elder abuse, in that frequently

17   particularly single women, seniors -- the

18   Department of Aging focuses on them because

19   there's no one to really care for them,

20   there's no relative, no children, no husband,

21   no family -- they are removed out of the home

22   once they start having difficulty and then

23   their homes are put up for sale.

24         But if there is a small mortgage --
                                                      86

 1   because frequently those homes have been paid

 2   for.   But if there is a mortgage left on

 3   there, the banks are complicit in this, in

 4   that the house is sold and then the money is

 5   not -- none of the money is designated even

 6   for them to have burial, let alone any

 7   additional money.    The money is taken by the

 8   Department of Aging.

 9          So I'd like you to address that.

10   That's number one.

11          The second thing is -- and this is

12   rather short.   In the Domestic Violence Task

13   Force -- and I commend you for being the

14   cochair for that.    Domestic violence cases,

15   frequently the children are put into foster

16   care if it's designated that the mother is

17   unable to protect the child.    And I see here

18   that, for instance, there's been a proposal

19   in the Executive Budget to decrease, for

20   instance, kinship care by $2 million and the

21   Youth Development Program by $1.5 million,

22   settlement houses, 2.45, and Safe Harbour,

23   3 million.   That could significantly impact

24   particularly the kinship care on the care
                                                     87

 1   that the youth can receive from family

 2   members that may need the additional help.

 3         In addition, because of the necessity

 4   for mental health, I see that also for a

 5   union professional development, that there is

 6   a proposal in the Executive Budget that

 7   although 4.3 million is there for childcare,

 8   that it represents a decrease of 4.3 million

 9   for FY '19-'20 for state support for

10   professional development and quality

11   enhancement activities.

12         Can you give me some answers to that,

13   please.   Because -- and the other thing is

14   that frequently in certain communities it's a

15   severe undercount in the number of domestic

16   violence cases because culturally they don't

17   make the report.   So the numbers that we see

18   are really not the correct numbers.

19         Thank you.

20         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Yeah, of

21   course.

22         So when you began your comments, you

23   described something that sounds very alarming

24   about some of the patterns that you may be
                                                       88

 1   seeing in your district.   I would like us to

 2   follow up, Assemblywoman, and perhaps bring

 3   our commissioner for the Office of Aging just

 4   to talk about some of those case-specific

 5   scenarios and find out what's really going on

 6   there.

 7            So the cut that you referenced is with

 8   respect to contracts that we have had with

 9   our partners at UFT and CSEA for professional

10   development and grant programs.    And they are

11   proposed, as you said, for a reduction.   And

12   I want to say that the work that they've done

13   is very valuable.    In fact, when you look at,

14   though, the amount of money that has been in

15   the contracts versus the amount of money that

16   actually has been spent in the contracts,

17   there's been a lot of underspending of those

18   contracts.

19            And so I think what our sense is is

20   after having experience with these contracts

21   for a number of years now, that what we

22   believe should remain in the budget actually

23   more accurately reflects what the right

24   spending level is for those programs.
                                                         89

 1            The second thing I would say is even

 2   with the proposed funding reduction that

 3   we're talking about, that based upon the

 4   current funding that is still left from

 5   previous contracts, that both UFT and CSEA

 6   should be able to continue the work they're

 7   doing with their existing funds through the

 8   end of 2021.

 9            ASSEMBLYWOMAN DICKENS:    All right.

10   Well, thank you so much.   Because that

11   includes mental health, and that's extremely

12   important for women of domestic violence

13   families and their children.      So thank you so

14   much.

15            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Thank you.

16            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Senate?

17            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.   So

18   this isn't a question for you to answer

19   today, but hopefully you and your people can

20   put together a chart for us.

21            It seems to me that there is a pattern

22   over -- I'm going to say let's go back eight

23   years.    We keep shifting more and more of the

24   cost for human services, children's
                                                      90

 1   services -- the same question will be for

 2   OTDA afterwards, so if they're here

 3   listening, I'd like a chart that shows X

 4   program that's within your agency, what

 5   amount did you spend each year, what percent

 6   was state responsibility, what percent did

 7   you send over to the localities.

 8         Because I'm very concerned, and I

 9   think many of us are, that we keep balancing

10   our budget by shifting the cost

11   responsibilities to the localities.   We cut

12   our aid continuing to them.   We cut our local

13   share, we tell them they have to cap what

14   they can tax themselves.

15         And I think we maybe walk through life

16   with the illusion that as long as it's

17   getting paid for somewhere, it's getting

18   taken care of.   But you and I both know

19   that's not how life works.    The localities

20   then find themselves unable to keep up with

21   the increased costs on themselves, so they

22   end up not delivering on the programs that we

23   all think are the right programs, or having

24   to cut something else that isn't as extreme a
                                                           91

 1   mandate for them, which also does longer-term

 2   harm.

 3           So that's all I'm asking for.        It's a

 4   chart showing the amount change and the

 5   percent of change of what is state and what

 6   gets passed on to the localities for your

 7   full budget.

 8           OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Thank you.

 9   I have your request, Senator.

10           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

11           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

12   Assemblywoman Jaffee for five minutes.

13           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Thank you,

14   Commissioner.   I wanted to follow up on

15   something that I think is really essential in

16   the conversation.   In my discussion with a

17   variety of childcare leaders throughout the

18   state, an issue of great concern has been

19   availability of the workers, the childcare

20   workers, who are at the levels of

21   professional development that is so essential

22   in terms of their education and preparation.

23           So there's -- the difficulty is often

24   the limited amount of funding that can be
                                                     92

 1   provided to the childcare program limits

 2   their ability to be able to provide the

 3   salary for the workers that encourages

 4   workers to come into the childcare program,

 5   that encourages them to maintain those

 6   programs after they've gone to college and

 7   gotten that level of education at that cost,

 8   and too many, as have been noted, move on to

 9   other levels of jobs.

10         And so there has been a great deal of

11   struggle within the childcare programs on

12   maintaining the programs at a level that is

13   so essential in terms of the workers who are

14   educated in the areas that are absolutely,

15   you know, needed and required for these

16   programs.

17         And so it truly is a major issue that

18   we need to focus on in terms of providing

19   more state funding for our programs so that

20   they can then assure that there is the level

21   of academic ability of these workers and then

22   attracting workers at salary levels that

23   maintain them.

24         So that really -- these are very real
                                                        93

 1   issues.    As well as -- well, the task force

 2   that I created that we're discussing, maybe

 3   we can sit down with the task force and talk

 4   about their thoughts about this issue as

 5   well.    Because it really is something that

 6   has come up over and over again in my

 7   conversation with childcare programs in a

 8   variety of areas.

 9            So it's something that we need to move

10   forward with to assure that there are enough

11   childcare providers and then, within that

12   context, the workers are those that have that

13   education level that is so essential.

14            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   I can assure

15   you, Assemblywoman, that what you just

16   articulated is among the top-line issues and

17   concerns being discussed and brought forward

18   as part of the task force, for sure.

19            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:   So we will --

20   can sit together, because it's something that

21   we really need to move forward and assure

22   that we are responding to this very real

23   issue.    So thank you.

24            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Thank you.
                                                        94

 1   We'll go to Assemblyman Ra for a question.

 2          ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Good morning.

 3          OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Good

 4   morning.

 5          ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Thank you.     I just

 6   had a question about the Pay for Success

 7   program that had been launched a few years

 8   ago.   There's been, you know, appropriations

 9   made for this.    Is that operating?    Or where

10   are we with regard to that program?     Or is

11   that more OTDA?

12          OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:   Yeah, that's

13   not in my agency budget.   I think

14   Commissioner Hein and his staff can better

15   answer your question, Assemblyman.

16          ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Okay, thank you.

17          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    So --

18   Commissioner, so I have a few questions.     And

19   we'll start with a couple that Assemblyman

20   Hevesi didn't have a chance to get to.

21          So the federal Family First Transition

22   Act also includes -- there's been some

23   discussion about that already -- resources

24   for jurisdictions who are transitioning off
                                                          95

 1   Title IV-E waivers.     And New York City was

 2   the only jurisdiction to have the waiver.       So

 3   it's about $50 million that we do for

 4   New York City.   So I think we just want to

 5   make sure and clarify that that money will be

 6   for New York City, as intended by the federal

 7   government.

 8         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Yes.   So the

 9   answer is yes.   The federal bill on that is

10   very specific about what portion of the

11   funding, of the total funding pool has to be

12   directed toward those communities who had a

13   waiver.   And by extension, given that ACS was

14   the only community that participated in the

15   waiver, that money will be directed to ACS.

16         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     And how is the

17   state planning to use the 25 million from the

18   federal Family First Transition Act?

19         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Yeah, so we

20   expect that -- I don't know that it's going

21   to be 25 million, but I think we think it's

22   around $21.4 million.

23         And as I described earlier, we have

24   not made decisions yet about how.    It's a
                                                       96

 1   one-time infusion of dollars.   It's not a lot

 2   of money when you look at everything we have

 3   to do between now and September of 2021 to

 4   adequately prepare for it.

 5         But it will absolutely -- you know,

 6   Congress intended this money to support

 7   states' efforts to make the transition.   So

 8   again, looking at further efforts to support

 9   kinship families, further efforts to recruit

10   and support foster families.    We're going to

11   have to think about how do we prepare

12   independent assessors, how do we allow

13   agencies who might be interested in applying

14   to be a QRTP but don't have an accreditation.

15   There are a lot of things sort of on a list

16   for us to take into consideration, you know,

17   given what I think is a welcome but

18   relatively modest pool of money, all things

19   considered.

20         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Then a question

21   about -- that really goes -- that is both to

22   you and I guess as it relates to OTDA also --

23   the child welfare services funding stream has

24   historically been funded with $635 million.
                                                      97

 1   The Executive proposes a $25 million

 2   reduction and would require an additional

 3   25 million of the FFFS to be used for child

 4   welfare, which seems to leave that whole.

 5            But there's a question that the city

 6   has used -- historically used some of that

 7   funding for senior centers.      So I guess by

 8   putting the -- is there a way to assure that

 9   both the children and seniors remain whole?

10            OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    So,

11   Assemblywoman Weinstein, I -- and again, I

12   will defer to my friends at OTDA who are more

13   expert than I on it.   So I think the funding

14   stream that you're referring to for the

15   senior centers in New York City was Title XX

16   funds.    And I don't believe that that is on

17   the table or impacted by the FFFS.

18            But if I am wrong, Commissioner Hein

19   and his exec dep will tell me.

20            But there is no question that it will

21   require -- it will have a $25 million impact,

22   assuming that the counties are spending in

23   the way that they have before.

24            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    And then a
                                                      98

 1   question -- several years ago, actually based

 2   on some legislation that Senator Savino and I

 3   had sponsored, we raised the age for runaway

 4   and homeless youth that could be served up to

 5   age 21.   And we're wondering if these youth

 6   are being served.   Now that there's the

 7   authority, is the funding stream sufficient

 8   to serve them?   And can you just give some

 9   feedback on what's happened since we made

10   that change.

11         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    Well, you're

12   not giving yourselves enough credit, because

13   you actually got it raised to 24.

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Okay.   Oh,

15   right, from 21 to 24.   You're right, yes.

16         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:    So since

17   that was passed, there are about 14 counties,

18   including New York City, who have opted in to

19   take advantage of that expansion.   There are

20   a small number of programs that have actually

21   been certified to date to serve the older

22   population.

23         So I know in New York City they did a

24   separate procurement.   I believe they have
                                                        99

 1   four programs in the city who are able to

 2   serve the older youth.    In upstate, I believe

 3   there are two programs.    And I understand

 4   that there are also several others in the

 5   state that are considering taking advantage

 6   of the option.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Great.     And I

 8   was wondering, last year we had some

 9   discussion when you were here about changes

10   to -- the proposed changes based on a federal

11   guidance related -- in relation to domestic

12   violence programs, relating to public

13   assistance.

14         And I just wonder if we can get an

15   update on how that change is working without

16   the requirement to have to apply for public

17   assistance.   Have programs reported decreases

18   in funding as a result?    And what findings

19   did -- I assume the task force looked at this

20   also -- did the task force make?

21         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Yeah,

22   absolutely.

23         So, you know, as you may recall, when

24   that change was made and there was a lot of
                                                         100

 1   concern about it, we committed to keeping a

 2   careful watch on sort of what was the

 3   downstream impact of that.

 4         And we meet regularly with NYSCADV --

 5   both OCFS and they are a valued member of the

 6   DV Task Force.   So we have not heard of any

 7   significant concerns.   And had not heard

 8   anything from any local department of social

 9   services, of course, concerned that it

10   would -- you know, by not requiring them to

11   apply for public assistance, you know, create

12   other challenges.

13         I will say to you just last week I met

14   with all of the local district commissioners

15   for their annual conference, and there were a

16   couple of smaller counties that did say to me

17   that they've seen a bit of an increase.      That

18   was the first time after over a year I had

19   heard that.   So we are following up, as we

20   promised we would, you know, with those

21   counties to see really what the impact was,

22   because that was our commitment, that we were

23   going to be keeping an eye on that.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Great.    I
                                                      101

 1   believe that that is the end of questions

 2   from the members.     I know there are a few

 3   items that you'll get back to us on that

 4   there wasn't time to address.    And thank you

 5   so much for being here today, Commissioner.

 6         OCFS COMMISSIONER POOLE:     Thank you

 7   all very much.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Next we'll be

 9   hearing from the New York State Office of

10   Temporary and Disability Assistance, Michael

11   Hein, commissioner.

12         Just letting everybody -- a minute to

13   let everybody settle down.

14         (Pause.)

15         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Okay,

16   Commissioner Hein, you're welcome to --

17   welcome, and please begin.

18         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Thank you

19   very much.

20         Good morning, Chairpersons Krueger,

21   Weinstein, Persaud and Hevesi, as well as the

22   other esteemed members of the New York State

23   Legislature.   I am Mike Hein, the

24   commissioner of the Office of Temporary and
                                                        102

 1   Disability Assistance, and it is my honor to

 2   appear before you today to discuss the

 3   2021 Executive Budget and the important work

 4   of our agency.

 5         OTDA's core mission is to help

 6   vulnerable New Yorkers by ensuring essential

 7   services for families and individuals that

 8   help them advance economically by providing

 9   meaningful opportunities for stable

10   employment, better access to affordable

11   housing, and quality nutrition for both

12   themselves and their families.

13         In addition, our agency administers

14   vital programs for those temporarily unable

15   to work, as well as for many working families

16   who simply struggle to make ends meet.     These

17   programs create much-needed housing and

18   provide employment services, healthy food as

19   well as heating assistance.   We also inspect

20   homeless shelters to improve safety and

21   security, make critical disability

22   determinations that dramatically improve

23   people's lives, provide child support

24   services, as well as assist refugees and
                                                     103

 1   immigrants that come to New York in search of

 2   the American dream.

 3          And this year we are extremely pleased

 4   that while the Executive Budget addresses

 5   serious fiscal concerns, it continues the

 6   Governor's $20 billion investment in

 7   affordable housing, which is creating or

 8   preserving more than 100,000 units of

 9   affordable housing and 6,000 units of

10   supportive housing over five years.

11          All of these efforts share a common

12   goal -- and that is to help individuals and

13   families meet immediate, essential needs

14   while supporting their efforts to achieve

15   lasting economic security.

16          Building on this initiative, the

17   budget makes a major new investment in the

18   Homeless Housing and Assistance Program, or

19   HHAP, by actually doubling the funding from

20   $64 million to $128 million, while investing

21   $5 million for projects specifically designed

22   to assist homeless veterans.

23          HHAP provides pivotal capital grants

24   and loans to expand and improve the supply of
                                                       104

 1   permanent supportive, transitional and

 2   emergency housing for individuals

 3   experiencing homelessness.

 4         This funding expansion will help a

 5   wide range of populations, including those

 6   experiencing mental illness, and also

 7   substance use disorder, victims of domestic

 8   violence, youth, as well as our veterans.

 9         Under Governor Cuomo's leadership,

10   New York has also made a strong commitment to

11   fighting hunger and ending food insecurity.

12   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

13   has been a vital part of that work.    SNAP can

14   provide more than $6,000 a year for a typical

15   household, making it significantly easier to

16   feed a family and make ends meet.

17         Currently, there are roughly

18   1.5 million households in New York, totaling

19   nearly 2.6 million people, receiving

20   approximately $360 million in SNAP benefits

21   each month.

22         In this year's State of the State, the

23   Governor announced plans to further expand

24   access to SNAP for eligible community college
                                                     105

 1   students, ensuring more students receive

 2   essential nutrition assistance as they work

 3   towards a college degree or certificate and a

 4   better future for themselves and their

 5   families.

 6         And to reach even more people, OTDA

 7   has worked with the Department of Health and

 8   NY State of Health so that people who are

 9   eligible for Medicaid can quickly opt in to

10   receive information about SNAP and over

11   100,000 applicants have already done so.

12         On another positive note, the

13   Executive Budget increases funding for the

14   very successful Summer Youth Employment

15   Program, providing $45 million to help

16   approximately 19,000 young people from

17   low-income families get a job this summer.

18   This program helps youth develop relevant

19   skills that can lead to improved school

20   performance, better positioning them for

21   success in the future.

22         The Executive Budget also continues

23   New York State's commitment to OTDA's other

24   core programs.   This includes resources to
                                                    106

 1   fund the agency's child support program,

 2   which collected more than $1.8 billion last

 3   year on behalf of nearly 800,000 families.

 4         As you know, child support is an

 5   important source of income that helps

 6   families achieve financial stability.   It

 7   reduces childhood poverty and, in turn,

 8   childhood trauma.

 9         OTDA also oversees the federally

10   funded Home Energy Assistance Program that

11   helped nearly 1.5 million households heat

12   their homes last winter and reduce energy

13   needs through energy-efficiency investments.

14         This winter, HEAP again allows for a

15   maximum regular benefit of up to $726, which

16   is especially helpful for low-income

17   households that pay a higher percentage of

18   their income towards energy costs.

19         Senators and Assemblymembers, like

20   you, we at OTDA fully recognize the

21   importance and gravity of the work we are

22   committed to and the lives we touch in the

23   process.   In partnership with the Governor

24   and the State Legislature, through every
                                                         107

 1   program that we administer, we strive to

 2   empower vulnerable New Yorkers to improve

 3   their financial security and household

 4   stability in support of stronger individuals,

 5   families, and communities all across our

 6   state.

 7            I want to thank you for the

 8   opportunity to appear before you today, and I

 9   welcome your comments and questions.

10            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to the

11   chair of our Social Services Committee,

12   Assemblyman Hevesi.

13            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     Thank you,

14   Chairwoman.

15            Good morning, Commissioner.    How are

16   you, sir?

17            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Good morning.

18   Good.

19            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     Thank you for

20   coming, and thank you for all of the work

21   that you and your staff -- and I see some of

22   them here, Ms. Guinn, Ms. West and the

23   rest -- thank you for all the work that you

24   guys do at the staff level.
                                                        108

 1         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Thank you.

 2         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     I know you do

 3   good work under difficult circumstances.      It

 4   is appreciated.

 5         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Thank you.

 6         ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     I am going to

 7   focus on one topic only today.    It's -- we've

 8   talked offline about this, and it will be a

 9   little out of left field.    Normally people

10   would expect me to talk about homelessness, I

11   am not going to -- with the exception to say

12   I am going to leave that alone because I

13   believe that the big dogs at the mother ship

14   are going to be handling that.    That includes

15   both chairs of Ways and Means and the

16   Speaker; they are fully engaged now -- and I

17   believe the Majority Leader as well -- and

18   they will be handling the issue of

19   homelessness.   So I'm going to move on.

20         The one issue I want to talk to you

21   today -- and I need your help, frankly -- is

22   human trafficking.   And I've got to set the

23   stage for my colleagues just so we all have a

24   sense of how we got there.
                                                        109

 1            So a couple of years ago the Assembly

 2   held a hearing about human trafficking and

 3   identified that the primary need for

 4   trafficking victims is you've got to get them

 5   out of the abusive environments, you've got

 6   to get them safe houses.    And we put in a

 7   bill, the bill was passed unanimously by both

 8   houses -- that means every one of my

 9   colleagues voted for it -- and it was a nice

10   victory, and the law requires -- and this is

11   my Bernie Sanders moment:      "I wrote the damn

12   bill."    So --

13            (Laughter.)

14            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:    So the bill says

15   that for every trafficking victim in New York

16   State, there will be culturally competent

17   short-term and long-term safe houses --

18   again, to take these victims of human

19   trafficking out of the abusive environments

20   so they don't have to -- and I don't want to

21   overstate this, but we're talking about

22   predominantly women who are being sexually

23   abused, raped, beaten, branded, drugged, the

24   worst horrible abuses.   And every night that
                                                        110

 1   we in government are not providing those

 2   actual safe houses I believe is our problem.

 3           So I'd like to work with you.     I just

 4   need a couple of pieces of information about

 5   the -- how we fill that need.     Okay?   So the

 6   first question for you is, how many certified

 7   human trafficking victims are there -- or

 8   survivors, I shouldn't say victims, survivors

 9   in New York State?

10           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Well, that

11   question is two parts.   One is -- I have the

12   question of how many we are serving.

13           ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   Mm-hmm.

14           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    And then the

15   size and scope of the problem.

16           ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   Great.

17           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    I think

18   there's no question that the size and scope

19   of the problem, we are serving a fraction of

20   that.   And that is consistent with what's

21   happening all across the country.      There is

22   an enormous challenge bringing people forward

23   and making sure that we're able to provide

24   them services.
                                                     111

 1         So there's a huge outreach effort

 2   going on right now.     The legislature did a

 3   great thing when it changed the law and made

 4   sure that we could supply services for

 5   individuals regardless of their immigration

 6   status, which was a critically important

 7   component.

 8         There's also a reality that we should

 9   talk about, and that is that the numbers that

10   we saw going from '15 to '16 were a

11   significant increase -- a 150 percent

12   increase.    And then what we saw was a

13   leveling.    And the challenge that we saw at

14   that point, that we clearly are seeing right

15   now is while we are seeing more individuals

16   who are documented, we are seeing a

17   significant drop-off in people who are

18   undocumented, victims who are willing to come

19   forward, because they're concerned about the

20   net outcome for them.

21         And so that's a component of this

22   process.    Again, the number that we are

23   actually serving is consistent across the

24   board, it's about 288 individuals at this
                                                        112

 1   point.

 2            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   Two-eighty-eight.

 3            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Correct.

 4            Now, the question about housing is a

 5   really important one.    And there might be a

 6   nuanced distinction here, but I think it's

 7   important that we have the conversation and

 8   we appreciate the discussion.

 9            To provide this service across the

10   entire state, we partner with six incredibly

11   strong not-for-profits.    And in our

12   conversations with them what they have made

13   very clear to us is they are able to provide

14   housing to all who need housing -- and that

15   is, again, all who will accept assistance in

16   providing housing, because not everyone that

17   comes forward will accept housing assistance.

18   But the ones that do, and there's a large

19   percentage of them that will, we provide the

20   entire myriad of services to them, whether

21   that be permanent housing, temporary housing,

22   obviously, or emergency housing as well.

23            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   Okay.   So first,

24   thank you for the 288 number, that's helpful.
                                                      113

 1   And again, you know, this will wind up being

 2   a range, it always is, when you're trying to

 3   budget.

 4          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Sure.

 5          ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   And we have

 6   corresponded -- my colleagues don't know

 7   this, but we have corresponded about this,

 8   and I know that we rely heavily on -- I

 9   thought it was five RHTPs, the regional --

10          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   We've added

11   another one.

12          ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   You added another

13   one?

14          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Yes.

15          ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:   Okay, great.

16          I know we rely on them to make

17   determinations about what housing needs to be

18   provided and what services need to be

19   provided, but under the law that we just

20   passed, all of them are entitled to housing.

21   So that's number one.

22          Number two, the temporary -- some of

23   the housing methodologies that you had

24   mentioned in your letter -- housing
                                                     114

 1   methodologies sounds weird.   The types of

 2   housing that you had mentioned in your letter

 3   include domestic violence shelters, temporary

 4   shelters and others.   None of those -- and

 5   this is an important point that we need to

 6   agree on -- none of those comply with the

 7   law.

 8          Domestic violence shelters do not

 9   provide the same services as is now required

10   by -- for safe houses and long-term houses.

11   Neither does temporary housing.   They may

12   provide some, and I'm open to the idea that

13   some of the housing could be in compliance.

14   But as a general principle, the answer is we

15   are no longer in compliance with the law.

16          So I'm going to assume, in the absence

17   of other information from you -- and we'll

18   share and work on this together --

19          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sure.

20          ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:    -- that none of

21   the 288 that we're supposed to be serving are

22   in housing that complies with the law that we

23   just passed.

24          And as such, it is now our job as the
                                                        115

 1   Legislature and the Executive to figure out,

 2   okay, you have 288 certified victims, they

 3   are all legally entitled to housing, the

 4   housing is supposed to have a number of

 5   components, now we've got a budget for it.

 6   So how are we going to do that?   How much

 7   capital money is that going to take, how much

 8   operational money is that going to take?     And

 9   I would like to get those answers and work

10   with you in time for this budget.

11         My only concern is that we don't come

12   to an agreement on what those numbers are in

13   time to act this year, and then we would have

14   to wait another budget cycle.   And as you and

15   I both know, and I'm sure we agree, the

16   victims of human trafficking don't have

17   another year to wait for us to get our act

18   together and get the right housing.

19         So I would like to -- thank you for

20   the 288 number, that's very helpful as a

21   baseline for our Ways and Means staff.     We

22   would like to work with you on maybe in the

23   Governor's 21-day amendments -- and certainly

24   in our Senate and Assembly one-houses --
                                                            116

 1   coming back with a program to comply with the

 2   law to create and build, if need be,

 3   culturally competent, short-term and

 4   long-term safe houses.      So I look forward to

 5   working with you on that, sir.

 6            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Thank you.

 7            ASSEMBLYMAN HEVESI:     Thank you very

 8   much, Commissioner.

 9            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.     We

10   go to the Senate.

11            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.   The

12   chair of Social Services, Roxanne Persaud.

13            SENATOR PERSAUD:    Good morning.

14            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Good morning.

15            SENATOR PERSAUD:    Thank you,

16   Commissioner, for being here.

17            And my mic just doesn't want to work

18   today.    Can you hear me now?    Great.

19            I'm going to start with the Summer

20   Youth Employment Program.      I know you were

21   touting the success of that program.       Why is

22   it, then, that we're not adding additional

23   slots for kids across the state?       You know,

24   we're increasing the budget by a million
                                                       117

 1   dollars; it's only covering the cost of

 2   wages.    Why aren't we adding additional

 3   slots?

 4            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Again, we're

 5   very pleased at, again, the success that

 6   we're seeing.    We're seeing it across the

 7   entire state, and that's one of the real

 8   wonderful parts about it.    That's what makes

 9   it such a success, it works upstate, it works

10   downstate, it works across the spectrum.

11            It really comes down to this is a

12   conversation in the context of a larger

13   budget question.    These are difficult

14   financial years, and we firmly -- we're

15   committed to making sure that we move forward

16   and continue what we had.     And obviously we

17   made accommodations for the additional rate.

18            SENATOR PERSAUD:   But wouldn't it be

19   in our best interests to ensure that those

20   kids who are coming from the vulnerable

21   communities are actually being employed by

22   the Summer Youth Program?

23            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Again, I

24   understand the question.    I'm very concerned
                                                          118

 1   about making sure that we retain the funding

 2   that we're talking about here.       It is a

 3   $45 million expenditure.    And we are very

 4   pleased about it, and we know that we will be

 5   serving 19,000 youth in this process.

 6          But I understand your question.          I

 7   think it really comes down to -- it was a

 8   budgetary question.

 9          SENATOR PERSAUD:     Okay.    Now, my

10   colleague spoke about the homelessness issue.

11   And, you know, we don't want to belabor the

12   questions about homelessness.       But have we --

13   in 2018 when we added the $50 million to the

14   pilot program for HSS, have we looked at the

15   cost, you know, how much it's really costing

16   us?   And are we intending to add additional

17   counties to that program?

18           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      To the pilot

19   program?

20          SENATOR PERSAUD:    Mm-hmm.

21          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       Maybe we

22   should talk a little bit and get kind of an

23   update on where we stand at this point.

24          Currently where we stand in that is
                                                     119

 1   that Monroe County has been approved, and

 2   they are beginning that operational side in

 3   Rochester.   And then what we expect in our

 4   conversations with New York and where we're

 5   at is that New York will be operational by

 6   June of this year.   And obviously we're

 7   anxiously awaiting the outcomes of that.

 8   That's again a significant commitment and I'm

 9   looking forward to seeing what the results

10   are.

11           But no, at this point there hasn't

12   been a conversation about adding additional

13   cities to that.

14           SENATOR PERSAUD:   Okay.    You know,

15   every day we hear about the homelessness

16   crisis across our state.    We look -- you

17   know, I'm from New York City.      We see it

18   every day.

19           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.

20           SENATOR PERSAUD:   And we -- I'm not

21   sure when we'll get a handle on that

22   situation.   And there is a need for us to do

23   more.   And, you know, if we have to add more

24   counties to HSS -- we have to do something.
                                                      120

 1   We need to get people off the streets.   No

 2   one across the State of New York should be

 3   living on the streets in the conditions that

 4   they are living in.

 5         You know, this morning I turned on the

 6   television and I am hearing talks about, you

 7   know, the possibility of us spending money to

 8   keep a football team in New York State -- but

 9   we have people living on the streets.    Those

10   are the kinds of things -- we have to

11   understand which is more important.   People

12   living on the streets of New York City and

13   New York State is not acceptable.   We have to

14   do more on that.

15         You know, we've had these

16   conversations, and I really appreciate you

17   coming in and us having these conversations

18   so that we can really fight for the people

19   across the state who are most in need.

20         Can you tell us about, you know, the

21   SNAP benefits and what the federal government

22   authorization is going to do to the

23   population of New York State, the SNAP

24   population?
                                                      121

 1          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sure.    I

 2   mean, what you're talking about is some of

 3   the rule changes associated with SNAP?

 4          SENATOR PERSAUD:    The rule changes,

 5   yes.   Mm-hmm.

 6          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Well, again,

 7   there was a recent Supreme Court ruling that

 8   just came down on the {inaudible} --

 9          SENATOR PERSAUD:    An appellate --

10          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    -- area of

11   that, many of us know.

12          SENATOR PERSAUD:    Yup.

13          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    It removed a

14   stay that was in place, and so now that rule

15   has taken effect.

16          SENATOR PERSAUD:    Yup.

17          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    For us, it

18   has been -- we've been working in advance of

19   that, obviously.    And to us it's about

20   reducing the size of the pool of individuals

21   who would be impacted by this rule change.

22          Obviously early on when the rule

23   change first came out, we put out comments on

24   that that were very focused against it, as
                                                       122

 1   did many other people -- actually, 100,000

 2   comments plus, the vast majority against.

 3   The unfortunate truth is not only did they

 4   move forward with it, we think they've

 5   actually made it worse.

 6         And so the reality of this process is

 7   that it will be in effect as of April 1st of

 8   this year.   Again, our role is to minimize

 9   the negative impact in that situation.    So we

10   look at the pool of individuals that are

11   affected, and we want to make sure that their

12   status hasn't changed, that there aren't some

13   other mitigating factors that would remove

14   them from that pool.

15         Again, so we're in the process of

16   trying to reduce that with all of the

17   districts.   And then, at that point, working

18   more with the districts to make sure that all

19   of the necessary training and assistance is

20   available for them so that individuals aren't

21   impacted.    So there's an aggressive effort to

22   be able to help ensure that that rule change,

23   when it takes effect on April 1st, either

24   impacts the fewest amount of people or has no
                                                       123

 1   impact in New York, and that's the goal.

 2           SENATOR PERSAUD:   And you've allocated

 3   funding -- what is the cost to the state so

 4   far, based on your calculations?

 5           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Well, again,

 6   we work extensively with the districts on a

 7   daily basis, and those costs are rolled into

 8   OTDA's normal budget.

 9           SENATOR PERSAUD:   This is over 100,000

10   people we're talking about that's in that

11   pool.

12           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Correct.   We

13   think that at this point it's 113,000 people

14   in that pool.

15           SENATOR PERSAUD:   Thirteen thousand?

16           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   One hundred

17   and thirteen thousand.

18           SENATOR PERSAUD:   Interesting.

19           The cost shift to New York City, can

20   you talk about that?    Why are we -- you know,

21   we only last year shifted additional costs to

22   New York City, and right at -- again, we're

23   shifting it more.   Why is that necessary?

24           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Well, I think
                                                       124

 1   it's important that we talk about really

 2   where this is at.   And I think this is a

 3   challenging public policy conversation that

 4   needs to take place.

 5           When we talk about where that 10 and

 6   now 15 percent proposal would come from, it

 7   really is directly tied to the escalation in

 8   Family Assistance, Family Assistance dollars.

 9   It's the rate of increase associated with

10   that.

11           And the rate of increase isn't going

12   up commensurate with cost of living, it isn't

13   going up commensurate with caseloads, it's

14   going up, in our most recent calculations,

15   almost quadruple anywhere else in the state.

16   And so it is our position that it's not

17   unreasonable for New York City to share in

18   that process as we look to try to identify

19   ways to be able to control those costs and

20   control the rate of increase.

21           SENATOR PERSAUD:   But New York City is

22   sharing the burden of the increase, the

23   highest --

24           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   It's an
                                                        125

 1   eight -- it's an eight -- with Family

 2   Assistance we're still paying 85 percent in

 3   this proposal.

 4         SENATOR PERSAUD:   Okay.     Thank you.

 5         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Again, I

 6   understand the position and I understand the

 7   question.   And I understand it can be

 8   controversial.   But I also -- again, it's not

 9   an unreasonable thing to start to examine

10   that escalation in cost that goes to, again,

11   near quadruple anywhere else in the state.

12         SENATOR PERSAUD:   Quadruple.    Okay.

13         And my final -- the Empire State

14   Poverty Reduction Initiative.    Have all the

15   municipalities developed their plans as yet?

16   And what is the status of the implementation

17   plans across the municipalities?

18         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.   Again,

19   a wonderful innovative way of being able to

20   look across the entire state to try to

21   develop different strategies that were really

22   grassroots-driven.   That's phase -- Phase 1

23   really was working with the individual -- 16

24   individual communities on strategies that
                                                     126

 1   they believed could be helpful in reducing

 2   poverty in their particular area, with a

 3   respect for what works in one location may

 4   not work in another.

 5         That really was Phase 1.   Phase 2 was

 6   the implementation and operationalizing of

 7   those plans, which has taken place now and is

 8   taking place as we speak.

 9         The next phase is -- we expect that

10   there will be a full recommendation made

11   going into next year's budget based off of

12   those, on things that we have seen that have

13   worked -- because again, it is designed in

14   many ways to be an incubator.   So to be able

15   to identify ways and programs that we think

16   should be expanded throughout the state.

17         SENATOR PERSAUD:   Okay, quickly, the

18   $40 million reduction from the Flex Fund for

19   Family Services, can you talk about that?

20   And is there really a need for concern about

21   that, the cost of that shift?

22         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    I think --

23   I'm always a big believer in having these

24   conversations in a very frank way.   There's
                                                        127

 1   no question there's a $25 million positive

 2   impact to the state budget.

 3          That said, in that action we firmly

 4   believe that it also prioritizes child

 5   welfare, that we all believe is critically

 6   important in that fund.   We also believe that

 7   we'll be able to work -- {time clock

 8   beeping}.

 9          Did my answer get beeped?

10          SENATOR PERSAUD:   Can he finish

11   answering the question for me, please?     Thank

12   you.

13          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Give it a whirl,

14   yup.

15          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Okay, I'll

16   give it a whirl.

17          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    And then when we

18   cut you off, you will answer anything further

19   in writing to us all.

20          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Absolutely.

21          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

22          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     So -- I'm

23   sorry, where were we?

24          (Laughter.)
                                                       128

 1            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    We'll get

 2   back to that question, I apologize.

 3            SENATOR PERSAUD:   Thank you.

 4            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 5            Assembly.

 6            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 7   Assemblywoman Jaffee.

 8            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Thank you.

 9   There is so much need, and we really -- in so

10   many communities, it's truly unfortunate and

11   troubling and very traumatic in many areas.

12   I can tell you I've met with so many

13   throughout -- in my areas as well who are

14   struggling.    Too much homelessness in this

15   state.    It's just unacceptable.

16            But I wanted to ask -- and I thank you

17   for the work that you are doing, and the

18   leadership, and really attempting to respond

19   to so many of these issues and to so many

20   families in particular.

21            In terms of certain of the issues

22   regarding mental illness or substance abuse,

23   domestic violence, all those real issues, is

24   there counseling -- did you -- how do you
                                                     129

 1   move forward in terms of providing support?

 2   Is there recommended counseling?   How does

 3   that work?

 4         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Okay.   I

 5   think -- if we're talking about street

 6   homelessness at this point --

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     Well,

 8   homelessness in --

 9         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     In general?

10         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     -- you know,

11   those who have substance disorder, what

12   exactly is provided to assist them?

13         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Well, the

14   nonprofits that we work with, and we work

15   with shelters on plans, and we also work with

16   the local districts that will bring those

17   types of services into the shelters to be

18   able to assist in that process.

19         We're also simultaneously working with

20   OMH on strategies to be able to enhance

21   mental health services -- again, one of those

22   classic conversations where no one who is

23   seeking true mental health services who walks

24   into a hospital should ever walk out the door
                                                          130

 1   the next day.    Okay?   To be able to try to be

 2   in a scenario where we're able to provide

 3   real assistance and real services is

 4   something that we're working on.

 5           We also have homeless services plans

 6   with each one of the districts specifically

 7   dedicated to being able to address mental

 8   health issues as well as substance abuse

 9   issues.

10           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     Thank you.   I

11   think what I'm going to do to move forward,

12   given this information, is meet with some of

13   these groups to really see exactly how things

14   are moving forward.      So I appreciate that,

15   and the funding that's provided.      Because it

16   really is a disaster in certain areas, you

17   know.

18           Thank you.

19           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

20           To the Senate?

21           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22           Senator Velmanette Montgomery.

23           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     {Mic off.}   Thank

24   you.    Good morning, Commissioner.
                                                        131

 1         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Good morning.

 2         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     {Mic on.}   Good

 3   morning.   Thank you so much for your patience

 4   answering some questions.

 5         I just want to ask you specifically

 6   about the whole issue of homeless housing.

 7   So I was able to visit one of the programs

 8   that really focuses on housing for young

 9   people, and the thing that was so striking to

10   me is that it's really a very strong

11   organization, they do a very excellent job.

12   They serve young people, I believe up to

13   maybe age 24 or so, but for practically every

14   young person in that program, in that

15   facility, with excellent supports, great

16   service, great outcomes.    But it took

17   basically a whole staff department to figure

18   out how each of those young people, how their

19   service was funded.

20         So it just occurs to me that we have a

21   great investment in terms of homeless

22   housing, but there are so many different

23   regulations for the same population.      I just

24   don't understand.
                                                     132

 1         So my question to you is, to what

 2   extent are we looking to coordinate the

 3   funding streams and the regulations and the

 4   guidelines and all of those things between

 5   the different agencies, you and other

 6   commissioners, HCR and whoever else is doing

 7   housing, so that there is a uniform way of

 8   looking.   If a person is homeless, if they

 9   were just recently homeless, if they were

10   about to be homeless -- why should we have a

11   different set of regulations for each of

12   those different categories?   So that's one

13   question that I have.

14         And the other thing that I would like

15   to ask you to comment on, all over the

16   state -- we've been traveling around the

17   state, and everywhere we go, homeless and

18   housing are critical issues for practically

19   all of the different categories of people who

20   are vulnerable, and families in particular.

21   So how are we looking at this as a statewide

22   issue but looking at the different regions,

23   what their needs are, and ways in which we

24   can tailor our activity to meet the needs
                                                      133

 1   from Long Island to the rest of the state?

 2         And the last part of my question is,

 3   families and children are particularly

 4   vulnerable.    The way that we -- so children

 5   also need to be able to get into a school no

 6   matter where they end up, where their family

 7   ends up, whether it's the Bronx or Brooklyn

 8   or whatever.   And many times we have families

 9   who are temporarily housed in Brooklyn,

10   children left school and have to go all the

11   way back to the Bronx, and it just creates an

12   impossible life for young -- for children

13   whose families find themselves in homeless

14   shelters in particular.

15         So I would like to hear how you are

16   looking at trying to figure out a resolution

17   or a solution to some of these issues that

18   we're talking about.

19         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    I'd like to

20   start by saying that may be the best question

21   I've ever been asked.

22         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:    And you only have

23   a minute, so we'll --

24         (Laughter.)
                                                         134

 1            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   -- I know, we'll

 2   take it in writing, but whatever you have to

 3   say --

 4            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Very

 5   comprehensive.

 6            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   -- would be

 7   helpful.

 8            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   I'll go fast.

 9            (Laughter.)

10            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   First and

11   foremost, I understand -- I've been in these

12   shelters, I've seen the issues, and I

13   understand the importance of being able to

14   make sure that children can go to the school

15   and keep a continuity and what that can mean

16   in the quality of an individual's life.      What

17   that means also for the entire family, for

18   after-school programs, for the like.

19            So there is a significant commitment

20   to that in the shelters at this point, but I

21   always say we can do better.    And so there's

22   a reality on that front.

23            The homeless services plans that we're

24   talking about, when you hear us mentioning
                                                      135

 1   those, those really are designed to be able

 2   to better coordinate services.      That's the

 3   next logical step, first to develop the

 4   homeless services plans and then to begin to

 5   work on a level of coordination between

 6   agencies, between local districts and the

 7   state to ensure that it's seamless.     And to

 8   make sure that there isn't waste when it

 9   comes to the process, to make sure the

10   services that are delivered are actually

11   benefiting the individuals who are in need.

12         {Timeclock beeping.}

13         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     And

14   streamlining --

15         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       Just under

16   the wire.

17         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     -- streamlining

18   regulations, please.

19         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       Correct.

20         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 1         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    {Mic off;

 2   inaudible.}

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Thank you

 4   very much.

 5         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Ah, here we

 6   go.

 7         I would like, if you could, to have

 8   you share with us -- first of all, I want to

 9   thank you for the money and the attention to

10   homeless vets.   Obviously, as chair of

11   Veterans' Affairs, that's a key issue.

12         I would like to hear your thoughts on

13   what is in this budget to support people at

14   risk and others in rural communities.     I

15   always feel like this budget focuses so much

16   on urban issues, and we have issues of

17   homelessness, we have issues, obviously, of

18   rural suicide where -- you know, agricultural

19   challenges, all sorts of things going on in

20   our -- the rural parts of the state.      And I'd

21   love to hear your thoughts on that, please.

22         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sure.    I

23   think one of the challenges -- and again,

24   having come from the role of a county
                                                     137

 1   executive in a rural county that also had an

 2   urban center in it, we understood fully the

 3   differences that could exist in those

 4   situations.   And obviously rural poverty is

 5   very different in those situations.

 6         For us, it still comes about making

 7   sure that everybody has access to services,

 8   making sure that social service districts are

 9   doing what they're supposed to.   We have a

10   regulatory role in that process, in making

11   sure the programs that we roll out really are

12   thoughtful of the idea that what works in,

13   say, Clinton County is very different than

14   what may work in the Bronx.

15         And so there's a real thought process

16   that goes into all of our planning in this

17   process.   And again, those homeless services

18   plans, when you're dealing with specifically

19   the homeless population, it's again tailored

20   to the individual district.

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    But what does

22   that look like?   Because I don't think that

23   we have the services in the rural parts of

24   the area that we have in even -- in -- for
                                                         138

 1   example, like, you know, in Kingston or in

 2   Poughkeepsie, the eastern parts of my

 3   district aren't -- don't have any of those

 4   resources.

 5           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     I wouldn't

 6   disagree that there are areas that are less

 7   served than others, there's no question about

 8   that.   And I think that there needs to be an

 9   effort towards that end.    I think we're very

10   focused on being able to make sure we bring

11   that kind of parity across the system.

12           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Okay.     So at

13   the moment there isn't anything intentional,

14   but you'll work on that?

15           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Absolutely.

16           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Okay.     Thank

17   you very much.

18           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Thank you.

19           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Senate?

20           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator May.

21           SENATOR MAY:   Commissioner, you

22   probably heard the question I asked earlier

23   about functional homelessness.      Is that a

24   concept that you deal with?     We have a lot
                                                        139

 1   of -- we said 10 percent of the student

 2   population is either homeless or functionally

 3   homeless in Syracuse, so they're living on

 4   someone's couch.

 5         Is that -- is that just a concept in

 6   your lexicon, and do you have ways of dealing

 7   with it?

 8         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      It's not lost

 9   on us at all in that situation.    And we

10   recognize that there is a portion of the

11   population that is, for lack of a better

12   conversation, couch surfing.    And that

13   scenario, we are very focused and working

14   with the not-for-profits and with the schools

15   to make sure that we can identify those

16   individuals and those families, to make sure

17   that they are accessing the services that are

18   available in that particular district.      That

19   really is the challenge, though.

20         But there's no question, there's a

21   segment of the population that is not falling

22   into the standard counts.

23         SENATOR MAY:   All right.    Thank you.

24         And do you expect the MRT process to
                                                         140

 1   have representation of people who represent

 2   the concerns of community-based nonprofits

 3   that are dealing with the needs of people

 4   with disabilities or the populations that you

 5   serve?

 6            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   I would defer

 7   to others on discussions about the MRT.     I'm

 8   sure that all of us are anxiously awaiting

 9   what is inevitably going to be a very

10   difficult job.

11            SENATOR MAY:   Okay.   And then finally,

12   about refugees.    So all across the Thruway

13   communities, refugees are very important

14   parts of our communities.

15            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   No question

16   about it.

17            SENATOR MAY:   And the federal

18   government has basically abdicated its role

19   both in resettling refugees but also

20   supporting the refugees who are here already.

21            Just can you tell me what you're doing

22   to support the organizations that are there

23   to help them --

24            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sure.
                                                       141

 1         SENATOR MAY:     -- and the people

 2   themselves?

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Again, in

 4   serving our refugees -- I'll give you the

 5   good news.    There hasn't been a drop in

 6   federal funding at this point.    Okay?    That

 7   doesn't mean that we're not concerned about

 8   it, because we are.    When the access to

 9   communities, especially in New York, of

10   individuals who are coming who are refugees,

11   it's a deep concern.   We have seen a

12   significant drop in numbers.

13         The Governor has made it very clear

14   that New York is open, New York is here and

15   welcoming, and it's what we were built on and

16   that we are very focused on that.   So -- but

17   when it comes to the services, obviously

18   language services, obviously any and all of

19   the social services that we have available on

20   the human services side of the house, making

21   sure that access to schooling and culturally

22   competent services -- that front as well.

23         SENATOR MAY:     So is there any kind of

24   additional funding -- I mean, when you say
                                                       142

 1   federal funding hasn't dropped --

 2         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     It doesn't

 3   mean --

 4         SENATOR MAY:     If they're not

 5   resettling people --

 6         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Correct.

 7         SENATOR MAY:      -- then they are not

 8   sending the money in.

 9         And there are a bunch of organizations

10   that -- Interfaith works, for example, in

11   Syracuse, which does a huge amount of work

12   with refugees, and they have depended -- you

13   know, a lot of their funding has come from

14   new refugees coming in and they're not

15   getting that funding now.    So they're having

16   to stretch everything they've got to provide

17   the language support services and the, you

18   know, cultural support services that

19   they're --

20         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Sure.

21         SENATOR MAY:     So I'm just wondering,

22   is the state trying to fill those gaps?

23         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Yeah, I think

24   it probably warrants a further conversation.
                                                     143

 1   And if you don't mind, I'd like to be able to

 2   have that with you.

 3         SENATOR MAY:    Okay.   Thank you.

 4         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     You're

 5   welcome.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7         Assembly.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Assemblyman

 9   Walczyk.

10         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     Thank you,

11   Chairwoman.

12         Good morning, I think, still.

13   Commissioner, appreciate the time.

14         We've talked a little bit about

15   different solutions to end homelessness in

16   the State of New York, and we actually have a

17   program by that title already, the Solution

18   to End Homelessness Program, or STEP, as many

19   call it.

20         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:    Why, in your

22   view, were a handful of counties in rural and

23   upstate New York denied their renewal for a

24   five-year contract in this last round last
                                                        144

 1   year?

 2            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Well, I think

 3   it's really important, when we talk about

 4   STEP, we highlight the fact that there was no

 5   cut in the STEP funding.

 6            There is a normal process of the

 7   procurement that takes place every five

 8   years.     And in that process we are very

 9   focused on being able to make sure that we

10   obviously follow the rules, follow the law,

11   and make sure that we meet -- again, some

12   wonderful, wonderful programs that are out

13   there.

14            But we also do recognize that in that

15   process sometimes there are programs that are

16   not selected, and they can be -- we're aware

17   of the program that you're speaking about,

18   and we're very focused on trying to figure

19   out are there alternative ways to be able to

20   move through procurement going forward.      And

21   we look forward to having that conversation

22   as well.

23            We think there could be kind of a

24   step-down process to STEP that might be also
                                                       145

 1   helpful.    We're exploring different options.

 2         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     Well, I

 3   appreciate that, and your remaining open and

 4   flexible and understanding.

 5         As we were talking on the dais here, I

 6   could hear a number of different things that

 7   certainly strike home for me.   Watertown,

 8   New York, is home to the Urban Mission, who

 9   has taken advantage of STEP funding in the

10   past and is actually I think a shining

11   example of what we can do here to bridge

12   people out of poverty and provide that sort

13   of extra hand up for their independence.

14   They actually have a 97 percent success rate

15   six months after someone has used rapid

16   rehousing through Urban Mission and your STEP

17   funding.    Six months later, they're in stable

18   housing and independent -- 97 percent of

19   their clientele.

20         You know, in 2018 they served 830

21   families:    34 percent of those families had

22   children under 18, 3 percent of them were

23   veterans.    So, I mean, we're hitting a lot of

24   the -- you can talk about the programs and
                                                      146

 1   consolidating all of them.    I think this is

 2   one of those excellent methods that when you

 3   leave it to the locals who know it and do it

 4   every day, it's a shining example of what we

 5   can do right.

 6         So I appreciate your flexibility and

 7   look forward to working with you further on

 8   that one.

 9         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:        Thank you

10   very much, Assemblyman.

11         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:    Most programs

12   that we have in the State of New York -- this

13   is a little bit bigger-picture, if you'll

14   entertain me --

15         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sure.

16         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     -- are based on

17   income thresholds.   And I just wondered if

18   you could sort of explain your beliefs in

19   benefit cliffs and whether they're a myth or

20   a reality, and then what we can do and what

21   your agency can do moving forward to

22   eliminate some of those benefit cliffs

23   programmatically.    And how we as

24   policymakers, sitting here and making
                                                      147

 1   decisions that restrict you and your agency's

 2   ability, what we can do to make a difference

 3   and remove some of those cliffs.

 4         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Again, the

 5   concept of benefit cliffs are huge and

 6   depends on -- again, it's a public policy

 7   kind of a conversation that is so critically

 8   important:    Making sure that an individual

 9   who is receiving services isn't provided with

10   a disincentive to be able to continue to

11   transition.

12         That's why currently in our benefits

13   package there are transitional benefits to be

14   able to assist people in a whole host of

15   areas, whether it be through SNAP or whether

16   it be through Medicare.   It's a whole host of

17   benefits that come through on a transitional

18   basis to be able to assist in that process.

19         But again, as we look at what these

20   cliffs look like, those are big, real

21   conversations.   If what we're talking about

22   is providing additional benefits, we have to

23   understand what's the exit strategy to help

24   someone transition off of public assistance.
                                                     148

 1         A good example of that is making sure

 2   that they have significant employment

 3   training that can get someone through that

 4   process.   Last year 51,000 individuals

 5   transitioned from public assistance into the

 6   private sector.

 7         (Discussion off the record.)

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Senator Savino.

 9         SENATOR SAVINO:    Thank you, Senator

10   Krueger.

11         Good afternoon.    Just 12 o'clock on

12   the dot, Commissioner.

13         I just want to quickly echo some of

14   the comments of some of my other colleagues,

15   my concern about the Summer Youth Employment

16   and the length of OMH time it takes to do the

17   processing.

18         As well as -- I'm going to tell you

19   the same thing I told you last year and as I

20   recently told Commissioner Poole from OCFS.

21   It's beginning to be offensive -- and I know

22   this is not your decision; you didn't craft

23   the budget.   It's beginning to be offensive,

24   though, as a New York City representative and
                                                     149

 1   a New York City taxpayer, that the state says

 2   to the City of New York that the people who

 3   live there are your responsibility with no

 4   obligation on the part of the state.    It's

 5   just inherently offensive to New York City.

 6   They are not New York City's children or New

 7   York City's elderly or New York City's

 8   seniors or New York City's poor.    They are

 9   the state's.   We are all residents of this

10   one state.    I just have to say that again.

11         Because assuming that the city will

12   pick up the responsibility for everything

13   because they will find a way to make it work,

14   these are also requirements that are placed

15   on the City of New York by the State of

16   New York.

17         So I would just hope that we could

18   begin to stop this trend of shifting the

19   burden totally to the City of New York for

20   everything.

21         I want to ask specifically about one

22   program because, as you know, there are

23   severe challenges to providing housing for

24   people who are either suffering from mental
                                                         150

 1   health issues or the fragile elderly.    A lot

 2   of them have relied on adult homes over the

 3   years.    The adult home industry is closing

 4   largely because of the Olmstead decision,

 5   which says we have to move people to, you

 6   know, independent living where we can.       Many

 7   of those individuals are decompensating, and

 8   they are winding up in our nursing homes

 9   because there's nowhere for them to go

10   because the adult homes aren't there.

11            One of the things that could help

12   stabilize the adult homes while they're still

13   needed is an increase in the SSI rate.     And I

14   know the feds have pushed through this SSI

15   COLA increase.    What can we do to allow them

16   to capture more of the SSI rate so that they

17   can help provide more stable homes for people

18   who really have nowhere else to go?

19            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   We recognize

20   that there was legislation to be able to move

21   down that path.    I think the conversation

22   really moves now to -- again, that took place

23   outside the budget confines last time, and it

24   ultimately ended up in a veto.
                                                       151

 1           I think the question really is to have

 2   those kinds of public policy conversations

 3   during the context of the budget, because --

 4           SENATOR SAVINO:   What we're doing

 5   right here.    That's why I'm asking you.

 6           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    I appreciate

 7   that.   But we don't -- it's not that we do

 8   not understand and appreciate the management

 9   magnitude of what those organizations do.

10           SENATOR SAVINO:   Well, I just don't

11   want to go down that rabbit hole again where

12   we pass legislation and the Governor vetoes

13   it, saying it belongs in the context of the

14   budget, and we try and put it in the budget

15   and they kick it out and say do it later in

16   legislation, because that's not solving the

17   problem.    We really need to figure out an

18   answer to that.

19           And I think that was it.   Oh, no, one

20   question.    In the Governor's budget proposal

21   he projects that public assistance cases are

22   going to be reduced by about 6,000.    How do

23   we -- where did we arrive at that number?

24   How did we arrive at the projection that
                                                        152

 1   we're -- public assistance either applicants

 2   or cases are being reduced or dropping?

 3            OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   No problem.

 4   We used an econometric model that was

 5   consistent with how things are going across

 6   the entire state and what trends are showing.

 7   And that's traditionally the model that we

 8   utilize to be able to do that.

 9            Again, we have seen trends moving

10   downward at this point.     But also, obviously,

11   we have to make sure that OTDA is prepared,

12   in case we have a scenario where the economy

13   turns or other challenges come forward, we

14   have to be able to provide those services.

15            SENATOR SAVINO:   And I just want to

16   echo also the concern about the benefit

17   cliff.    We hear that routinely from agencies

18   that employ people who are marginal.     And

19   unfortunately, one of the unintended

20   consequences of the minimum wage increase is

21   it puts people up against the benefit cliff

22   and it forces them to make a very harsh

23   decision, staying in the workforce or leaving

24   their job because they can't afford to
                                                       153

 1   replace Medicaid, SNAP, or any of other

 2   supplemental benefits that they receive.

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.

 4         SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you.

 5         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Thank you.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Assembly.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We go to

 8   Assemblywoman Wright.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Good afternoon.

10         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Good

11   afternoon.

12         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Thank you very

13   much for being here.

14         And I guess my question sort of

15   follows suit to some of the others that have

16   already been made, because we are talking

17   about how we're tailoring needs to actually

18   address what the local communities need

19   and/or have decided would help their local

20   population.   But we're finding that it's --

21   so I'm going to ask you to help me reconcile

22   or how we might be able to reconcile the

23   challenge that we're facing, in that housing

24   for the elderly -- I live in an aging
                                                       154

 1   community -- the housing for the elderly and

 2   the benefits for the elderly, particularly if

 3   we use the term fragile elderly, is being

 4   supplanted with homeless and oftentimes

 5   chronic homeless when we try to develop

 6   housing options for our aging communities.

 7   So I guess I'm going to pass that to you.

 8         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     To me, I look

 9   at these scenarios and say to myself, these

10   are -- though they're oftentimes discrete

11   populations, the reality is there's need for

12   help on both fronts.   Okay?

13         And so when it comes to what OTDA

14   focuses on, we're very focused on homeless

15   housing, obviously, through HHAP as a

16   critical component of that.    We're excited

17   about what that means in making sure that

18   those housing projects take place.    But we

19   shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we also

20   invest heavily as a partner from HHAP in

21   projects that serve a great deal of people

22   across the entire spectrum, not just

23   individuals who are homeless.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     So I guess
                                                       155

 1   because we're not seeing an emphasis on the

 2   elderly or those who are disabled elderly,

 3   we're not getting funding to help support

 4   that endeavor.

 5           So in aging communities where people

 6   are unable to take stairs, they need

 7   assistance to get dressed, they -- we're

 8   just -- we're -- I understand the emphasis on

 9   homelessness.    But what we're doing is

10   creating a population of elderly that are

11   homeless or going into nursing homes

12   prematurely, and they shouldn't have to do

13   that.

14           So I guess what I'm asking as if

15   there's a way for us to begin to emphasize

16   that there is a disabled elderly population

17   that needs particular attention.

18           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   The answer is

19   yes.    It's not a traditional HHAP kind of a

20   discussion, but there's no question that

21   there's need in the area.

22           ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:   Okay.   What

23   about as a disability conversation?     Are we

24   having it as part of the disability
                                                     156

 1   conversation?   Because that would be a

 2   disability.

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     The answer

 4   would be yes, in other agencies within state

 5   government.    The disability within OTDA

 6   really is about disability determinations.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Okay.   All

 8   right, thank you.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

10         Senate?

11         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator Sue

12   Serino.

13         SENATOR SERINO:    Thank you.

14         And good afternoon, Commissioner Hein.

15   So good to see you here.   And as

16   Assemblymember Barrett said, we miss you in

17   the Hudson Valley but are very happy that

18   you're here.

19         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Thank you.

20         SENATOR SERINO:    And I'd like to just

21   comment on Assemblyman Hevesi's comments on

22   human trafficking.   I thank him and you for

23   working on that.    It's something that we've

24   been working on in the Hudson Valley as well.
                                                       157

 1   And I always say education is the key to

 2   prevention.    I carry a couple of bills for

 3   that.

 4           I was thrilled to see the additional

 5   $5 million included in the proposal to

 6   address the issue of homelessness among

 7   veterans.    I was just wondering if you can

 8   tell us how that funding would be

 9   distributed.

10           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Well, the

11   exciting part about that is that the

12   additional $5 million will obviously go for

13   units across the state, to be able to provide

14   housing for the individuals.

15           We are also seeing homelessness among

16   the veterans population around the state fall

17   precipitously, so the capacity to be able to

18   really move towards a number where we

19   hopefully long for the day where there are no

20   homeless veterans anywhere.    And so this is

21   an effort to be able to push towards that

22   direction.    You'll see additional units being

23   built, but we shouldn't lose sight that the

24   housing units that HHAP also does oftentimes
                                                       158

 1   have a veterans component attached to them.

 2         I was at an incredibly wonderful

 3   opening at a place that's called Serve Vets

 4   in Coney Island, and it really is

 5   extraordinary.   We're seeing individuals have

 6   life-altering experiences.   I was in the

 7   apartment of a gentleman who really was so

 8   proud to be able to show it, and it was the

 9   first time he had permanent housing in

10   20 years.

11         SENATOR SERINO:   Oh, that's amazing.

12         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   A wonderful

13   veteran.

14         SENATOR SERINO:   I'm concerned,

15   though, there's a line in the proposal,

16   though, that reads, essentially:    However, if

17   an insufficient number of viable proposals

18   for veterans are received, the balance of the

19   funding can be used for the development of

20   housing for other priority-need populations.

21         And I know that we're talking about it

22   going down, but I've known you for a long

23   time and I know, like me, you care deeply

24   about our veterans.
                                                       159

 1         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.

 2         SENATOR SERINO:     So I just wanted to

 3   put this on your radar.    And you know, we --

 4   and I know the Dwyer money doesn't come under

 5   your budget, but the Dwyer funds and the

 6   people that work -- I know in our district we

 7   have a great team of guys and gals, and they

 8   help get that message out and they find our

 9   homeless veterans.    So I don't know if other

10   areas are the same.    So when you're not

11   getting proposals from other areas, they just

12   might not have their finger on the pulse like

13   our guys do.   So just something -- like I

14   said, I'd like to put that on your radar, and

15   hopefully take that --

16         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Your point is

17   not lost.

18         SENATOR SERINO:     -- part out if it's

19   at all possible.

20         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     I think it's

21   designed to be able to provide maximum

22   flexibility.   I don't see it ever being a

23   provision that would be utilized.   In that

24   situation we fully expect that we will have
                                                       160

 1   to satisfy veteran proposals to be able to

 2   move this forward.

 3         We're working, again, with Veterans'

 4   Services at the state level also to make sure

 5   that we're coordinated in our efforts,

 6   because I think it's really important.

 7         SENATOR SERINO:   That's great.     Thank

 8   you so much.

 9         And Senator Savino had spoken to you a

10   little bit about the SSI.   And like you said,

11   that's something that we've passed bills, you

12   know, constantly in the Assembly and the

13   Senate, and the Governor had vetoed it.    And

14   I understand that the SSI pass-through falls

15   in your portion of the budget.

16         So the current rate, for those that

17   are listening, is only $41 a day.   And

18   because of this abysmal rate, dozens of homes

19   serving SSI individuals have closed after the

20   last few years.   You know, I was chair of

21   Aging for four years, and now ranker, and it

22   just breaks your heart because it's one of

23   our most vulnerable populations.    So -- and

24   that state supplement has only been increased
                                                       161

 1   once in 25 years.

 2         So I wanted to know what you think

 3   about -- is the $41 a day adequate?    What are

 4   your feelings on that?

 5         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Again, this

 6   is that time for that conversation.    Because,

 7   you know, we've talked about whether it takes

 8   place in or outside the budget.    Clearly it

 9   is budget time and it's an internal budget

10   conversation, and we would be glad to be able

11   to participate in that conversation.

12         SENATOR SERINO:    Great.    I look

13   forward to talking to you, Commissioner,

14   about this, so can we fight for our

15   vulnerable population.   Thank you.

16         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

18         Assembly.

19         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We'll go to

20   Assemblyman Ra for a question.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:    Good afternoon.

22         So I tried to ask this earlier, but

23   I'm told you are the appropriate

24   representative to ask about the Pay for
                                                        162

 1   Success program.

 2         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       I'll have to

 3   take that up with Sheila.

 4         (Laughter.)

 5         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:      Or you can take it up

 6   with Assemblyman Hevesi, because he also

 7   recommended --

 8         (Laughter.)

 9         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:      -- that I ask you

10   about the issue.

11         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       I hate to do

12   this, because I think I could answer it very

13   quickly.   I heard this, the -- Senator

14   Krueger was right, we were in the room, so we

15   heard the question.

16         The challenge is Pay for Success isn't

17   an OTDA program.   Okay?    So we will gladly

18   find the answer for you, because it's a

19   legitimate question and you have every right

20   to have an answer to it, but it's not an OTDA

21   program.

22         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:      Okay.   Thank you.

23         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:        Senate?

24         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.
                                                      163

 1          Senator John Brooks.

 2          SENATOR BROOKS:   Thank you,

 3   Madam Chair.

 4          Actually, two of my colleagues touched

 5   on a point that I just want to reemphasize.

 6   I think the homelessness on the college

 7   campuses is far higher than we think and much

 8   more dangerous than we think, particularly in

 9   those areas where the climate this time of

10   year is not the best.

11          And the other issue on the veterans'

12   housing -- I think, again, that's a hidden

13   problem too.   Many of those who are homeless

14   are too proud to step forward.   I'm not sure

15   that $5 million is anywheres near enough.    I

16   think there are individuals who take steps to

17   try to protect themselves, but if they miss,

18   they're risking their lives in some of the

19   locations they're putting themselves in right

20   now.

21          So I appreciate that we do have a

22   program designed specifically to look at the

23   vets, but I think that too is a bigger

24   problem than we think.   And I think -- I was
                                                      164

 1   in a meeting the other day on the island

 2   where a group said, "No, we don't have

 3   homeless vets anymore on Long Island."

 4   That's not even close to being right.

 5         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Of course.

 6         SENATOR BROOKS:   And I think -- one of

 7   the things I worry about sometimes is we're

 8   not being as honest with ourselves as we

 9   should about the significant number of people

10   who are first homeless -- and then we had an

11   incident over the summer where I was speaking

12   with a group of kids in an educational

13   program, and the teacher told us the one

14   girl -- part of the educational program was

15   current events, and the girl wasn't allowed

16   to watch television at night.   So they helped

17   her with the current events.

18         When I talked to them later and we

19   talked about getting food and the rest, it

20   wasn't that she wasn't allowed to watch

21   television.   The family had no electricity.

22   Which meant they had no heat, which meant

23   they didn't have hot water, which meant they

24   couldn't keep food.
                                                     165

 1          So we're in a situation that there's

 2   almost grades of homeless.   Being in a house

 3   that doesn't have electricity or heat is

 4   homeless.

 5          But I appreciate that you're working

 6   on the programs that covered it, so I didn't

 7   have a specific question, I just wanted to

 8   underscore how significant these problems

 9   are.

10          OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Senator,

11   thank you very much.

12          I will share with you something --

13   again, for that kind of a scenario where an

14   individual is in a home but has an electrical

15   shutoff, there are programs and emergency

16   services available to assist them to make

17   sure that that does not take place.

18          There is a significant commitment in

19   every district to make sure that the capacity

20   exists to be able to help individuals in that

21   particular condition.

22          The other situation that you were

23   mentioning about homelessness among veterans,

24   I come from a community -- and I remember
                                                      166

 1   hearing those voices that said, We don't have

 2   a homeless problem among our veterans

 3   population.   And ultimately we built the

 4   transitional housing for homeless veterans

 5   and we really -- there was a big move to be

 6   able to reduce homeless veterans within our

 7   community, and it was ragingly successful,

 8   especially when you began to tackle things

 9   like PTSD and a series of other major issues

10   that happened at that point.

11         SENATOR BROOKS:   Yeah.    I brought up

12   the young lady only to illustrate the fact

13   that she just accepted that as a way of life,

14   didn't think it was out of the norm.

15         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.     I

16   think you're really talking about adverse

17   childhood experiences, you're talking about

18   childhood trauma, you're talking about things

19   that affect people for their life.    It's why

20   many of us got into human services in the

21   first place, to be able to make a difference

22   and change people's lives.

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.    I

24   believe I'm next, and last for the Senate.
                                                      167

 1         I'm glad you closed with childhood

 2   trauma with Senator Brooks, because we look

 3   at the numbers of children who are in the

 4   shelter system and we might as well be

 5   writing up the reports now on what we're

 6   going to need to pay into their adult years

 7   because they did have so much childhood

 8   trauma, moving from location to location,

 9   school to school, et cetera, et cetera.

10         So the Governor said in his -- I

11   believe it was the State of the State speech,

12   not his budget speech, that he was going to

13   do more for homelessness this year than ever.

14   So tell me how we're doing more this year

15   than ever.   I know that we have a commitment

16   from 2016 for 20,000 supportive housing beds.

17   We've only gotten to 6,000.   Are we doing

18   14,000 this year?   How many are we doing?

19         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Again, I will

20   only speak to the commitment as I understand

21   it, and the commitment as I understand it is,

22   again, the $20 billion that is for affordable

23   housing across the board, 6,000 supportive

24   units to be completed in a five-year window
                                                      168

 1   that ends next year.   We should highlight --

 2   and then a 15,000 -- excuse me, a 20,000 unit

 3   commitment for supportive housing over

 4   15 years.

 5         And so when it comes to the

 6   commitment -- and we should touch base on

 7   this -- we're very proud of the work that has

 8   happened.   We've got an enormous amount of it

 9   through HHAP, but obviously others as well in

10   this process.   And when it comes to the

11   supportive housing side, we now have

12   4,000-plus units, well on our way to being

13   able to attain and exceed the 6,000

14   supportive housing units.

15         That doesn't mean there isn't even

16   greater need, but that commitment is -- we're

17   very focused on being able to make sure that

18   we attain it and exceed it.   And the overall

19   affordable housing number, we are also ahead

20   of schedule.

21         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So you also

22   referenced -- and I think in answer to a

23   question, not in your testimony -- that the

24   City of New York, with the largest numbers of
                                                     169

 1   homeless, is spending too much money in their

 2   programs.   So can the state do it cheaper,

 3   and will you?

 4         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    If you're

 5   asking if the state will take over Family

 6   Assistance and Family Assistance operations,

 7   what we are working with with New York City

 8   at this point is to be able to amend their

 9   homeless services plan and to assist them to

10   be able to speed the process.   You're really

11   talking about extremely expensive hotel and

12   motel rooms, and the attempt to be able to

13   reduce the time spent in those units.

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    What is the most

15   cost-efficient model for ensuring that people

16   don't continue to flow into our very

17   expensive homeless shelter system with such a

18   long timeline for getting them out of the

19   homeless shelter system?

20         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Sufficient

21   permanent housing.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    What prevents us

23   from getting them into sufficient permanent

24   housing?
                                                       170

 1         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Enough units.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Enough --

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Enough units.

 4   And again, we are in a scenario right now,

 5   especially in the metro New York area, where

 6   that portion of it -- there is, without

 7   question, a crisis with that situation.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Do you think it

 9   has anything to do with too little rental

10   assistance to afford the units in the

11   locations where people are?

12         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Well, what I

13   would say is this.   Very few people are

14   transitioning -- not in total numbers, but

15   I'm talking about percentagewise,

16   transitioning over from PA into the shelter

17   system.   Okay?   So there are clear strong

18   supports, both state but again extensively

19   from the city as well, to have supports in

20   place to be able to assist people staying in

21   their homes, CITYFEPS and the like.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So I just want to

23   repeat that.   So we don't think -- your data

24   shows people are not ending up in a shelter
                                                      171

 1   system having been evicted from an apartment

 2   they couldn't afford.

 3         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    No, we're not

 4   saying that at all.   What we're saying is

 5   that that percentage is significantly less

 6   than people who are not coming out of the PA

 7   system.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So where are the

 9   people coming from?

10         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    Again, I

11   think that we're seeing a whole myriad of

12   reasons for homelessness.    In the city,

13   obviously cost of housing.    Clearly things

14   like mental health and substance use

15   disorders and a whole host of other

16   challenges, as well as economic factors.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Have you taken a

18   look at the Assemblymember's housing support

19   proposing -- the HSS proposal which would

20   provide an increased rental supplement to

21   keep people in their homes or to move them

22   out of shelters?

23         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:    I have.

24         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     What is your
                                                        172

 1   opinion of that?

 2         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Well, again,

 3   I think rather than being able to comment

 4   specifically on any legislation, I think it's

 5   important that we talk -- and again I commend

 6   the Assemblymember and everyone else for

 7   pushing to have this kind of public policy

 8   conversation.    We think it's really

 9   important.

10         For me, it's more about the

11   conversations about what things should be

12   considered in the conversation and how we

13   move forward.    Clearly there's budgetary

14   concerns associated with that, and the

15   finances need to be addressed.

16         There also needs to be -- in my

17   opinion, one of the factors that should be

18   discussed is how we ensure that when we look

19   across the entire state that we're not

20   treating, say, Clinton County the same as we

21   would treat the Bronx or some other portion

22   of the city.    We want to make sure that --

23   again, to me, those are two of the -- two key

24   components.     I want to make sure that I don't
                                                       173

 1   make mistakes, and I really appreciate the

 2   time.

 3           In addition to local variations, there

 4   is the cliff conversation that needs to at

 5   least be discussed, and how we're going to

 6   transition over.    I know that there's a

 7   component of it that carries out for an

 8   additional year.    But the real conversation

 9   about how we ensure that an individual

10   doesn't find themselves in a situation where

11   the cliff makes them -- in a situation where

12   they're just as bad but a year or two down

13   the road.   Okay?

14           We understand the value in the

15   conversation.   And I am also very much

16   looking forward to the outcomes of the pilots

17   that have been proposed.   I think the pilot

18   in New York City will be a very informative

19   study, specifically tied to, again, the area

20   where we see some of the biggest crisis.    But

21   also to be able to see the results of that

22   pilot in Rochester will speak volumes about

23   how upstate cities are dealing with that as

24   well.
                                                     174

 1         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Because there are

 2   such higher costs for housing in New York

 3   City --

 4         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   No question.

 5         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   -- does the state

 6   support the City of New York moving people

 7   into other counties with lower costs for

 8   housing and shelter?

 9         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Again, if

10   what we're talking about is the SOTA program

11   that was traditionally run and continues to

12   be run out of the city, we shouldn't lose

13   sight of the fact that that program is funded

14   solely with city dollars and not state

15   dollars.

16         But we do support, if individuals can

17   find access to employment or family members,

18   that people have a right to be able to move.

19         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Okay.   Would you

20   support the city being allowed to use money

21   they currently can only use for shelter

22   placement -- which I think is now close to

23   72,000 a year -- would you allow the city to

24   use more of those funds specifically to help
                                                      175

 1   provide rental housing so that either the

 2   family can go into a housing unit sooner or

 3   avoid having to leave a housing unit?

 4           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   I think it's

 5   an area that I'm going to have to take a

 6   closer look at.   I can't speak to it right

 7   now.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   So -- but you

 9   will take a look at that.

10           OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:   Absolutely.

11           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Okay.   Because

12   we're basically setting up that only the most

13   expensive failed model can be used.    So I

14   would really like the state to look at the

15   economics of that.

16           And you are right that not everybody

17   goes into the shelter system from losing a

18   home.   The data actually shows a huge

19   percentage, at least of the singles, are

20   released from State DOCCS -- I think about a

21   third of the people going into the singles

22   shelter system.

23           There are other -- and there have been

24   historically MOUs and discharge planning so
                                                        176

 1   that people leaving mental health

 2   institutions, people leaving DOCCS aren't

 3   simply dropped off, as it happens, at the

 4   30th Street Men's Shelter in my district.    We

 5   have seen an enormous growth in populations

 6   just being dropped off with nothing.

 7         What can OTDA do to ensure that DOCCS

 8   is not simply busing people into a

 9   nonsolution?    Which is going to increase

10   their likelihood of ending up right back in

11   DOCCS anyway.

12         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:     Sure.   Again,

13   we all recognize the importance of and the

14   value of proper housing and strategies for

15   release and why that's so important to reduce

16   recidivism and how that can be effective.

17         I've also seen firsthand the

18   30th Street Shelter in full operation and

19   recognize the value that that particular

20   facility provides in the system, and note

21   areas for improvement as well.

22         That said, it is imperative that the

23   state agencies all collaborate.   And we work

24   together now, but there always is room for
                                                           177

 1   improvement to be able to make sure that

 2   whether it's DOCCS or OTDA or any other

 3   different portion, different agencies are

 4   collaborating to make sure that we don't find

 5   that situation where an individual is dropped

 6   off and the chances for success are extremely

 7   limited.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Are you operating

 9   under any MOUs today?     I found some pretty

10   old ones.

11         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      There are

12   some old ones.   And we are --

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Can you get those

14   to me, please, after the hearing?

15         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      Of course.

16         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

17         And again, you heard me when I asked

18   Sheila Poole from OCFS.    I would also like to

19   see the same information, because --

20         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:      They are

21   working on it as we speak.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Excellent.     Thank

23   you very much for your testimony today.

24         I believe the Senate is done,
                                                            178

 1   Assembly.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:        So that

 3   concludes the questions for you,

 4   Commissioner.    Thank you so much.    And we

 5   look forward to some of the follow-ups that

 6   you've committed to.

 7         OTDA COMMISSIONER HEIN:       Thank you

 8   very much.    And thank you all.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next we will be

10   hearing from New York State Office for the

11   Aging, Greg Olsen, acting director.

12         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:       You guys ready

13   for me?

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Feel free to --

15   well, wait one second.   People are just --

16   actually, leaving very quietly.       So, Greg,

17   you can begin.

18         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:       Thank you.

19   Well, good afternoon.    It's always a pleasure

20   to be here.

21         Chairpersons Krueger, Weinstein,

22   Chairpersons May, Bronson and all the

23   distinguished members of the Assembly and

24   standing committees, I'm Greg Olsen.         I'm the
                                                        179

 1   acting director of the New York State Office

 2   for the Aging.   And as always, I'm always

 3   honored to testify on the portions of

 4   Governor Cuomo's proposed budget that affect

 5   older New Yorkers.

 6         Governor Cuomo's commitment to older

 7   New Yorkers is unprecedented, and New York is

 8   viewed across the nation as a trailblazer for

 9   the work that we're doing to support older

10   adults through the Office for the Aging.     Our

11   approach is so much broader than one agency.

12   It's about making New York the healthiest

13   state in the nation through a multi-agency

14   coordinated focused effort on improving

15   physical and behavioral health, implementing

16   preventive healthcare strategies, embedding

17   healthy aging principles into planning,

18   procurement and policies to change the built

19   environment, and much more.

20         Utilizing the state's 2019-2024

21   Prevention Agenda as the umbrella, and

22   instituting a "health across all policies"

23   approach, all New York State agencies are

24   incorporating health considerations into our
                                                       180

 1   planning, our programs, and our initiatives.

 2   We have been charged to work together and

 3   consider how all of our policies further our

 4   efforts as the first age-friendly state in

 5   the nation.    This approach will have and is

 6   having a significant positive impact on

 7   New York's older population.

 8         Under the Governor's leadership,

 9   New York State became the first state in the

10   nation to receive the age-friendly

11   designation by the AARP and the World Health

12   Organization because we ranked high in the

13   eight domains of age-friendly, livable

14   communities.   But more importantly, we have a

15   comprehensive plan to systematically build

16   age-friendly and smart growth principles into

17   how government operates and functions.    We're

18   truly leading the nation in this

19   collaborative and thoughtful approach.

20         The fiscal year '20-'21 Executive

21   Budget continues its ongoing commitment to

22   older New Yorkers.   It includes:   The

23   continuation of the historic $15 million

24   targeted investment that was contained in
                                                     181

 1   last year's enacted budget to assist those

 2   who are awaiting services in our network.

 3   And I want to thank you all for your support

 4   of that historic investment.

 5         The continuation of $1.5 million to

 6   the CSE program that was contained in last

 7   year's enacted budget.

 8         The continued support for the New York

 9   Connects systems reform, which exceeds

10   $20 million annually to help individuals of

11   all ages and payors access long-term services

12   and supports.

13         Maintaining our $500,000 funding

14   stream that draws down an additional

15   $2 million to support our enhanced multi

16   disciplinary teams to combat elder abuse and

17   financial exploitation.

18         Provisions by the Governor to lower

19   prescription drug prices, which will have a

20   significant impact on older adults.

21         And maintaining all core funding

22   levels from last year.

23         The 2021 Executive Budget proposal

24   will continue to help hundreds of thousands
                                                       182

 1   of older New Yorkers maintain their

 2   independence, support their loved ones who

 3   care for them, reduce future Medicaid costs,

 4   and further demonstrate why New York is the

 5   first-age friendly state in the nation.

 6            The State Office for the Aging and our

 7   network does not stop there.    We can't stop

 8   there.    In order to meet emerging goals, we

 9   need to do a lot more together, and that's

10   exactly what we do.

11            Through innovative partnerships with

12   foundations, state and community partners,

13   and our own efforts, we are expanding

14   services and testing new delivery models.

15   These include advancing our state

16   age-friendly work via grants to help

17   communities replicate the Governor's signed

18   Executive Order 190 at the county level;

19   bringing new municipalities into AARP's

20   age-friendly network; standing up, first in

21   the country, five Age-Friendly Regional

22   Technical Assistance Centers that are being

23   led by the New York Academy of Medicine and

24   creating a learning collaborative to assure
                                                       183

 1   the success of our grantees in the short-term

 2   and then an expansion, hopefully, in the

 3   long-term.

 4            Implementing our private-pay program

 5   as a result of receiving the statutory

 6   authority in last year's enacted budget --

 7   again, I thank you for that support.    Working

 8   with the PPS systems and health plans and

 9   providers around the state to purchase

10   services from our network that address the

11   social determinants of health.    Significantly

12   expanding our state certification and

13   skills-based trainings for staff who deliver

14   services across the state.    Expanding our

15   partnership with the Office of Temporary and

16   Disability Assistance to provide targeted

17   nutrition counseling and nutrition education

18   in low-income targeted areas across the

19   state.

20            Working with the Village to Village

21   network and the Albany Guardian Society to

22   seed local village movements that organize

23   neighbors to help neighbors, and stood up the

24   first-in-the-nation regional Village to
                                                      184

 1   Village Technical Assistance Center right

 2   here in the Capital District.

 3           Participating in a statewide

 4   collaborative to educate the public on the

 5   devastating impacts of sepsis.   Reducing

 6   social isolation via the use of animatronic

 7   pets.   Working with the New York State

 8   Council on the Arts to bring arts and arts

 9   education to senior centers and libraries in

10   three regions of the state, which will help

11   improve health, reduce social isolation,

12   improve cognitive functioning, and support

13   professional artists.

14           Working to better understand the

15   fiscal impact that caregiving has on the

16   public and private workforce as well as the

17   healthcare costs for those caregivers in the

18   work environment.   And working with the DDPC,

19   the Developmental Disabilities Planning

20   Council, to provide training and education

21   resources that will help us better serve

22   individuals with disabilities who are

23   entering our service infrastructure.

24           So we'll continue to engage all the
                                                        185

 1   state agencies, our private partners,

 2   not-for-profits and other community-based

 3   organizations to serve New York's older

 4   population as effectively as we can.

 5           As always, always appreciative to be

 6   here, and I'm happy to take any questions

 7   that you may have.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 9           So we go to Assemblyman Bronson, chair

10   of our Aging Committee.

11           ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Thank you,

12   Chairperson Weinstein.

13           Acting Director Olsen, thanks for

14   being here.

15           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    My pleasure.

16           ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    It's always a

17   pleasure working with you.      And I do want to

18   credit the Governor and your office for your

19   commitment to older New Yorkers and the type

20   of work that we've been able to do.

21           The $15 million increase in

22   community-based services last year was huge.

23   And I -- my first question is actually about

24   that.   And, you know, we were trying to
                                                       186

 1   address the waitlist.    At your request, we

 2   offered some flexibility in how those funds

 3   were distributed county by county.

 4         So my question is twofold.     First,

 5   were all counties able to participate?     And

 6   if not, which ones didn't and what was the

 7   reason for that?    And then, second, if you

 8   have an estimate of the number of people on

 9   the waitlist that we were able to provide

10   services to.

11         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Sure.   Thank

12   you, Assemblyman, and Senator May.    You know,

13   you guys came in last year, and that was

14   really a historic investment we hadn't seen

15   in over 20 years.

16         I think what was key about that

17   proposal -- which you all supported -- was

18   that flexibility in bypassing our traditional

19   funding formula.    That's how dollars go out

20   the door.   It's based on the percentage of

21   people over the age of 60 by county gets a

22   certain percent of the dollars.   And that

23   model works effectively well for a lot of our

24   programs.
                                                       187

 1         But you know, as you mentioned, what's

 2   reported back to us in terms of unmet needs

 3   doesn't necessarily follow the traditional

 4   formula.   So what we were able to negotiate

 5   with you all last year was the ability to

 6   bypass that, get resources directly to the

 7   communities that reported back.   Hence, the

 8   $15 million.

 9         So out of the 59 county-based area

10   agencies on aging that are part of our

11   network, 50 of them reported unmet need.    And

12   so those resources were directed towards

13   those communities.

14         For some of the nine who did not

15   report, I don't necessarily view that as

16   something that they didn't do right.   What

17   that says to me is that with their federal,

18   state and local resources, the contributions

19   that they may get from the residents who are

20   receiving service, their own fundraising,

21   that they're able to meet the current need.

22   That's a success story.

23         I will tell you that a few of the

24   counties who did not report unmet need --
                                                        188

 1   which we've been receiving information for

 2   quite a long time in terms of what that looks

 3   like -- did have middle-of-the-year issues,

 4   and we were able to redirect some resources

 5   to them.

 6         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Okay.   And thank

 7   you for that work.    It's really important for

 8   our older New Yorkers and their families.

 9         What happens if someone is on a

10   wait -- well, let me back up.    First of all,

11   you know, I have information to suggest that

12   there's significantly increased numbers of

13   waitlists, upwards of 9,700.    And, you know,

14   we need to quantify that and get a real

15   number.    But when someone is on a waitlist,

16   what happens to them?    If they're not getting

17   those services they need to age at home, what

18   happens to them?

19         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     So there's a

20   lot of different things that could

21   potentially happen.    So we have a policy that

22   we put in place in 2014 that targets people

23   who may be awaiting services that, if through

24   their own resources or through a family
                                                          189

 1   member or friends, can private-pay while

 2   they're working their way up that service

 3   category.

 4           What we look at first, though, is the

 5   acuity level of the need.   And so individuals

 6   who are not receiving services due to

 7   adequate funding are prioritized based on

 8   some factors, right, their income level,

 9   geography, their functional limitations.       And

10   so, you know, they would receive a priority

11   over other people who may not be receiving

12   services.

13           But because you may not be receiving

14   services through us doesn't mean that there's

15   not an effort underway by the area agencies

16   and the community-based partners to connect

17   them with other community resources.    So I

18   say that because we're not the only game in

19   town.   We're an important conduit to really

20   look holistically and person-centered at an

21   individual and what they may or may not need.

22   But there are a variety of other entities at

23   the local level from town and municipality

24   programs, CAP agencies, you know, the
                                                      190

 1   United Way, those types of things that offer

 2   similar types of services that we can connect

 3   to.

 4         Some are case-managed while they're

 5   awaiting services.   We can look at things

 6   like are they receiving SNAP benefits, try to

 7   hook them up with SNAP and HEAP and

 8   low-income subsidy to put money back in their

 9   pockets to get connected to services.

10         So it's not like they just languish

11   while they're waiting.   The area agencies are

12   very adept at capitalizing and leveraging

13   their community resources, because that

14   really is how the network is structured.

15         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Yeah, I

16   appreciate that.   And the network is very

17   good, it's important to do those evaluations,

18   those assessments, and try to get to the

19   high-needs people as quickly as possible.

20         But if we don't get them the

21   community-based needs, you know, they -- some

22   go into, you know, nursing homes, others go

23   into other forms of managed long-term care.

24   And those costs are astronomical.   And the
                                                    191

 1   state is currently facing a Medicaid issue.

 2   Yet we have services to keep people at home,

 3   where the annual cost is around, you know,

 4   $6,000, $6,300 -- yet the cost of a nursing

 5   home is $150,000 annually.

 6         You know, we don't have to discuss

 7   this in detail, but I think through budget

 8   negotiations what I'd like your office to be

 9   involved in, as we look at the Medicaid

10   Redesign Team No. 2 and the parameters that

11   are set out there, if we could also ask

12   them -- and with your assistance -- to look

13   at if we invest more in keeping people at

14   home, can we save money on the Medicaid side

15   of the equation?

16         And with that -- $15 million last

17   year -- I'd be willing to advocate for more

18   money for those services so that we can save

19   that money at the Medicaid end.

20         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Yeah, and I

21   think what you just recognized and have

22   recognized, with the support of the

23   investment last year, is similar to what the

24   Governor and the Health Department
                                                        192

 1   recognized.     You know, would $15 million come

 2   out of the global Medicaid cap.    I'm sure

 3   that -- you know, going back to Senator

 4   Krueger's -- the model, what's an effective

 5   model that might be less expensive, you know,

 6   I think that this will be talked about

 7   through budget negotiations.     You know, our

 8   network is able to intervene a lot earlier

 9   than the medical model, and that's by design.

10   And we should have a system like that that

11   focuses attention on the front end in the

12   community, waiting -- you know, not waiting

13   for people to devolve to a point where you

14   need those higher levels of care.

15         So I think that $15 million investment

16   came from exactly those facts, that we can

17   target people who are at imminent risk of

18   Medicaid and spend-down, and help serve them

19   and their families in their homes and

20   communities for quite some time.    Hence, the

21   investment.

22         So I'm hopeful that this will be a

23   conversation that will play itself out during

24   negotiations.
                                                         193

 1         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     I am also

 2   hopeful.

 3         I've had conversations with you

 4   recently, along with your staff, in

 5   connection with nursing home transfers and

 6   evictions, and its relationship to the Long

 7   Term Care Ombudsman Program.    The Comptroller

 8   had issued a report toward the end of last

 9   year about these types of transfers and, you

10   know, what we could be doing to prevent this

11   disruption to folks who are in these

12   facilities and make sure that they're getting

13   the notice that they're required under

14   federal law and things of that nature.

15         Can you expand on this a little bit?

16   What's happening with our Long Term Care

17   Ombudsman Program and its effectiveness, and

18   how could we be more effective?

19         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, that's a

20   great question.

21         So the program on its whole -- we

22   could talk a little bit about that for a

23   second.    You know, we regionalized a couple

24   of years ago for economies of scale.       We had
                                                      194

 1   several programs that were very, very small.

 2   It's difficult to run a county program, you

 3   know, when you're receiving $15,000,

 4   especially to complete the functions that the

 5   program provides.

 6         And so what it does is really the

 7   quality control eyes and ears in facilities

 8   to help individuals make sure that their

 9   rights are maintained and that they're

10   receiving quality of care.

11         The eviction issue has been one that

12   we've been working with the Health Department

13   on to develop a process in order to, first,

14   make sure that people know what their rights

15   are in terms of the eviction, and then how to

16   go through an appeals process.   I'd be happy

17   to share, you know, what that process is in

18   writing with you, but that's something that

19   we are working on.

20         In terms of the ombudsman program

21   itself, you know, it's a challenge.    We have

22   a fairly large cadre of staff around the

23   state, 35 full-time, 10 part-time, a little

24   over 400 volunteers.   So I think what we're
                                                      195

 1   seeing both within LTCOP and within our

 2   Health Information Counseling Assistance

 3   Program, and probably elsewhere in other

 4   systems, is the face of the volunteer is

 5   changing.

 6         You know, these types of programs

 7   require a four-day intensive certification in

 8   order to become an ombudsman.   The task is

 9   pretty intense, and you've got to give a lot

10   of credit to these folks that are putting in

11   20 hours a week.   But the bottom line is that

12   the face of volunteers are changing.    People

13   are spending less time doing the day-to-day

14   volunteering and more, you know, the weekend

15   warrior type of thing once or twice a year,

16   which is perfectly fine.   But it certainly

17   has an impact on the programs and services

18   that we provide.

19         So we've tested a couple of things

20   over the last year, and I think I mentioned

21   this in last year's hearing.    You know, we

22   looked at implementing a $75 a month stipend

23   in the LTCOP program in four regions to see

24   if that would have an impact on retention,
                                                       196

 1   training, and the amount of work that you

 2   would get out by providing a small stipend.

 3   And it's been very, very successful.      So

 4   that's something we're looking to potentially

 5   expand a little bit more, which would help us

 6   with the workload, which makes us able to go

 7   to more places and do the same thing with the

 8   HICAP program.

 9            ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Okay.   So,

10   again, I'd like to continue to work with you

11   regarding, you know, methodologies that we

12   can better recruit and retain volunteers as

13   well as paid folks in this area.      And I'll

14   defer and ask you questions on my second

15   round.

16            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Okay, thank

17   you.

18            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

19            Senate?

20            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Aging Chair

21   Senator Rachel May.

22            SENATOR MAY:   Thank you.   Thank you.

23            And thank you, Commissioner.    It's

24   been a pleasure working with you over the
                                                       197

 1   last year.

 2         Let me help out my colleague here,

 3   because I was going to ask about the ombuds

 4   program as well.    Have you considered a

 5   travel allowance for the volunteers?    Because

 6   certainly in our part of the state they have

 7   to go long distances often.

 8         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, many of

 9   them have that -- have an allowance built in,

10   so that that type of thing should not be on

11   the backs of the volunteers.

12         What I like about the -- you know,

13   what I like about the stipend idea is it's a

14   low-budget, high-yield impact.    It recognizes

15   the value that these folks bring to the table

16   every single day.    It's something that's

17   pretty complicated and not always positive if

18   you're seeing, you know, things that you

19   don't want to be seeing in some of these

20   facilities.

21         And, you know, I think that on the

22   receiving side from the volunteer, in

23   addition to all the other recognition things

24   that the program does -- and the support that
                                                      198

 1   we try to provide in various other areas

 2   really is monumental in terms of them feeling

 3   valued for the time commitment that they put

 4   into this.

 5         So we're certainly not averse to any

 6   of those types of incentives that are going

 7   to help not only, again, recruit people, but

 8   make sure once they're in and feel that it's

 9   a volunteer experience that's important to

10   them, that we hang onto them.

11         SENATOR MAY:   Okay, great.

12         So let me go back to these issues

13   about keeping people in their homes and out

14   of nursing homes.   And the first question is,

15   in the MRT process do you anticipate having a

16   voice in what gets decided?   And do you think

17   that community-based programs that serve the

18   elderly will have any kind of input into that

19   process?

20         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    You know, I do

21   think we will be -- always are and will be

22   interacting with our Health Department

23   colleagues.   And I think that Dr. Zucker and

24   Donna Frescatore mentioned that yesterday.
                                                       199

 1           I think because -- the way that we

 2   kind of view our role in concert with the

 3   Health Department is that we do have a

 4   continuum of care.     We're the front end of

 5   that.   We are pre-Medicaid.    We're trying to

 6   keep people out of the emergency room.     You

 7   need a strong community-based network to be

 8   discharged safely back to the community.

 9           So there's always going to be a

10   positive interaction between those two

11   things.   I don't think it should be lost on

12   any of us that that investment we got last

13   year came from the Health Department's budget

14   because they recognized that we are able to

15   target certain individuals that eventually

16   could wind their way into the Medicaid

17   program, that we can do it for very, very low

18   cost, hence what the investment is.

19           So I feel confident moving forward

20   that some of the things that our network may

21   be able to offer will be part of that

22   conversation.

23           SENATOR MAY:    Thank you.   So that

24   $15 million investment last year was
                                                       200

 1   predicated on a savings of about $34 million

 2   from Medicaid in keeping people out of

 3   nursing homes.   Have you run the numbers?

 4   Are you seeing that kind of savings, or is it

 5   too early to tell?

 6           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Well, I think,

 7   you know, what we did do is we were able to

 8   tag future Medicaid savings.     Because if

 9   you're receiving services in our network, you

10   are not receiving services somewhere else.

11           So, you know, we began the process

12   with some assumptions based on some feedback

13   from the area agencies that reported what

14   happens to people if they're awaiting

15   services and not getting them.     I think what

16   we have a little more definitively at this

17   point -- I think our reporting requirement

18   that we had agreed to in the budget last year

19   is September, so I'll know a lot more by

20   then.

21           But I can tell you this.   I asked 10

22   of the counties fairly recently to go through

23   some of their client data of folks who were

24   awaiting services when they reported it back
                                                       201

 1   in the '17-'18 cycle, which predated the

 2   $15 million, to the time that we were able to

 3   release the money based on the enacted

 4   budget, what happened to those folks.    And so

 5   they went through 2200 individual case files,

 6   which is a monumental labor-intensive

 7   process, and I appreciated that they did

 8   that.

 9           And I think Assemblyman Bronson hit it

10   on the nose.   Those numbers are similar to

11   what we found:   10 percent went directly from

12   awaiting services into a nursing home.    So

13   that would have had a cost.   Because, again,

14   the clients that we're serving are

15   traditionally 83-year-old females who live

16   alone, are low-income, have four or more

17   chronic conditions, and have three needs

18   in -- you know, functional needs in a variety

19   of different areas.    So they're pretty much

20   at risk.

21           So again, I think that the investment

22   speaks for itself.

23           SENATOR MAY:   Thank you.

24           So like Assemblyman Bronson, I -- it
                                                     202

 1   makes me wonder why we don't just multiply

 2   the investment by 10 and reap, you know, that

 3   much more in terms of the savings.

 4         So I'm interested in a few things

 5   where I feel like we're kind of

 6   nickel-and-diming our home care system.

 7   There's not a COLA in there again.   We are

 8   deferring the cost-of-living adjustment yet

 9   again, which makes it harder to find people

10   to do the work of home care.

11         I didn't see if there was an increase

12   in funding for NORCs, but that's a way that

13   we support -- a pretty low-cost way of

14   supporting seniors in their homes.   The

15   affordable senior housing service

16   coordinators are -- what I'm told is they

17   save about $4,000 per person per

18   hospitalization, helping them, you know,

19   coordinate everything more easily.   The

20   Senior Companion Program that we have out in

21   Onondaga County, where seniors are going and

22   just visiting with isolated seniors, and it's

23   great for both the volunteers and the people

24   receiving those services.   Data systems for
                                                       203

 1   senior centers to connect with hospitals for

 2   discharge planning so people aren't missing

 3   meals, home-delivered meals or that kind of

 4   thing.

 5            So tell me about all of these areas:

 6   Is there room for further investment in these

 7   in order to save a lot of money on the

 8   Medicaid side of things?

 9            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Yeah, and I

10   think you mentioned a lot of very important

11   programs that are part of a much bigger

12   coordinated system.    And that's why, again,

13   you know, when we're going through the

14   private-pay protocols -- and what we want to

15   do to try to get people to the front door of

16   the Office for the Aging.   And they're not

17   looking at one particular program, they're

18   looking holistically.    It's a person-centered

19   approach looking at the individual and what

20   do they need, what are their strengths, what

21   other things can we leverage.

22            So I think that those things are very

23   important.    It's very difficult at times to

24   get people to accept services, but that's the
                                                     204

 1   culture that we live in.   And our job is to

 2   make sure that we're out there in the

 3   communities letting people know that there

 4   are a variety of things they may be eligible

 5   for that they're not receiving that we can

 6   help them with.

 7         I think what's the most promising

 8   thing -- and, you know, now being in this

 9   network for 27 years, what's happened over

10   the last couple of years, at least where

11   aging is concerned, to me is very exciting:

12   The focus on value-based payments, shared

13   savings with Medicare, with Medicare allowing

14   services to be paid for that address the

15   social determinants of health -- all of those

16   things that we do very well in our network.

17         And so we've had some very, very

18   productive conversations lately with Emblem,

19   with Excellus, with the Albany PPS, with the

20   Adirondack Health Institute, that are looking

21   for ways not to recreate the wheel.   And

22   that's where we fit in.

23         We've got a network that's been around

24   for 50 years that has, again, 59 offices for
                                                     205

 1   the aging, 1200 community-based contractors

 2   that provide a variety of services that you

 3   just talked about, as well as, you know,

 4   800 congregate sites, 2400 home-delivered-

 5   meal routes.   There's a lot that we can be

 6   doing in looking to diversify our funding,

 7   whether it be through private pay, Medicare

 8   contracts, others, to significantly expand

 9   service to do exactly the kinds of things

10   that you and Assemblyman Bronson have

11   mentioned.

12         SENATOR MAY:    Thank you.

13         And then the last thing is to talk

14   about what's my top priority legislatively,

15   and I believe Assemblyman Bronson's as well,

16   which is the Family Caregiver Tax Credit.

17   Which is partly just a recognition of all the

18   work that families do, but it's also intended

19   to make it easier for more families to do

20   that kind of care and plug the gap in terms

21   of the lack of the home healthcare workforce,

22   and also to help people stay in their homes

23   so they're not going into nursing homes.

24         So if that didn't make it into the
                                                       206

 1   budget, is that something that you're willing

 2   to advocate for?   We feel that that's very

 3   important.    AARP does.   It's potentially a

 4   really valuable thing in terms of return on

 5   investment, I believe.

 6         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, and

 7   there's been a lot of conversations about the

 8   tax credit.    So I'm sure again, as we move

 9   forward, that will -- that's not going to be

10   the last time it comes up.

11         I can tell you, one of the things I'm

12   proudest about in the state is the caregiver

13   investments that have not only been made in

14   our agency, but also in the Health

15   Department.    I think one of the most exciting

16   things what we're working on currently --

17   I'll just quickly share with you -- is I

18   think we get a lot bigger bang for the buck

19   when we can show what the impact of

20   caregiving is to the economic bottom line.

21         So we are working now with AARP

22   nationally, AARP New York State, Emblem, the

23   New York State Health Department and Excellus

24   to do a really comprehensive study of the
                                                       207

 1   impact of caregiving on state employees,

 2   county employees, and then maybe the

 3   20 biggest businesses in New York State.     We

 4   have the ability through some health

 5   insurers, Emblem and Excellus, to look at

 6   claims data.   What's the impact on

 7   healthcare, healthcare spending of

 8   caregivers?    What does it cost businesses in

 9   terms of turnover, lost productivity?   We

10   know the wage reductions for women, which is

11   a huge problem.

12         So I think that, you know,

13   collectively the impetus behind getting data

14   like that is really going to be an

15   eye-opener, not only at the state level and

16   the county level, but also through private

17   businesses, where then we can be working

18   together to provide strategies that not only

19   help identify who caregivers are, because

20   that's the number-one problem, but also

21   connect them to the myriad of services that

22   we have in New York State.    We have over

23   76,000 respite and caregiver programs at the

24   community level that people, you know, use
                                                         208

 1   but may not know about, because a lot of this

 2   is crisis-driven, as you know.

 3         SENATOR MAY:    Great.   Thank you.    Is

 4   there a date for when that report will be

 5   coming?

 6         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     It's going to

 7   be this year.   I mean, we are moving quickly

 8   and there's a lot of excitement.       It's going

 9   to be not only a great assist to New York

10   State, but it will become a national model to

11   really hone in on this at the state level

12   everywhere, because it matters, as you know,.

13         SENATOR MAY:   Great.    Thank you.

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

15         We go to Assemblywoman Wright.

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:      Good afternoon.

17         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Hi.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Hi.    I do want

19   to first acknowledge that there are some very

20   good outcomes in my community related to the

21   age-friendly program, and we recently

22   designated a NORC, and so we're able to

23   further support our aging community with

24   those things.
                                                       209

 1            However, I am finding and hearing and

 2   getting complaints in my office that the

 3   problem really centers upon -- elder abuse is

 4   really centered upon the abuses that exist

 5   because those who we believe are supposed to

 6   be helping our elders have too many gaps in

 7   the systems and regulations that govern their

 8   operations and allow abuse to occur.

 9            So I do want to ask, first, how much

10   influence, oversight, do you have on adult

11   day care centers?

12            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   You want me

13   to --

14            ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:    Yeah.

15            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Okay.   Sure.

16            So there -- I'm going to answer that

17   two ways, because there's two different

18   oversight entities.    There are the social

19   adult day centers that we operate directly,

20   so we contract with directly.     We have 13 of

21   those.    And so those are required to, you

22   know, meet the state standards, which are

23   actually in our regulations.

24            The area agencies on aging themselves
                                                     210

 1   operate or contract with another 83 social

 2   adult day -- same thing, they're mandated to

 3   be monitored annually, we have monitoring

 4   tools, et cetera.

 5           Then there are those that are

 6   receiving Medicaid funds.    That's under the

 7   jurisdiction of the Health Department and

 8   their Managed Long Term Care contracts, and

 9   they are required to be certified through

10   OMIG.   So there are about 330 of them in

11   New York City that would fall into the Health

12   Department MLTC oversight.

13           Our role in that is to make sure that

14   the plans that the SADC programs that we

15   don't oversee directly, that everybody

16   understands what the regs are, the types of

17   things that they're supposed to do in

18   monitoring.   We've provided some tools, some

19   self-monitoring tools.   They all have to --

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:   May I ask, do

21   you monitor what type of information they're

22   allowed to collect regarding the people who

23   attend the facility and what they're able to

24   do with the information that they collect?
                                                         211

 1           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    So I can only

 2   speak to the little over a hundred that we

 3   touch directly.   The ones that are, excuse

 4   me, touched by the -- overseen by the Health

 5   Department, the MLTC plans, I can't speak to

 6   that.

 7           But we certainly do have, you know,

 8   HIPAA and a public -- we definitely have

 9   requirements in terms of not sharing public

10   health information or personal information.

11           ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:     Not health

12   information, just total information that

13   they're able to collect and what they're able

14   to do with that information.

15           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Let me look at

16   the regs.   I don't think that there is

17   something that our programs are particularly

18   sharing with anybody.    But let me -- I want

19   to make sure I answer that correctly.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN   WRIGHT:   Okay.   And I'm

21   imagining the local departments of aging and

22   protective services for the aging or elderly

23   in the municipalities, you have -- do you

24   have oversight or is it just partnership?
                                                     212

 1         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Yeah, so the

 2   area agencies -- so in this regard, DFTA, New

 3   York City Department for the Aging, again, if

 4   they're contracting with social adult day

 5   programs -- which they are -- using the

 6   funding that we have, then they're required

 7   to follow the same monitoring schedule that

 8   we require of ours.   And they do do that.

 9         And as you know, that DFTA is also --

10   runs a social adult day ombudsman program

11   where they field complaints from all the SADC

12   programs.

13         Of course if they're theirs, they

14   would go out and do that monitoring

15   themselves.   If they're not, and they're

16   attached to a Medicare dollar, those

17   complaints go to my office, they go to the

18   Health Department, and they go to the Office

19   of Medicaid Inspector General, where then

20   they will look into and make the appropriate

21   actions or correct the action plan.

22         ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:    And then I

23   guess the last thing I want to leave -- I

24   think it's more of a statement than a
                                                         213

 1   question -- is that what I'm finding are

 2   those that are supposed to be protecting our

 3   older community are actually working to

 4   undermine the world that those people have

 5   created for themselves when they become

 6   vulnerable or in need of assistance.      Instead

 7   of fortifying the connections that they've

 8   built around them, they work very diligently

 9   to pull them apart.

10           I'm finding that we have too much

11   attention and strong-handed responses when

12   the alleged victim of abuse is single, a

13   woman, and childless.   I have a case that has

14   come to my office where after nine months

15   of -- one, they broke down the door to get

16   in.   Then they put it -- it was in the court

17   case.   After nine months of adjournments, the

18   first time my office misses an opportunity to

19   show up in that courtroom, they make a

20   decision that she's incapacitated.   Within

21   two months, she's in a nursing home, although

22   she's been living independently all before

23   this.   And during the nine months that

24   they've been involved, she did not have
                                                       214

 1   anyone bring even food to her home.   She's

 2   two months into the nursing home, and then

 3   within a month after that, both of her homes

 4   are up for sale and guardians are being paid.

 5         I think your office needs to pay

 6   attention to what's going on in New York

 7   City, because it's a problem.

 8         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, and I

 9   know you were making a statement; I think

10   that's a great statement.    There's a lot of

11   work that our agency does, not only in

12   coordinating and administering the state's

13   enhanced multidisciplinary team, but working

14   with the city Elder Abuse Coalition and

15   others -- but again, others across the state.

16         Look, we are in a culture now where a

17   lot of people have no idea who's living next

18   door to them.   You know, people don't talk to

19   their neighbors anymore.    I know that the

20   Governor had proposed some additional

21   measures to combat financial exploitation

22   within the budget this year.    There are a lot

23   of touch points that, regardless of how

24   isolated the older person is, they're going
                                                        215

 1   to see somebody, whether it be a physician or

 2   it be in the ER.

 3           We're doing a lot of work in terms of

 4   trying to make sure that those different

 5   touch points can understand what the signs

 6   and symptoms are of physical and other types

 7   of elder abuse, but also on the financial

 8   part.

 9           So what I would love to do is, you

10   know, follow up with you on all the things

11   that we are doing.   And if there's things

12   that we're not doing, to have you advise us

13   on that would be very helpful.

14           ASSEMBLYWOMAN WRIGHT:    Thank you.

15           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

16           Senate?

17           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

18           So hi.

19           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    How are you,

20   Senator?

21           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Fine, thank you.

22           So I'm always amazed with how small

23   your agency is, given that the population of

24   New York State trends to older and older.
                                                      216

 1   That's going to be a discussion for another

 2   day.

 3          It's a huge population over a 30-year

 4   age framework.   So there are issues for the

 5   frail elderly and those who need home care.

 6   I'm going to say -- and nursing home

 7   questions.   The number-one issues that come

 8   to my district office for older New Yorkers

 9   are discrimination -- discrimination pushing

10   them out of the workforce when they hit a

11   certain age, discrimination in refusing to

12   consider them for hiring, even though one of

13   the realities of living much longer than

14   everyone estimated is that they need more

15   money because they're living longer.   And yet

16   they can't go back to work because there

17   seems to be a consistent pattern of

18   discrimination against seniors when they try

19   to get jobs.

20          Discrimination of even -- I always

21   find this is interesting.   Medicare is the

22   healthcare program for seniors.   At least in

23   my district -- and we're doing a survey, and

24   I'm wondering whether your agency might
                                                      217

 1   consider taking on a similar survey --

 2   doctors don't want to take Medicare patients.

 3         UNIDENTIFIED MEMBER:   Mm-hmm.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    I heard that

 5   "uh-huh."   Well, yup, it's not just me.    So

 6   we need to do something about that.    I know

 7   Medicare is a federal law.   But a couple of

 8   things.

 9         One, if they're not taking seniors,

10   somehow we're both flunking the test.    And

11   two, just FYI, if you can't get services

12   through Medicare and you're a lower-income

13   senior, you're going to line up to get

14   Medicaid, and that was yesterday's

15   conversation, that we have too many people on

16   Medicaid and it's an issue for our budget.

17   So we need to make sure that we as the State

18   of New York are maximizing the ability for

19   our older New Yorkers to actually draw down

20   correctly on Medicare services.

21         But if everybody is confirming what I

22   thought -- I was starting to think, oh, it's

23   only me in my district, that nobody wants to

24   take on Medicare patients -- I just think
                                                       218

 1   this is huge.

 2         So, one, I ask you to look into and

 3   perhaps do surveys, because that's what we're

 4   doing, about -- you know, we actually just go

 5   through the medical referral lists and find

 6   out -- because you can do it by computer --

 7   how many are taking Medicare for new

 8   patients.   And you find there's nobody.     Or

 9   in Manhattan, you can find seven.   Seven.

10   That's not the exact number, but that small.

11         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Yeah, that's

12   crazy, right.

13         (Cellphone sound.)

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     That's crazy.

15         So I really think we have to do

16   something about this.   And we have to do a

17   lot more to ensure that we put systems in

18   place that are making sure -- I don't know

19   who's ringing --

20         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    I just want to

21   make sure it's not me --

22         (Laughter.)

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     It's not me.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Somebody's mic
                                                     219

 1   and phone are on.

 2           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   -- that this

 3   growth of discrimination in employment as

 4   well.   And I'm wondering whether you have

 5   seen anything or been able to do anything

 6   about that.

 7           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Yeah, so on

 8   your second point, you know, you'll be

 9   hearing from the Association on Aging in

10   New York State.   That might be something in

11   terms of the physician networks, and that's

12   something we could potentially work on

13   together.   I think that's really important,

14   and I agree.

15           You know, the discrimination side,

16   Senator, I feel exactly the same way you do.

17   And I think if you look at the kinds of

18   things that our agency has been talking about

19   for the last seven years or so, is really to

20   try to combat ageism stereotypes and the

21   discrimination.   And we do that a number of

22   different ways.

23           I mean, we all -- we know how we grow

24   up in this country, we know how the media
                                                      220

 1   portrays older people.   We know how cartoons

 2   do it, to start it with our kids.   People are

 3   scared to get older.   It's an age -- you

 4   know, young-age type of environment that we

 5   live in.

 6            But I think when you start to

 7   aggregate the facts of what older adults mean

 8   to their families, to their communities --

 9   the biggest bloc of entrepreneurs, biggest

10   givers to philanthropy, largest volunteer

11   group, hold 83 percent of the nation's

12   wealth, support 90 million jobs, are

13   43 percent of the federal tax base, same at

14   the state and local level, in New York State

15   represent 63 percent of all the personal

16   income generated, and the thousand of years

17   of work life and voluntary experience that

18   you have -- you know, we're in competition

19   with other states because they recognize the

20   value of this population, have built it into

21   their economic development, you know, talking

22   points as ways to get older adults from the

23   Northeast to move out of New York and go

24   there.
                                                      221

 1         Hence the whole effort around

 2   age-friendly.   I mean, for us that's a

 3   couple -- there's two reasons to do that.

 4   One is to try to stop people from going to

 5   New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida.   And the

 6   other is to make New York State the type of

 7   community that people want to move to.

 8         So we are currently working on a

 9   campaign to do a little bit more on the media

10   side in terms of ageism and discrimination.

11   And Assemblyman Bronson and I have talked as

12   recently as Tuesday on looking at some ways

13   we can address the workforce, have an

14   age-friendly workforce.   You know, dispel

15   some of those myths that they cost more in

16   health insurance -- they don't.    That they

17   won't learn computers -- they will.    That

18   they're not reliable -- yes, they are.     And

19   so I think collectively we all have a role to

20   do that, and that's really the basis of what

21   an age-friendly state does.   It tells the

22   truth, it raises these issues and tries to

23   solve them.

24         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.
                                                      222

 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Assemblyman

 2   Bronson.

 3         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Thank you.

 4         So let's follow up on older

 5   New Yorkers in the workplace.    And as you

 6   just indicated, we've had conversations about

 7   this this week, actually.

 8         And as an employment lawyer by trade,

 9   I'm well aware of the discrimination that

10   happens on the basis of age as well as other

11   factors, and so education and awareness is

12   definitely an element to this.

13         But I think we also need to think

14   creatively.   As we're looking at what we do

15   with the gig economy in this budget, as we

16   look at what we do with paid sick leave in

17   this budget, as we reflect on what we've done

18   with paid family leave in this budget -- in

19   the prior years, I think we need to

20   creatively look at some certainty in

21   scheduling for our older workers at the same

22   time as we look at flexibility to allow them

23   to meet the other needs in their lives.    And

24   a recognition that some are in the workplace
                                                      223

 1   still because they want to continue to

 2   contribute and they want to do it in that

 3   way, versus maybe volunteerism; some are in

 4   the workplace -- and unfortunately, more and

 5   more -- because they can't make ends meet.

 6   And especially with that population, we owe

 7   it to them to find ways for them to continue

 8   to work in a flexible environment that allows

 9   them to do that.

10         So, you know, the discriminatory piece

11   of it, we can work on that.   The educational

12   piece of it we have to work on.   And what you

13   pointed out, what our older New Yorkers

14   contribute to our economy is enormous, and we

15   need to build on that.

16         So you don't really need to answer the

17   question -- it's not really a question -- I

18   just want to make sure -- and I know I have a

19   commitment from you, because we talked about

20   it before.   In this budget cycle there are a

21   number of policy decisions we're going to be

22   making that I think have an impact on our

23   older New Yorkers who are still in the

24   workplace or want to be in the workplace or
                                                       224

 1   are transferring in the workplace.    And so we

 2   owe it to them and we owe it to all

 3   New Yorkers to see what we can do in that

 4   regard.

 5         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Yeah, and I

 6   think that, you know, given your background,

 7   that is something that I'm absolutely

 8   interested in working on, because I couldn't

 9   agree with you more.

10         And, you know, the proportion of older

11   people in the workplace compared to the

12   younger population is only going to grow.

13   And so as you mentioned, there's a variety of

14   different reasons, there's a variety of

15   flexible things that have been tried.   And so

16   we would be absolutely honored to work with

17   you on that.

18         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:   My family, like

19   many families in New York, are -- we found

20   ourselves in the situation of the highest

21   number of people you serve, and that is my

22   mom, in her early eighties, a woman alone at

23   home who had 24/7 medical needs.   Not because

24   she couldn't function, but because she could
                                                         225

 1   have a medical episode that she couldn't

 2   respond to, and that could have been

 3   life-threatening.

 4           She wanted to age at home.   She wanted

 5   to stay at home to the end.    We worked

 6   with -- we have the luxury of a huge labor

 7   pool.   I have 11 brothers and sisters.     So we

 8   had that fortunate labor pool to be family

 9   caregivers.     We also self-paid and we also

10   relied on insurance and other mechanisms for

11   home care.

12           So I reiterate Senator May's, my

13   number-one priority when it comes to the

14   Aging Committee is the Caregiver Tax Credit.

15   We are capping it so we know the dollar

16   certainty.    We're limiting it so that it's

17   verifiable, eligible costs, so we know what

18   we're going to offset costs for for our

19   families.

20           But we also have to address the home

21   care workers.    And you had talked about

22   collaborating with other agencies in other

23   ways.   I would ask that you collaborate --

24   when we're looking at home care workers, we
                                                       226

 1   need to develop this workforce, recruit,

 2   retain and train workers.    But it has to be

 3   the medical healthcare, and it has to be the

 4   healthcare workers that help our aging.

 5         So what strategies would you use so

 6   that we move forward in a unified way to

 7   address all home care workers so that we're

 8   building that workforce?

 9         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, I mean

10   it's a huge issue.   Obviously it is for

11   Medicaid, and you heard about that yesterday.

12   And, you know, for our in-home program, it is

13   for us as well.   It's the fastest-growing-

14   need labor pool of every sector in the

15   country.   You know, people are living longer.

16   That's a great thing.    I mean, if you're born

17   today, you have a 50 percent chance of living

18   to a hundred.   I'm not sure if we're supposed

19   to, but we are.   Right?

20         So, you know, this -- there's a couple

21   of different things.    So the Governor, you

22   know, recognizes the workforce issue, not

23   only in this but in other areas.    And there

24   are internal workgroups having some of those
                                                     227

 1   conversations to see how we can address them.

 2         I think we had a couple of pretty

 3   innovative models that came out of the --

 4   some of the areas that had a shortage with

 5   the $15 million investment.   One is one of

 6   our counties -- and it was an old practice,

 7   years ago, that counties could hire their

 8   workers directly, and many of them got out of

 9   the business because the admin costs were

10   pretty expensive.   But one of our counties

11   got back into the business.   So you can

12   assure that, you know, the workers are there

13   to meet the need.

14         We had one county that had a

15   commitment and an arrangement with a local

16   home care agency to have seven aides,

17   full-time, assigned to the Office for the

18   Aging, which is really great.

19         What I really like about the model is

20   that the aides come to the office every

21   morning and are part of a care team.    Their

22   experience of what they see in the house with

23   the customer, maybe the family, some other

24   things, are part of a larger conversation.
                                                      228

 1   Many of them don't get that kind of support.

 2   They also were able to lease vehicles to make

 3   sure that they had rides to get to where they

 4   needed to be.

 5         I like to try to look at this issue a

 6   little bit more broadly.   So there's some

 7   things that we're working on currently with

 8   the Home Care Association and some of our own

 9   other partners to try to look at this

10   workforce issue out of the economic

11   development lens.

12         And so what I mean by that, there's

13   three areas that I think we could look at.

14   Is there a healthcare cost either to the

15   individual or to Medicaid or Medicare if an

16   individual either can't have their case

17   opened because there aren't the aides, or

18   they're getting less hours than they were

19   authorized because of an aide shortage.    And

20   what's the implication of that?   Emergency

21   room visits, hospitalizations or, most

22   importantly, the inability to discharge

23   safely back to the community and therefore --

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    If you could
                                                         229

 1   quickly finish.

 2           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Yeah, sorry

 3   about that.

 4           -- number one.   Number two is, you

 5   know, the wage impact on other benefits that

 6   individuals would receive by being paid a low

 7   wage, and is there an offset there.

 8           And then finally, if you're receiving

 9   additional dollars, is it an immediate impact

10   to the economy, to the tax base, local

11   businesses -- does it support the schools,

12   the tourism industry if you have more

13   discretionary money in your pocket?

14           So if we kind of pull these things

15   together, we might be able to have a

16   different conversation about the value.

17           ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Thank you very

18   much.   Appreciate it.

19           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

20   Senate?

21           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And we have a

22   second round for Aging chair Rachel May.        I

23   think our chairs are tag-teaming.

24           SENATOR MAY:   We are tag teaming each
                                                     230

 1   other, because I want to follow up on that

 2   and a question I asked earlier about money

 3   for economic development around the state.

 4         So we've got a zero-sum or a

 5   negative-sum budget that we're dealing with.

 6   And I definitely hear a lot about why we're

 7   putting money into regional economic

 8   development to develop new businesses or new

 9   opportunities for employment when we've got

10   already such needs for people to work in a

11   field like home healthcare.   And if the

12   government would consider shifting some of

13   that economic development money into areas

14   where you could employ somebody tomorrow, if

15   we had the money, if we were able to, you

16   know, boost that with a salary to something

17   where people would really want to do it.

18         So I'm wondering if that is -- if you

19   work together in any way with the REDC or

20   other economic development folks to just talk

21   about this.

22         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Well, I think

23   our role has been -- you know, given the

24   leadership of, you know, our agency, the
                                                       231

 1   Health Department, the Department of State in

 2   helping, you know, advance the age-friendly

 3   principles, et cetera, we've had a lot of

 4   opportunities to present to the REDCs across

 5   the state and really, again, talk about, you

 6   know, the economics of aging and the

 7   investment and trying to keep these resources

 8   in the community by supporting, you know, the

 9   types of things that need to be done to

10   improve people's health.

11         So I know that the way that the REDCs

12   work is, you know, within the regions you can

13   submit ideas to be funded.     And so certainly

14   that's an option that I hope that folks are

15   thinking about and proactively pursuing.

16         SENATOR MAY:    Okay.    Thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

18         So I believe that's all of the

19   questions we have for you for today -- oh,

20   I'm sorry.   Senator Serino.

21         SENATOR SERINO:   Thank you.     Good

22   afternoon, Commissioner Olsen.

23         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Hi, Senator,

24   how are you?
                                                        232

 1            SENATOR SERINO:   Good.   Nice to see

 2   you.

 3            And I just want to say Assemblyman

 4   Bronson asked quite a few of my questions,

 5   and I echo his sentiments.    And with the CSE,

 6   the $15 million is great, but I really do

 7   feel that we need more money.      I agree with

 8   the -- having a seat at the table for MRT,

 9   and I hope that we can all work together on

10   that.

11            Assemblymember Wright, the points on

12   elder abuse, I echo those as well.      The care

13   tax credit, that should be a number-one

14   priority.    It will drive down costs in other

15   areas.

16            The ombudsman, a lot of people, unless

17   you've had somebody in long-term care, you

18   probably don't even know who they are or what

19   they do, but they're the watchdog and the

20   patient advocate for these individuals, and

21   they're so critically important.

22            So my question, Commissioner, is do

23   you think that we have enough ombudsmen

24   operating in the state now?
                                                        233

 1         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     I think that

 2   we could definitely -- part of our strategy

 3   is to increase the number of highly trained

 4   volunteers to make sure that we have

 5   100 percent service coverage.

 6         SENATOR SERINO:     And then do you have

 7   ideas for incentivizing volunteers?    And do

 8   you think that you're going to need

 9   additional funding to do it?

10         ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     Yeah, so as I

11   mentioned earlier, we've been pilot-testing

12   the $75 a month stipend to some of the

13   volunteers that have really shown that

14   there's been a positive impact on recruitment

15   and retention and, more importantly, that

16   those higher-functioning volunteers are doing

17   a lot more work because of that stipend.      So

18   there's been a real positive cause and

19   effect, which we were hoping.    And that's

20   what we wanted to test.

21         So I think that's something that we're

22   looking at internally whether we can, you

23   know, not only continue but expand -- and

24   also want to do same thing with the HICAP
                                                       234

 1   program for exactly the same reasons.     A

 2   very, very labor intensive-type program with

 3   a lot of specialty.   And, you know, you need

 4   a special person to do that type of work.

 5   And so it's amazing that we have almost 900

 6   volunteers in those two programs that, again,

 7   are state-certified, go through an amazing

 8   training.   But it's intense, as you know,

 9   and -- so I'm proud that we can -- that we

10   can suggest that, yeah.

11         SENATOR SERINO:     And then my other

12   thought is with retirees.    You know, so often

13   people live longer, they're retiring and

14   they're looking for things to do to give back

15   to the communities.   Maybe if we did like a

16   tax credit for them, that would incentivize

17   them to do this as well, like we do with the

18   volunteer first responders.

19         My other question is, because it's one

20   of the biggest issues that I hear about, is

21   the affordable housing in our area.   And I

22   see in the proposal there's a reappropriation

23   of over $100 million for rental affordable

24   housing for low-income seniors.    What
                                                       235

 1   coordination of efforts do you have underway

 2   with HCR to ensure that housing needs for

 3   seniors are going to be met?

 4            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:   Yeah, I think

 5   the -- you know, the Governor's housing plan

 6   specifically tied funding to units.    So I

 7   know that there was 8,659 units of housing so

 8   far that have either been built or

 9   refurbished specifically for older adults,

10   and more as part of that plan.

11            I think again, you know, part of the

12   effort that we're undertaking to have a

13   top-down approach on age-friendly in the

14   eight domains, of which housing is one of

15   them, in a bottom-up approach is so that --

16   you know, we've got 27 municipalities now

17   that are officially certified and AARP/World

18   Health Organization age-friendly

19   communities -- are a grant that we just

20   completed that we're going to contract with

21   now, will bring another 13 communities on

22   board.

23            And why that's important is because

24   this is a real local effort, which again,
                                                         236

 1   housing and transportation and social

 2   inclusion, all those domains that you're very

 3   well aware of, these will be part of and have

 4   to be addressed as the municipalities go

 5   through this local planning process.       And so

 6   a lot of these decisions in terms of, you

 7   know, what's needed, how many housing units

 8   do you have, what are the ability to do X, Y,

 9   Z, will come as part of that planning

10   process.

11         And so I think you can see from like

12   where I come from that the opportunity here

13   to kind of push this -- the idea that these

14   are the types of things we all need to be

15   thinking of -- you know, workforce -- aging

16   is not just out here.   I mean, there's every

17   system that, in state government and

18   community, has to deal with older adults,

19   period.    And so, you know, part of the

20   planning and implementation process to become

21   age-friendly, that these housing options are

22   going to have to be discussed and planned for

23   and built at the local level.

24         SENATOR SERINO:    And that's one way of
                                                       237

 1   keeping our seniors here.     Because we keep

 2   talking about the outmigration of people

 3   here, and we talk a lot about the young

 4   population, but we're really not doing

 5   anything to keep the older population here.

 6           So -- and that was my question, too.

 7   Do you have any other ideas for keeping the

 8   seniors here?    Like how do we keep them

 9   here -- and I guess we'll have to continue

10   this conversation, because I see my clock is

11   running out.    But I think it's just something

12   to keep in the back of our minds that we do,

13   because once our older generation goes, the

14   younger tend to follow too, so.

15           ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:    Yeah.   And,

16   you know, just quickly, because I would love

17   to talk to you more about this -- I mean,

18   that has been our strategy.     We're aware of

19   that.

20           We're also aware that the reason

21   people don't always move is not just because

22   of taxes and the high cost of living.     There

23   are plenty of reports and studies about the

24   entire nation, using 85 different indicators
                                                         238

 1   on what matters to you in your community.

 2   And what's very interesting is that if you

 3   survey older adults in terms of what they

 4   want, how do they want their community

 5   designed, it's exactly the same types of

 6   things that millennials want.   They want to

 7   not have to rely on the automobile.    They

 8   want to go someplace where they can sit with

 9   a friend.    They want to socialize.   They want

10   to have access to trails and parks.

11            So all these things that I keep seeing

12   in the Governor's budget proposals over the

13   years, with the Empire Trail and parks and

14   things, all fit into this -- you know, that's

15   what's going to help us attract people to

16   come here, because this really is a great

17   state.    I'm a lifelong New Yorker.   But

18   you're not going to get these types of

19   environments elsewhere.    And recognizing that

20   we're competing with other states.

21            So, you know, as we talk to counties

22   and municipalities about why to engage into

23   these types of things -- because we are

24   competing with others who really get it.      And
                                                           239

 1   I think we are starting to get it here.         And

 2   that's why the Governor's leadership has

 3   really put this on steroids through Executive

 4   Order 190.

 5            SENATOR SERINO:   Great.    I look

 6   forward to talking to you about that.

 7            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.    So

 8   that completes the questions from the

 9   members.     Thank you for being here.

10            Next we will hear from Colonel Jim

11   McDonough, director of the New York State

12   Division of Veterans Services.

13            ACTING DIRECTOR OLSEN:     I am going to

14   just say, before I get out of here, I just

15   appreciate all of your support, both in the

16   Senate and the Assembly.     It's been long term

17   for our agency and your local offices for the

18   aging.     It's meaningful, and it matters.      So

19   thank you.

20            (Off the record.)

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Welcome here

22   for the first time.

23            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yes, thank

24   you very much for the invitation.      So I
                                                     240

 1   wanted to say that right up front.

 2         So good afternoon, Chairs Krueger and

 3   Weinstein, and distinguished members of the

 4   Senate and Assembly.

 5         My name is Colonel (Retired, U.S.

 6   Army) Jim McDonough, and I am the director of

 7   the New York State Division of Veterans'

 8   Services, or NYSDVS.   Thank you for the

 9   opportunity to discuss Governor Cuomo's

10   2020-2021 Executive Budget as it relates to

11   the New York State Division of Veterans'

12   Services.   The core mission of the Division

13   of Veterans' Services is to connect veterans,

14   members of the armed forces and their

15   families and dependents to various economic,

16   medical and societal benefits, programs and

17   services available to them due to their

18   active-duty military service.

19         As an agency entering its 75th year of

20   service to New York State, DVS's professional

21   benefits advising staff prepares, presents,

22   and processes applications for United States

23   Department of Veterans Affairs -- VA --

24   compensation and pension awards, education
                                                      241

 1   benefits, burial benefits, vocational

 2   rehabilitation training, health care, nursing

 3   home care, real property tax exemptions, and

 4   other resources, services, and care on behalf

 5   of individual veterans and their families.

 6         Under Governor Cuomo's leadership,

 7   New York remains a state where veterans and

 8   their families are proud to call home.     And

 9   with the additional support of the State

10   Legislature, we can continue to provide the

11   best possible care and assistance for those

12   who have served our country.

13         The agency's economic impact,

14   delivered directly to New York's veteran

15   families, yields incredible results annually,

16   with over $750 million in tax-free federal

17   dollars for thousands of New York's veterans

18   filtering into every community across

19   New York State, this alone due to our

20   agency's actions.   These efforts have a real

21   and measurable impact on improving the

22   quality of life and access to care for

23   veterans and their families.

24         This year, under Governor Cuomo's
                                                      242

 1   leadership, the division strengthened its

 2   relationship with our partners in county

 3   veterans' service agencies through

 4   improvements being made in training,

 5   technology, and tools by which to best serve

 6   our mutual clients.   Importantly, the

 7   division is overhauling its training programs

 8   to be more inclusive of our partners in

 9   county veterans' service agencies by offering

10   them access to all training and education

11   endeavors.   Our strategy is simple:   what we

12   provide for our own team, we will ultimately

13   provide to the counties, and at no additional

14   expense to them.

15         It is with this same commitment to

16   bettering the lives of New York's veterans

17   and their families that this year's

18   Executive Budget includes initiatives which

19   will additionally address their mental

20   health, housing and educational needs.    The

21   Governor's budget also seeks to establish

22   further dignified burial options for

23   New York's veteran families by establishing

24   the state's first veterans' cemetery.
                                                     243

 1         The proposed budget also supports

 2   investments of $5 million to expand permanent

 3   supportive housing for homeless veterans

 4   through the state's Homeless Housing and

 5   Assistance Program, HHAP, and $1 million to

 6   partner with organizations to help veterans,

 7   law enforcement, and first responders with

 8   suicide prevention efforts.

 9         We are grateful for the continued

10   support of Governor Cuomo and his

11   administration in further investing in the

12   needs of our veteran families.   We are

13   committed to working with our partners at

14   New York State Homes and Community Renewal

15   and the New York State Office of Temporary

16   and Disability Assistance to support housing

17   New York's veterans and to apply these

18   additional resources best.    We will also

19   utilize other funds such as the Homeless

20   Veterans Assistance Fund to address

21   additional societal needs of New York's

22   veteran families.

23         As the state agency of record charged

24   with assisting them, we maintain a very
                                                        244

 1   robust and outwardly facing stance, with

 2   easy-to-access offices in every major VA

 3   Medical Center in New York State, coupled

 4   with an increasing presence in VA Vet Centers

 5   and community-based outpatient clinics, as

 6   well as community settings.

 7         Combined, our agency's efforts will

 8   continue to provide the best quality service

 9   to New York's veterans, service members and

10   their families for the next 75 years and

11   beyond.

12         Thank you for the opportunity to

13   present the Governor's Executive Budget to

14   the committee.   And on behalf of New York's

15   veteran families, thank you for your

16   continued support of the agency's mission.     I

17   look forward to answering any questions you

18   may have.   Thank you.

19         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

20   being here.

21         And we'll go to our Assembly chair of

22   the Veterans' Committee, Didi Barrett.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:   Thank you.

24   Thank you for being here --
                                                            245

 1            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes, ma'am.

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    -- and thank

 3   you, Madams Chair.

 4            I appreciate the commitment in the

 5   budget and your focus on -- well, let me say

 6   at the offset we're really happy to have you

 7   here, and we're happy to have a head of the

 8   division.    It makes a difference in this

 9   budget process, but it obviously has been

10   making a difference all along, since you

11   were -- came into this position last spring,

12   was that --

13            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    April.     April

14   of last year.    My second time, as you know.

15            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Yes, your

16   second round.    But the first as the director,

17   right?

18            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I was the

19   same position.

20            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Oh, the same

21   position?

22            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I'm on my

23   second spin, yes.

24            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    And the second
                                                        246

 1   time's a charm?

 2         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    It is,

 3   absolutely.

 4         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Good.

 5         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    It's an

 6   honor, actually, so.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    I appreciate

 8   the commitment and the work on housing.     But

 9   as you know, many times especially veterans,

10   but others, are homeless because of other

11   issues.   And so I'm very concerned -- and I

12   know this is not in our budget, but what are

13   you doing to ensure that the Governor puts in

14   Dwyer funding, which has been one of the most

15   effective programs in the peer-to-peer --

16   with the peer-to-peer model.    It's not in

17   every county yet.   It should be in every

18   county.   It should be fully funded.    And it

19   should be funded from the Executive, not just

20   from the Legislature.

21         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Sure.    Let me

22   address the Dwyer program.   Although my

23   colleagues in the Office of Mental Health run

24   the program, we are more or less integrated
                                                        247

 1   behind the scenes on the delivery of those

 2   resources to the 26 of 62 counties to which

 3   they now flow.

 4          It's a good program.   I think it needs

 5   to be looked at in terms of a bit of

 6   standardization and quality in terms of what

 7   are the deliverables behind the program.       I

 8   think we need to look at things like impact,

 9   measurable outcomes desired to the program.

10          And I think the program could use a

11   bit of a refresh around what we put in for

12   all.   There are very good programs in those

13   26 counties.   They differ as much as the

14   counties differ.

15          ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    So would it

16   help if it were under your division as

17   opposed to the OMH?

18          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    You know,

19   I -- it matters not to me where it's

20   ultimately placed, but what impact can I have

21   on the program from whether I sit at the

22   center of it or adjacent to it.   I'm actively

23   involved with my partners in OMH in shaping

24   the future of that.
                                                       248

 1           I can tell that you that as I approve

 2   the monies to be sent forward, because it

 3   does come through the division out of OMH, I

 4   look hard at what are the activities, the

 5   scope of work, and what's the impact that

 6   we're seeking through those grants.

 7           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Okay.   Thank

 8   you.    I mean, it is one -- the one issue that

 9   I hear from all my colleagues over and over,

10   is they know when it's working in their --

11           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I hear the

12   same.   And they are hungry for a bit of

13   reinforcement around quality and expectations

14   and training that goes into the program.

15           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    And

16   consistency.   I mean --

17           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yup.

18           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    -- I think,

19   you know, and there are counties that have,

20   you know, no access to it, so that makes a

21   difference.

22           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Absolutely.

23           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    I was very

24   happy last year to sponsor the legislation
                                                     249

 1   which became law that allows veterans with

 2   bad papers, as you know, to apply for New

 3   York State veterans benefits that they

 4   otherwise would not have been eligible for.

 5           What, if any, are the resources that

 6   you've put into this year's budget to

 7   implement that measure?

 8           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Sure.   And

 9   thank you for the leadership on the

10   Restoration of Honor Act, both you and

11   Senator Brooks, and we really appreciate

12   that.

13           So the Restoration of Honor Act,

14   signed into law by the Governor on Veterans

15   Day of last year, is a very new programmatic

16   effort within the Division of Veterans'

17   Services.   And just as you indicate, this is

18   really a first-of-its-kind in the nation

19   opportunity for those individual service

20   members who have been uncharacteristically

21   discharged from their military service due to

22   five conditions or issues -- posttraumatic

23   stress disorder, traumatic brain injury,

24   military sexual trauma, and sexual
                                                       250

 1   orientation or gender identity.

 2            And so if a service member has been

 3   uncharacteristically discharged with paper

 4   other than honorable, we are the first state

 5   in the nation that's going to say to those

 6   individuals, there's a process for you by

 7   which to apply for and receive state veterans

 8   benefits.    And while we're not influencing

 9   the federal benefits delivery system yet,

10   we're recognizing that as a progressive state

11   in this country, we have an additional

12   responsibility for New York's veteran

13   families to turn on those benefits as we can.

14            We have baked into the backroom of the

15   Division of Veterans' Services a complete

16   business process for handling those

17   applications.    The infrastructure is in

18   place.    We have an education campaign about

19   to get underway with other state agencies and

20   state leaders.    Because as you know, the

21   division doesn't control every state veterans

22   benefit -- Parks and Rec, fishing licenses

23   those things, DMV.   We've got a big education

24   campaign ahead of us to get the state
                                                        251

 1   agencies on board with recognizing that as we

 2   approve these benefits, their responsibility

 3   is to turn them on.

 4           I've spent a lot of time on this,

 5   Didi.   The last three to four months of my

 6   time have been focused inwardly on getting

 7   the Restoration of Honor Act's elements in

 8   place so that we can begin processing those

 9   applications right away.   And we're about

10   30 days away from putting that in place.

11           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    So you think

12   there will be specific funding in the 30-day

13   amendments, or is that the --

14           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    No.   I think

15   what I'm referring to is that we have the

16   business processes in place, the eligibility

17   determinations, the infrastructure to process

18   those applications.

19           My understanding of the fiscal impact

20   of the turning on of state veterans benefits

21   is negligible, given where we are with cash

22   ceilings and appropriations in these various

23   programs.

24           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    So with your
                                                         252

 1   current staff and with the current network --

 2            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes.

 3            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    --- you feel

 4   it's just a matter of --

 5            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I do.

 6            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    -- of

 7   prioritizing and getting this information

 8   out --

 9            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I do.

10            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    -- at no cost?

11            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    We oversee a

12   lot of programs, this being one, and we're

13   fully capable of addressing this within the

14   division.

15            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    What about for

16   the appellate unit to upgrade?      Is there

17   funding implications of that?

18            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yeah, I --

19   within the division's overall budget I've

20   carved out funding for our brand new

21   appellate unit, as you referred to it.      It's,

22   again, the first time the division has had

23   such infrastructure.   I'm actually

24   reinforcing it in the next 90 days.
                                                        253

 1           At this point it's more about shifting

 2   assets to their first best use and looking at

 3   efficiency before I pop up and say I need

 4   more.   I am making more right now with what I

 5   have, as my first course of action, because I

 6   actually believe that's what I'm paid to do.

 7   And then I think the appropriate response,

 8   given additional requirements, will be --

 9   will be met, so.

10           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Okay, thank

11   you.    And then on the issue of the

12   Article VII language, I mean, as you know

13   we've got a couple of colleagues who are

14   interested in having state military

15   cemeteries in their districts.     The committee

16   that I guess you're chairing for site

17   selection and the development process -- is

18   there such a committee?

19           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Is there a

21   process in place?    Can you tell us about

22   that.

23           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Sure.

24           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Because I
                                                        254

 1   think there's a lot of concern to have -- you

 2   know, in what you've been asking for, that,

 3   you know, we might be abdicating some of our

 4   responsibility for some of that.

 5            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Yeah.   No, I

 6   will not let that happen.    As you know, my

 7   relationship with you and others is one where

 8   we are partners in this endeavor, so.

 9            The current statute, the amendment

10   being introduced is being introduced to get

11   us up and running relative to the times.      I

12   think if you look at 15 years ago when the

13   statute was first drafted, it called for a

14   study.    We have to put a study together, even

15   in the revised language being introduced into

16   the study, for siting and management and

17   oversight of the cemetery.    So for me it's a

18   process whereby I will engage with you

19   throughout.    Just because I'm putting the

20   committee structure together doesn't mean

21   that I'm going to not live up to my

22   responsibilities to be your partner in

23   government, to involve you in every step of

24   the way.
                                                       255

 1         So the committee is being formed.

 2   There will be an announcement forthcoming

 3   about its membership.   Key to the committee's

 4   responsibilities will be to engage with the

 5   Legislature on all fronts to make sure that

 6   that is not the case.   And you have my

 7   personal commitment to making sure that is

 8   not such.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:     And you will

10   be open to hearing the -- you know, the other

11   possible locations --

12         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Absolutely.

13         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:     -- as well as,

14   obviously, the questions about long-term

15   funding.    And, you know, the fact that we

16   can't fund a lot of programs that we want to

17   fund, but we're putting money into this.

18         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Every step of

19   the way.    I mean, what we have to do as a

20   committee is we have to come together on the

21   siting, first and foremost.   And then we have

22   to put together the management, the

23   resources, the infrastructure required to

24   support state veterans cemetery operations.
                                                        256

 1         I've been working with the Division of

 2   Budget and my partners in the executive

 3   branch with cost models relative to the other

 4   48 states that operate state veterans

 5   cemeteries.   We're dialed into the National

 6   Cemetery Administration and its requirements.

 7   And I'm pleased that we're where we are in

 8   terms of the planning to kind of establish

 9   the state's first veterans cemetery.

10         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:     Okay,

11   thank you.

12         And just as a final point, I've been

13   hearing from people -- and we did at the last

14   hearing we did on the nursing homes that are

15   our state nursing homes --

16         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     The state

17   veterans homes?

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:     Yeah, the

19   veterans homes, sorry.    Can you talk a little

20   bit about how -- the funding and, you know,

21   the viability of those?

22         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yeah.   Again,

23   I don't run them or own them, but my partners

24   in the Department of Health and SUNY actually
                                                        257

 1   oversee our five state veterans homes -- four

 2   in the Health Department, one in SUNY down at

 3   Stony Brook.

 4          I think I've been in all of them.     And

 5   while they're wonderful facilities, every

 6   program we're part of has room for

 7   improvement.   The most challenging of the

 8   homes is Oxford in terms of its staffing

 9   models, and I think we need to look at that

10   carefully as to what incentives could be put

11   in place to kind of incentivize clinicians,

12   providers to kind of work in that rural neck

13   of the woods in our state.

14          If you go to Long Island, it's -- the

15   census is always there, St. Albans, Montrose.

16   I've been in a lot of nursing homes lately

17   and a lot of senior facilities.   And the

18   state veterans homes, while they have their

19   share of challenges with staffing, are some

20   of the best-run facilities that I've been in

21   in the past three years of my life, my mom

22   having passed away in one of them, so.

23          ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:   Okay.   Thank

24   you.

 1            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 2            Senate?

 3            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 4   Senator John Brooks, our chair of the

 5   Veterans Committee.

 6            SENATOR BROOKS:   Thank you, Madam

 7   Chairman.     {Mic off; inaudible.}.

 8            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     I think your

 9   mic, sir --

10            (Off the record.)

11            SENATOR BROOKS:   Okay, good.   Sorry.

12   Once again, Colonel, it's good to see you.

13            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    You too, sir.

14            SENATOR BROOKS:   Thank you for your

15   service, by the way.

16            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    It was an

17   honor.

18            SENATOR BROOKS:   You know, I think our

19   veterans in this state are probably one of

20   the key assets we have -- men and women who

21   have served this country with -- many with

22   distinction, served in different sets of

23   circumstances.     And unfortunately, many of

24   them are facing issues, and as you and I well
                                                          259

 1   know.

 2           We have a suicide problem.   We had a

 3   group in the other day, the female side of

 4   that problem seems to be getting worse.

 5   We've got many people, homeless people

 6   looking for food, people with mental health

 7   issues.     A lot -- a lot of problems there.

 8           You know, I think we've done some good

 9   things.     This particular budget, I'm very --

10   very disappointed in one -- one particular

11   situation.    You know, the budget -- and you

12   and I have talked about the cemetery a number

13   of times.    It's in the budget, and that's

14   good.   But the legislative incentives -- or

15   initiatives, rather, that we put in the

16   budget last year, all of them were cut out.

17           That's programs for the living.

18   That's programs that respect the service that

19   these men and women gave to this country.       It

20   addresses the needs and problems that they're

21   dealing with today.    We know, for example,

22   with many of the Vietnam vets, the Agent

23   Orange problems are only becoming worse.       Yet

24   it's all cut from the budget.    And these men
                                                      260

 1   and women who serve this country, some in

 2   battle, are now, over the next couple of

 3   weeks, going to come back here and beg us to

 4   put that money back in the budget.

 5           They are owed more respect from us as

 6   a state than to do that.   Those programs

 7   work.   Those programs should be expanded.

 8   The Dwyer program right now in Washington is

 9   being considered to be taken national.      We

10   shouldn't be in a situation of in a way

11   disrespecting our veterans by telling them:

12   You've got to come ask for that again.

13           We should be in a situation today

14   where you're in a position to announce that

15   because of the various programs, we've housed

16   5,000 more veterans, or the suicide rate has

17   dropped by 30 percent.   So I find the history

18   of the way we've handled this budget in some

19   ways very disappointing.   And I don't direct

20   that at you at all.   And I compliment you for

21   the approach you've been taking, the

22   discussions that we've had.   But I think we

23   have to do better.

24           And I think we have to recognize that
                                                       261

 1   these folks have some serious challenges.

 2   And it's unfortunate, you can go in many of

 3   the communities in this state and see

 4   somebody with a sign that says "Veteran,

 5   homeless."   We can do better than that.

 6           So I appreciate what you're trying to

 7   do.   I appreciate the initiatives you're

 8   taking.   I think the cemetery program is a

 9   good program.   But we have to be honest with

10   ourselves.   We have to be honest with

11   ourselves that many veterans are facing

12   significant, significant challenges.     And we

13   should be proactive and recognize those

14   programs, put the money in the budget at the

15   front end, recognize what we're going to do,

16   be in a position to report the information

17   back.

18           You know, we've talked a lot about

19   communication with the veterans and programs

20   to make them aware of, and assistance.     And

21   it's all good stuff.   And I want to work with

22   you to make sure we accomplish that.     But

23   when I saw the budget once again and we saw,

24   what, $106 million cut from the budget from
                                                        262

 1   programs we worked hard to put in place,

 2   programs that do work, programs that veterans

 3   groups are counting on -- and now we're going

 4   to go through the process of trying to fund

 5   them again.   And last year we know we missed

 6   some of them, and those funds weren't there.

 7         So, you know, you're showing great

 8   leadership in this, and we've had many a good

 9   conversation.   But this budget isn't the way

10   it should have been done.   This budget

11   shouldn't say to veterans, come ask us again

12   for what not only you deserve, but we should

13   be proud to give them and talk about how

14   we're enhancing some programs.

15         So I don't really have a question.       I

16   mean, we've talked about pretty much

17   everything under the sun --

18         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:      Yeah, may I

19   address a couple of your points?

20         SENATOR BROOKS:   But -- but I just --

21   I think we could do this better.    And our

22   veterans deserve better.

23         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:      So you're

24   never going to hear me say I can't do
                                                       263

 1   something better, because I know that's part

 2   of life every day.   So that's point number

 3   one.

 4          The second point I'd like to make is

 5   that when we talk about our veteran

 6   population, the tendency is to think of these

 7   individual baskets of problems.    The truth is

 8   there's a lot of co-occurrence that

 9   transcends veterans' issues.   Housing is

10   related to legal, is related to family, is

11   related to financing.

12          So the best thinking in the world will

13   tell you that at this point in life -- and

14   I've been part of it for the last 15 years

15   since retiring -- is that there's a lot of

16   capacity out there that just remains, you

17   know, unnavigable.   And the greatest effort

18   has got to be put forth in breaking down the

19   silos where there is rich capacity to address

20   human needs.   That's point one.

21          Point two is that for every veteran

22   who has a problem, there's five to eight

23   veterans who are functioning highly as

24   wonderful assets in our communities, setting
                                                      264

 1   examples for others to kind of live their

 2   lives by.    So I know we tend to think of

 3   those with problems.   Just flipping that

 4   narrative slightly to recognize that these

 5   problems are real, they're overlapping, they

 6   co-occur -- but all around these troubled

 7   souls are in fact people trying to help them,

 8   and they're very good veterans of our armed

 9   force.

10            With respect to the budget, I want to

11   make this very clear, that the Governor's

12   commitment, based upon inputs from those of

13   us on the Executive side of the coin, reflect

14   what we believe are some of the greatest

15   priorities, you know, that need to be

16   addressed for our veteran population.

17   Housing, a $5 million additional investment

18   in tackling the homeless problem.    That's a

19   large investment given where the fiscal

20   realities of the State of New York are right

21   now.   A new million-dollar initiative to

22   address suicidality amongst law enforcement,

23   first responders and our veterans.

24            So the things you talk about, we're
                                                        265

 1   listening.   We're doing more with these new

 2   initiatives in the next 12 months than have

 3   been done in the last three years.     And while

 4   I recognize my responsibility is to work with

 5   you to kind of right whatever wrong I can --

 6   you have my commitment to doing so.     Both you

 7   and Assemblywoman Barrett know how closely I

 8   want to work with you.

 9         So I'm one of them, is the last thing

10   I'll say.    I am a veteran myself.   This is

11   personal and professional.   And I go to work

12   every day trying to meet the expectations of

13   those I am charged with serving.      Some days

14   we do it better than others, but every day we

15   put forth a good-faith effort across the

16   agency, with our partners in county

17   government and in the federal government, to

18   make a dent in the problem, so -- and you

19   have my ongoing commitment to do so.

20         SENATOR BROOKS:    Yeah.   No, I -- and I

21   do think we have opportunities.

22         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yeah, we do.

23         SENATOR BROOKS:    Certainly as we look

24   over the program in Stony Brook, the nursing
                                                      266

 1   home and the day care center, we should try

 2   to expand that where we can.

 3          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Absolutely.

 4          SENATOR BROOKS:   I think there's a lot

 5   of opportunities.   I just -- I just am

 6   upset --

 7          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     I get it,

 8   sir.

 9          SENATOR BROOKS:   -- like I said, that

10   people are going to have to come to ask for

11   things that we know work.    We should have

12   shown the respect of putting them in the

13   budget.

14          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    I think in

15   this budget we are doing some new things that

16   weren't there a year ago, and we will

17   continue to press for innovative program

18   delivery and capacity to address the needs of

19   the people I served with, so.

20          SENATOR BROOKS:   Thank you.

21          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Assemblyman

23   Walczyk.

24          ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:    Director
                                                        267

 1   McDonough, sir, first, thank you for your

 2   20 years -- 26 years of service.    And we're

 3   certainly very fortunate to have you continue

 4   to serve in this capacity, so --

 5         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Thank you.

 6         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     -- thanks for

 7   being here.

 8         I have the distinct honor of

 9   representing what I call the front yard of

10   America.    It's northern Jefferson and

11   St. Lawrence Counties.   I have a 120-mile

12   border with Canada, and Fort Drum is in my

13   backyard.    So we have the fastest-growing

14   veteran population in New York State.     And as

15   such, veterans services is near and dear to

16   my heart and important to the representation

17   that I do in this job.

18         You as a young officer I'm sure were

19   told to salute and execute at times --

20         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:      {Chuckling.}.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     -- and there's

22   no real -- in the same way that we do our

23   business here in the Legislature, there's no

24   opportunity, many cases in the Army, for
                                                      268

 1   compromise or negotiation.   People die if

 2   you're taking that time, right?   So you

 3   salute and execute.

 4         And something else -- and I also

 5   served, but you've talked a few times today

 6   already about doing more with less.   And I

 7   can think of these training opportunities in

 8   the past where, all right, well, we didn't

 9   get all the equipment we want, but we'll

10   figure it out, because that's impressed on

11   you as a leader.

12         But I think when it comes to taking

13   care of our veterans, doing more with less is

14   not an acceptable thing.   When you talk about

15   the great work that the Private Joseph P.

16   Dwyer Program is doing, if you look at the

17   Veterans Outreach Center in Watertown,

18   New York, I mean, I've seen it firsthand how

19   important this funding is.   When you talk

20   about Helmets to Hard hats and, you know, the

21   work that they're doing with our local IBEW

22   to transition soldiers out of the military

23   and hand them right into the workforce -- and

24   we're talking about retaining some of the
                                                         269

 1   best leaders and young minds and great

 2   workforce in New York State.    I mean, that's

 3   an investment I can't compromise on.

 4         When you look at the great work that

 5   Clear Path for Veterans is doing in Central

 6   New York, the phenomenal things that they're

 7   doing -- service animals to yoga, you know,

 8   you can enter a yoga program there, Project

 9   Healing Waters.     Even SAGE, I was surprised

10   to see the Governor -- which is, you know,

11   addressed as a group that he usually says

12   he's very friendly to and can't be ignored,

13   certainly in our veteran community.

14         You were an OCS graduate, right?

15         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Correct.

16         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     Me as well.    And

17   I don't know if you remember the call and

18   response in OCS, but at Officer Candidate

19   School, when you salute, one individual says

20   "Standards."   And do you remember what the

21   response is, sir?

22         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     "All the way"

23   is what we said.

24         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     Well, that's
                                                        270

 1   Airborne:   "Airborne all the way."

 2           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Yeah, I was

 3   an Airborne soldier.

 4           ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:   Yup.   And

 5   Airborne's right behind the OCS School.     But

 6   the response is "No compromise."      And that's

 7   where I'm at on this --

 8           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Understood.

 9           ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:   -- when it comes

10   to zeroing out these important programs in

11   this budget that the Governor's set forward.

12   I don't think there's room for compromise

13   here.   I think they have to be restored.    And

14   I'd appreciate any comment that --

15           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Yeah, sure.

16   So let me take a swing at this.

17           So, first of all, I actually didn't

18   say "do more with less," so let's be clear on

19   what I did say.    What I did say is my first

20   course of business is to make sure that I'm

21   making the best use of the resources I have.

22   And I have found inefficiency.    I have found

23   malpositioned veterans' benefits advisors

24   that I've moved.   I have found the ability to
                                                     271

 1   kind of squeeze where resources weren't being

 2   put to their first best use, and I have

 3   shifted those responsibilities.

 4         So this is not a game of doing more

 5   with less.   This is, first of all, a set of

 6   responsibilities that recognizes my

 7   responsibility is to run a good organization

 8   to the best of my ability, first, and then if

 9   that's not possible, to seek the additional

10   resources to do so.

11         But I'll be honest with you, I found a

12   lot of inefficiency.   I found malpositioned

13   resources.   I've found people where the

14   demand wasn't there.   I've shifted them to

15   where the marketplace demands more resources.

16         I was the state director who placed

17   veterans' benefits advisors on Fort Drum,

18   New York, to cooperate with the DOD, where I

19   used to be assigned, to assist in the

20   transition of people like me off that

21   installation.   The last seven years of my

22   life I built the Onward to Opportunity

23   program, the Career Skills program -- of

24   which Helmets to Hard Hats is one -- which
                                                      272

 1   does a great deal of work to ensure that

 2   today transitioning service members leave

 3   service with a job before they separate from

 4   service.    So I couldn't agree with you more.

 5         But let's recognize I've been in the

 6   chair for nine months.   My first

 7   responsibility is to make the first best use

 8   of my resources.   When that's all said and

 9   done, I'm not afraid to seek the additional

10   resources required to run this place best.

11   And I think the Executive Budget reflects my

12   voice that housing and suicide prevention is

13   a big issue in this state, as it is in this

14   country, and I'm going to do my best to kind

15   of address those issues.

16         So I'm not -- for those that know me,

17   I don't compromise.    I am relentless in my

18   pursuit of right and what's good for people

19   who serve their country, and I will continue

20   to be so.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN WALCZYK:     Thank you, sir.

22         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yup.

23         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

24         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator Savino.
                                                         273

 1         SENATOR SAVINO:    Thank you, Senator

 2   Krueger.

 3         Commissioner,     I just have one -- two

 4   questions, actually.    One, on the veterans

 5   cemetery, I know there's going to be a lot of

 6   competition for where it should go.   But

 7   there's long been an effort to bring one to

 8   Staten Island because of the difficulty and

 9   the distance that Staten Island residents

10   have to go currently.    So I'd just hope that

11   that would be part of the discussion.

12         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     It is, yeah.

13   So -- can I comment on that very quickly?

14         SENATOR SAVINO:    Sure, absolutely.

15         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     So the

16   National Cemetery Administration is putting

17   forth an effort to build a columbarium on the

18   grounds of St. Albans.   And so I think you'll

19   see that come about.    It's in the National

20   Cemetery Administration's priorities.      As you

21   know, land is a premium.   So this is an

22   inside columbarium, kind of a first-of-its-

23   kind set of plans.   So I think when we get to

24   down to Queens and areas like that, you'll
                                                      274

 1   see some improvements right there.

 2         SENATOR SAVINO:     Hopefully so.

 3         And then finally, three years ago on

 4   Veterans Day the Governor signed an amendment

 5   to the Compassionate Care Act, which is our

 6   medical marijuana statute in New York State,

 7   and he did it largely to add PTSD as a

 8   qualifying condition.     That decision was

 9   driven largely by the efforts of the New York

10   State Veterans Council and others recognizing

11   the vast numbers of veterans who are

12   suffering from PTSD.

13         So since that time do you have any

14   sense of how many veterans have been able to

15   avail themselves of it?    And has their been

16   any coordination with the VA?

17         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yeah.   Yup.

18         SENATOR SAVINO:     Because there was

19   always a concern that they would use that

20   against them.

21         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yeah, it's

22   still a tricky issue because of the

23   difference of opinion between the federal

24   government and -- and certainly the state.
                                                      275

 1         We are part of the newly stood-up

 2   Governor's Cannabis Task Force, where we will

 3   kind of address the concerns of our

 4   population within the development of a

 5   cannabis program for the State of New York.

 6   But it is of concern in our population

 7   because of access to VA benefits.   There's a

 8   lot of hypotheticals out there on what could

 9   happen.

10         It's a tricky place to navigate with

11   an individual veteran because of pain

12   management and the things that the federal

13   government does not allow.   But we are having

14   input to the process in the Cannabis Task

15   Force that is stood up by the Governor.

16         SENATOR SAVINO:   That's my final point

17   on this.   So my brother-in-law passed away

18   two years ago, he was a veteran.    He got his

19   medical services from the VA.    He suffered

20   from spinal stenosis, which as you can

21   imagine is incredibly painful.    While New

22   York State said you could only get a 30-day

23   prescription at a time for Oxycontin for his

24   pain, the VA would mail him 90 days at a
                                                       276

 1   time.   Suffice to say he became incredibly

 2   dependent on the medication.      And when they

 3   added fentanyl patches to it, it was only a

 4   matter of time before he died.     That's what

 5   happened.

 6           So is there any coordination between

 7   the VA and the healthcare providers and even

 8   yourself in this state to say the amount of

 9   drugs they're giving people at one time is

10   contributing to an early death for a lot of

11   these veterans who are suffering from PTSD,

12   suffering from chronic pain?      Injuries that

13   they may have sustained decades ago are still

14   bedeviling them.   I mean, what can we do to

15   get a handle on this?

16           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    So first of

17   all, I'm sorry for your loss.     That's the

18   first thing I will say.

19           SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you.

20           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    The second

21   thing is I think you'd be surprised how

22   involved I am in formularies at individual

23   clinics across the state.    I have a friend of

24   mine who's a cardiac nurse in Plattsburgh,
                                                      277

 1   New York, and she couldn't get a drug out of

 2   formulary for a veteran, a Vietnam veteran

 3   that she was caring for.

 4         She called me and let me know the

 5   frustration he was having.    I went right to

 6   the VA Medical Center director and explained

 7   the situation; he went right into the lab and

 8   reestablished the proper medication, the

 9   cardiac medication.

10         So we are involved in small ways and

11   in big ways.    You know, I'm of a generation

12   where a lot of drugs were prescribed to my

13   friends who served with me -- overmedication,

14   as you'd say.    That's kind of going by the

15   wayside a little bit.   The trend line is less

16   so, because I think what we're realizing is

17   that sadly, that doesn't solve a person's

18   problems.   So I think you're seeing the trend

19   shift a little bit away from overmedication

20   to other forms of therapy and clinical

21   approaches.    But certainly my population

22   recognizes the danger of being prescribed too

23   much in terms of the pain and suffering that

24   comes from war, so.
                                                       278

 1         SENATOR SAVINO:     Thank you.   And

 2   finally, there are some local initiatives

 3   that are coming forward.   In Brooklyn a local

 4   veterans group is starting a mindful

 5   meditation program.   And I think those are

 6   the types of things the VA and the State

 7   Veterans could be very helpful in

 8   establishing and, you know, coordinating with

 9   veterans organizations.

10         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:      I mean, you

11   mentioned Clear Path for Veterans and yoga.

12   We fund Clear Path for Veterans.     We fund

13   SAGE Vets.    So we're investing in these I

14   would say innovative approaches to dealing

15   with pain management, trauma and the impact

16   of war.   And we're big believers in

17   whatever --

18         SENATOR SAVINO:     Whatever works.

19         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:      -- works for

20   one person.    I'm not a judge.   If someone

21   tells me that these things work, I'm

22   generally going to take a hard look at it,

23   can we can develop the evidence around it,

24   and go from there, so.
                                                     279

 1         SENATOR SAVINO:    Thank you.

 2         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    You're

 3   welcome.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 5         We go to Assemblywoman Barrett for a

 6   second five minutes.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Thank you

 8   again for being here.

 9         And I just wanted to clarify a couple

10   of points and then ask for one additional

11   subject we haven't covered.

12         We may in the enacted budget fund SAGE

13   and Clear Path and Helmets to Hard Hats and a

14   lot of other things, but it's never in the

15   Executive Budget.    And to my colleagues'

16   points here, you know, it would be -- it's

17   very hard to explain to constituents when you

18   get back, you know, to the district, or

19   veterans in general that, well, no, it's not

20   in the Executive Budget, but we're -- it's a

21   legislative add.    What does that mean to --

22   you know, to most people?   Nothing.

23         So I think that it's really

24   important -- and I know that you've only been
                                                        280

 1   here 10 months and it's -- you know, and

 2   you've done a tremendous amount, and I really

 3   appreciate particularly the outreach with the

 4   counties, because that has been a real

 5   bottleneck and a real source of waste --

 6         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:     -- and

 8   redundancy, so that's really important.     But,

 9   you know, I think that it's important that

10   this budget be a holistic statement of what

11   matters not just to the Legislature but to

12   the state.   And I would love you to kind of

13   look more seriously at that in the future.

14         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Absolutely.

15         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    And the other

16   issue that I -- and I'll let you answer both

17   of them -- is that we really didn't talk at

18   all about the special issues around women

19   veterans.    And I'm wondering if there's

20   anything in the budget here or in your

21   priority list that's addressing that.

22         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Sure, let me

23   talk about that for a moment.   And thank you

24   for the question.
                                                       281

 1         So before I came over here this

 2   morning, I introduced to my own organization

 3   our new deputy director for diversity, equity

 4   and inclusion.   Kind of an elevated title, if

 5   you will, beyond "women veterans

 6   coordinator," which by statute I'm supposed

 7   to have.

 8         My approach to this is to kind of

 9   integrate our efforts across all lines of

10   activities that I'm responsible for.    The

11   idea of marginalized subsets of the veteran

12   population is highly disturbing to me.     The

13   nature of becoming a veteran of the armed

14   forces in this country has been plagued by

15   membership and identity with one group versus

16   another.

17         And I -- I don't buy that.     You served

18   your country, you are in fact entitled to the

19   fair treatment that I can deliver regardless

20   of the circumstance.    That even extends to

21   those with bad paper.    The subsets or the

22   subdemographics don't concern me.   What

23   concerns me is elevating them up into this

24   pattern of services, resources and care that
                                                      282

 1   can be delivered to anyone in the least

 2   amount of time with the greatest amount of

 3   efficacy.

 4         And so my approach, why I introduced

 5   this person this morning to my own team, is

 6   because the perspective is that we need a

 7   women veterans coordinator.   Well, we need to

 8   deal with the issues that are sensitive to

 9   women in an inclusive way because they are

10   also veterans.

11         So my approach is to peel back this

12   with strategy and efforts that integrate our

13   lines of activities, recognizing that our

14   responsibility is to be inclusive, equitable

15   and accommodating to all.   And that's the

16   approach that I will take in bringing these

17   programs to life in the State of New York.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Well, and

19   specifically issues that often -- like

20   childcare, you know, just need to be kind of

21   taken out of the mix and addressed.   So I

22   hope, you know, that that's part of it too.

23         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Things like

24   expanding our hours.   There's several ways to
                                                         283

 1   be accommodating to those who work, who are

 2   single parents, childcare.

 3          You know, my colleague Mark Schroeder

 4   in DMV had to expand office hours and do

 5   things that traditionally government wouldn't

 6   think of doing with all the rules behind

 7   the -- we have to be accommodating.     We have

 8   to be accessible.   We have to be

 9   approachable.

10          The Governor has challenged every one

11   of us with engaging better with our

12   stakeholders and our constituencies.      That

13   was the message we received in the most

14   recent cabinet meeting.    That's me.   You

15   know, I want to get out in front of it as

16   much as I can.

17          ASSEMBLYWOMAN BARRETT:    Great.     Thank

18   you.   Thanks very much.

19          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes, ma'am.

20          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Senate?

21          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Hi, I'm going to

22   jump in probably just for one minute --

23          DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Yes, ma'am.

24          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     -- because
                                                        284

 1   Assemblyman Barrett just brought up an issue.

 2   So, you know, we're live-streaming, so that

 3   people are watching.   And they're texting.

 4   So they said as of a few weeks from now,

 5   there will be no women counselors in your

 6   system in all of New York City.     And I know

 7   what you said about wanting to make sure you

 8   have the broadest diversity in treating

 9   everybody equally.   But there's got to be

10   issues women veterans feel more comfortable

11   talking to a woman counselor about.

12            So could you please double-check that

13   for me, because this is --

14            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Oh, no, I

15   have women veterans benefits advisors based

16   in New York City and Long Island.

17            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   So I'm being told

18   that that's not going to be true --

19            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   I run the

20   place.

21            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   -- that there

22   will be administrative staff left, but as of

23   February there will be no -- because you

24   closed one office and they have just
                                                        285

 1   St. Albans?

 2         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    No,

 3   St. Albans, we moved that benefits

 4   counselor -- we will, once her appointments

 5   free up, she's moving out to Hicksville in

 6   Nassau County.   We will be backfilling her.

 7   So that's underway right now, ma'am.

 8         So the young lady's name is Kristin,

 9   she's a good veterans benefits advisor.

10   We're moving her to a Hicksville office

11   because we have no presence there.     Again, my

12   resources are somewhat malpositioned.    But I

13   will backfill that office, so.

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    So how many

15   counselors do you have in New York City?

16         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Ma'am, I have

17   about 80 veterans benefits advisors, the

18   majority of which are in and around New York

19   City and the Lower Hudson Valley.

20         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    So you don't know

21   for specifically in the five boroughs, how

22   many --

23         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    The five

24   boroughs?   I can get you that answer, ma'am,
                                                           286

 1   so -- I will.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:         Because there's

 3   quite a few women veterans in New York City,

 4   I run into them all the time.

 5         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:        Yeah, my --

 6   my -- the person I just spoke of is based in

 7   Brooklyn.     So the lion's share of my staff

 8   are located in or around New York City and

 9   Long Island.

10         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:         Thank you.   I

11   look forward --

12         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:        Yes, ma'am,

13   I'll get you the information.

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:         -- to getting the

15   follow-up information.    Thank you.

16         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:        But that is

17   not true.    We do have women veterans

18   advisors.

19         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:         Thank you.

20         Okay, we'll keep going with the

21   Senate.     Senator Sue Serino.

22         SENATOR SERINO:     Good afternoon,

23   Commissioner.    Thank you so much for being

24   here today.
                                                        287

 1            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Thank you.

 2            SENATOR SERINO:   And I basically have

 3   more a couple of statements.

 4            I just wanted to say I agree

 5   wholeheartedly with Senator Brooks, I think

 6   we're sending the wrong message to our

 7   veterans.    You know, they have to schlep up

 8   here to tell us what they want when we know

 9   what they need and want and what actually

10   works.    The Dwyer funding has been

11   phenomenal, I know, in our district.

12            And it goes through working with

13   Mental Health America.     When you think of all

14   of the suicides and the increase -- I'm

15   someone who lost a brother to suicide.      He

16   wasn't a veteran, but I understand the mental

17   health issue of it, and that's key.     And to

18   not have this in every single county and to

19   not have it in the Executive Budget is like a

20   slap in the face to these guys and gals that

21   fought for us.

22            The other concern that I have too is I

23   spoke to Commissioner Hein earlier -- very

24   excited about the $5 million for the homeless
                                                         288

 1   veterans.    But with the way it's written, if

 2   it's not -- if they're not getting the

 3   proposals in, that could be drawn back.      And

 4   when you think about it, I think you said

 5   26 counties have the Dwyer money.

 6         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       That's

 7   correct.

 8         SENATOR SERINO:       And I know our guys

 9   and gals have their finger on the pulse of

10   what they need.    They know the homeless

11   veterans.    So those other counties could be

12   missing out and not -- you know, not be

13   involved as much like to have this resource

14   to be able to tell you guys what they need.

15         So I'm just really worried about that.

16   I'd love to see that eliminated.      I'd love to

17   see your support on both of those counts.

18   You seem like somebody -- you get it, you've

19   been there --

20         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       I do, yeah.

21         SENATOR SERINO:       -- you've got the

22   heart for it, and now we just need to fight

23   for it.     So thank you.

24         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       You're
                                                          289

 1   welcome.   And both Senator Brooks and

 2   Assemblymember Barrett know my commitment to

 3   working with them and the veterans committees

 4   to kind of improve upon the service delivery.

 5   So thank you for that.

 6           SENATOR SERINO:   Great, thank you.

 7   Thank you, Commissioner.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Thank you.   And

 9   to close, Senator Velmanette Montgomery.

10           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   {Mic off;

11   inaudible.}

12           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   Hello, ma'am.

13   Thank you.

14           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   Hi, I'm sorry.     I

15   would be remiss if I didn't mention the group

16   that I always talk about, and I want to start

17   by thanking you for the attention that you

18   pay the group that we in Brooklyn consider

19   our veterans organization, Black Vets for

20   Social Justice, that --

21           DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:   I know them

22   well.

23           SENATOR MONTGOMERY:   -- you know very

24   well, yes.    And I thank you for that.
                                                        290

 1         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       Good friends

 2   with Wendy.

 3         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     Yes, great.

 4         And you mentioned -- I see 5 million

 5   for housing for veterans.    That's wonderful.

 6   We certainly would like to see much more, but

 7   at least it's on your agenda --

 8         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       Yes, ma'am.

 9         SENATOR MONTGOMERY:      --   and we

10   appreciate that.

11         I want to just say to you that I have

12   two armories in my district that house men,

13   African-American black and brown men,

14   basically, and many of those men are

15   veterans.     So the need for housing is just

16   absolutely tremendous.    And it seems to me

17   that an organization like Black Vets would be

18   ideal as a -- to partner and consider doing

19   some housing around, you know, veterans'

20   needs that would be housing and support

21   services in a supportive housing fashion.

22         So I just wanted to put that on

23   your --

24         DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:       Thank you.
                                                           291

 1            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     -- your agenda,

 2   and hopefully we can talk about that at some

 3   point.

 4            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     I'd welcome

 5   the conversation.    I'll get down there and

 6   speak with you.    And they're good old friends

 7   of mine, so.

 8            SENATOR MONTGOMERY:     Great.   Thank you

 9   very much.

10            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:    Yes, ma'am.

11            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

12            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

13   That concludes questions, thank you.

14            DVS DIRECTOR McDONOUGH:     Thank you

15   very much.

16            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

17   being here today with us.

18            So now we begin the public portion

19   of -- the nongovernmental witness portion of

20   our hearing.    Just as -- the first witness

21   will be Gail Myers from New York StateWide

22   Senior Action Council, to be followed by

23   UJA-Federation of New York, Association on

24   Aging in New York.
                                                      292

 1           I just encourage people, as you're

 2   getting close to speaking, to make your way

 3   down.   And a reminder, just in timing, the

 4   witnesses have up to five minutes and members

 5   have three minutes if you choose to ask a

 6   question.

 7           Gail, go ahead.

 8           MS. MYERS:   Thank you very much.

 9           I really appreciate the opportunity to

10   testify today, and thank you all for the work

11   you do to support the needs of older

12   New Yorkers.

13           I will not be reading my very detailed

14   and extensive testimony, because I know you

15   will as soon as I leave, but I want to give a

16   special shout-out to Senator Montgomery for

17   her many years of leadership and advocacy for

18   vulnerable populations.   So thank you for

19   that.

20           I'll start with the two programs that

21   we have that are funded through the New York

22   State Office for the Aging.   One is our

23   patients' rights and advocacy hotline, and

24   the other is our managed-care consumer
                                                       293

 1   assistance program.     We have details on our

 2   programs and the services that we offer, but

 3   I want to get to the budget ask.    And the

 4   budget ask is for the Legislature to restore

 5   our program to the current fiscal year level

 6   as you're contemplating next fiscal year.

 7            The Executive put in the budget for

 8   $31,500 to run our program, and the last two

 9   years the Legislature has added $100,000 to

10   that, which we very much appreciate and need.

11            Secondly, we ask you to reappropriate

12   the $100,000 that you put in the budget in

13   '19-'20 because, due to problems in

14   contracting, we still have not gotten that

15   money.    So please have it roll over, because

16   the loss of that and services already done

17   would be devastating.

18            The second thing is our managed-care

19   consumer assistance program.    We have a line

20   in the budget, along with six other agencies,

21   to provide services and counseling to older

22   New Yorkers.    We -- in addition to what we do

23   for Medicare and EPIC enrollment, we also

24   provide enrollment assistance in the Medicare
                                                     294

 1   Savings Program, which I will be talking

 2   about in some more depth, and that gives

 3   low-income Medicare enrollees premium relief

 4   and also extra help, which is the federal

 5   program for prescription drug assistance,

 6   100 percent funded -- that last part by the

 7   feds.

 8           What is disturbing is that only

 9   38 percent of currently eligible New Yorkers

10   are receiving that benefit.   That is far

11   under the national average of 51 percent, and

12   it makes us sixth from the bottom in the

13   country of states that have penetrated moving

14   up in enrollment on that.   So because of

15   that, we're asking for the MCCAP programs to

16   receive $1 million of additional funding

17   spread out among our six not-for-profit

18   agencies so that we can increase the

19   opportunity to get people enrolled in the

20   necessary benefit.

21           Now I wanted to talk a little bit

22   about unmet needs.   The $15 million that was

23   added to the budget by the Governor, and that

24   you all worked very hard to have included
                                                     295

 1   last year -- and it is back in the budget

 2   again this year -- addresses need.     But we

 3   think it really focuses on past waiting

 4   lists, and there is so much more to do to

 5   ensure access to services for older

 6   New Yorkers based on the demographic data.

 7         Now, we very much thank Senators

 8   Persaud and May for your committees' work and

 9   holding that hearing on poverty, and also for

10   Mr. Bronson and the Aging Committee in the

11   Assembly for holding a hearing on services

12   in -- this fall.   It really helped -- and of

13   course your staffs.   It really helped us

14   focus on being able to report to you, and as

15   a result we've completed a county-by-county

16   compilation of data regarding older residents

17   who may be relying or need to rely on aging

18   services.   And I don't think we should be

19   shocked, as we're seeing the very, very

20   predictable high use of long-term care in the

21   Medicaid budget, we should also be able to

22   predict that the same is true for people who

23   have been relying on aging services.

24         So based on the census for New York
                                                      296

 1   statewide -- as I said, we have this county

 2   by county -- but in the state we've got

 3   33 percent of older residents, 65 and older,

 4   living with a disability -- 65 and older,

 5   about 9 percent have difficult in self-care,

 6   about 6 percent have difficulty in

 7   independent living.   Those are people that

 8   would be, depending on their income and

 9   eligibility, prime candidates for expanded

10   services from the Offices for Aging.

11           From the GAO report from the federal

12   government, they looked at the services

13   funded by the Older Americans Act, which

14   comes into the state -- in large part funds

15   NYSOFA services -- they found, of

16   food-insecure older adults, 83 percent of

17   them do not receive any meals from aging

18   funding services.   Two-thirds of older

19   Americans who struggle with activities of

20   daily living receive limited or no home-based

21   care.   Twenty percent of older Americans are

22   potentially at risk for needing

23   transportation.

24           Now, that information from the GAO was
                                                     297

 1   being used by our Congress's committee to

 2   look at funding for the Older Americans Act.

 3   And the House of Representatives has

 4   recommended that for the first of five

 5   years -- something's broken with the clock.

 6         (Laughter.)

 7         MS. MYERS:    For the first of five

 8   years there needs to be a 7 percent increase,

 9   and 6 percent increases in the years that

10   follow.

11         We have recommendations on capacity

12   and reporting, we have recommendations on

13   increasing the home-care worker shortage,

14   initiatives, and ask for a $15 million

15   investment over three years.

16         We have concerns about the

17   long-term-care ombudsman program.   There was

18   a 37 percent decrease in volunteers in that

19   program.

20         And then on the last two issues --

21   very, very quickly, sorry -- we have

22   proposals that we will talk to the Health

23   Committees, Ways and Means, and Finance about

24   on how to achieve some savings on the
                                                             298

 1   Medicaid side of the budget by expanding the

 2   Medicare savings program and also by

 3   improving eligibility requirements.         The

 4   State of Louisiana took one option and saved

 5   $2 million per year, so we think there are

 6   some savings to be had there that would

 7   improve benefits for seniors.

 8           And we ask you to look at the EPIC

 9   program to improve the transparency and

10   accountability surrounding the programmatic

11   changes, because there have been some

12   things -- including our concern about the

13   second year of a proposed cut in the program

14   where there have been benefits that have been

15   cut within EPIC -- that we would like to see

16   restored.

17           Thank you.    Sorry.

18           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.     You

19   were very comprehensive.       We have no

20   questions.

21           You've got to talk faster next year,

22   Gail.

23           (Laughter.)

24           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.
                                                       299

 1          Next we will have UJA-Federation of

 2   New York.

 3          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Sorry.   Sorry.

 4   We have a question.

 5          Chair Rachel May.

 6          SENATOR MAY:   Thank you, Gail.   And

 7   thank you for mentioning the Home Care Jobs

 8   Innovation Fund.   I think that's an important

 9   one.

10          I wanted to follow up about the

11   hearing we had about SNAP and low-income

12   New Yorkers.   But we talked a lot about the

13   senior issues, and most of what came out of

14   that hearing -- because we held it before the

15   federal government cut those benefits, and

16   basically what everyone was saying is we've

17   got to make sure the federal government

18   doesn't do that.   And that was basically the

19   outcome of that hearing.   But they did it

20   anyway.

21          So are you already seeing any results

22   from that?   And what should we be doing?    It

23   was very frustrating to come out of that and

24   say all we can do is stop the federal
                                                          300

 1   government from doing this.

 2            MS. MYERS:     Well, there could be an

 3   investment -- when I look at this, I look at

 4   it from a senior perspective, because that's

 5   the population that we deal with mostly.       But

 6   of course this affects children and everybody

 7   in New York State.

 8            But from a senior perspective, I think

 9   that an investment increase in what's called

10   the WIN program within Aging, which is

11   wellness and nutrition, would help to offset

12   some of the food insecurity that we're seeing

13   among seniors.    Calls that we're getting --

14   what we find is that the anxiety level raised

15   in a very large way as a result of the

16   potential for federal cuts -- I haven't

17   gotten calls recently about people saying "I

18   don't have the benefits that I need," but we

19   do get calls to say "Where can I go for

20   food?"

21            SENATOR MAY:    Okay.   Thank you.

22            And then the one other thing I wanted

23   to ask about was -- oh, the 7 percent

24   increase that you recommend for over what the
                                                          301

 1   core NYSOFA programs -- how is 7 percent

 2   arrived at?    Why is that the amount?

 3            MS. MYERS:     Well, we felt that the GAO

 4   was a pretty good source and that was what

 5   U.S. House of Representatives used as their

 6   source for making a recommendation that the

 7   federal government should invest 7 percent

 8   followed by 6 percent in each of the four

 9   consecutive years.

10            So I guess I figured if it was good

11   enough for the House of Representatives, it

12   was good enough for statewide as an initial

13   recommendation, knowing how tight money is.

14   We think that should be a minimum and that

15   you should continue to grow these services

16   across the board, year after year.      So we

17   followed the federal recommendation of the

18   house.

19            SENATOR MAY:    Okay, great.   Thank you

20   very much.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Assemblyman

22   Bronson.

23            ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Gail -- and you

24   thought you were going to get away.      In your
                                                       302

 1   materials you have a couple of sections that

 2   talk about Medicaid.   And as you know, one of

 3   the most serious issues we're going to face

 4   during the budget is the Medicaid situation.

 5   And I use "situation" intentionally.

 6         Could you share with us how we in the

 7   area of serving older New Yorkers, how can we

 8   work toward Medicaid savings in particular?

 9   And, you know, the connection between

10   Medicaid and Medicare and your services of

11   getting people on benefits -- if you wouldn't

12   mind, just outline for us how we can address

13   Medicaid and help that benefit our system as

14   we move forward.

15         MS. MYERS:   All right.   Well, I think

16   there's two areas that I would point to.    One

17   is the CMS has already made recommendations

18   to the states on how they can improve their

19   eligibility and processing of people who have

20   the Medicare Savings Program.   That is funded

21   in part by our state Medicaid and the local

22   social services districts doing the work.

23         So the first would be:    Achieve all

24   the savings you can by streamlining and
                                                      303

 1   improving that process, which would also stop

 2   people from the churning off-cycle by having

 3   to reapply and so on.   First thing.

 4         And the second thing, we think that

 5   most people come to the Offices for Aging

 6   when they are beginning to enter a crisis

 7   situation.   I need this, how do I get it?

 8   And there's a lot more that can be done,

 9   number one, to prevent moving into that

10   crisis situation through programs that the

11   offices offer.

12         But also, in terms of averting that

13   crisis mentality, we need to let people know

14   that the services are there.   People don't

15   know -- they call our office, they call our

16   hotline, and we're speaking to them and we

17   refer them back to their county Offices for

18   Aging -- who are doing great work.     People

19   just don't know:   Oh, that's available to me?

20   Oh, that's how I would get that?

21         And we do educate people earlier on

22   and do more outreach, which we think we need

23   for all of our programs.   That should

24   delay -- it should keep people healthier and
                                                       304

 1   we hope should delay Medicaid eligibility or

 2   their crisis where they enter into a hospital

 3   and then never go home.

 4         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Okay.   And we

 5   have less than a minute, but on the EPIC

 6   program, what is your suggestion on how we

 7   expand EPIC so more seniors can take

 8   advantage of that?

 9         MS. MYERS:     Well, there are two pieces

10   that have happened this year.   One is a new

11   application which requires a lot of detailed

12   information that was not previously required.

13   It is going to, we think, be a disincentive

14   for people to enroll in EPIC.   So we'd like

15   you to fix that.

16         The other thing is rather than using

17   the line of the Governor's cut, to restore

18   that money and then to start lowering the age

19   of EPIC eligibility from 65 down, so that

20   people as they are entering seniorhood are

21   coming in with the resources that they need.

22   Everyone on EPIC, everyone on Medicare, which

23   is including the persons with disabilities

24   population, should have the same benefit, and
                                                        305

 1   we'd like to see that expanded to everyone.

 2         There are some bracket changes that

 3   could be made.    The regs on EPIC allow a

 4   cost-of-living adjustment, which has not been

 5   made in recent memory.    Things like not

 6   throwing someone off because they have just a

 7   little bit more money because they've gotten

 8   a COLA increase in their pension or Social

 9   Security.

10         So there are numerous

11   recommendations --

12         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Right.

13         MS. MYERS:      -- but we'd like to see

14   more transparency and accountability in the

15   system.     There used to be a consumer advisory

16   panel that doesn't exist anymore.    That would

17   help bring in more seniors into the program.

18   And the program has declined significantly in

19   their outreach, from nine outreach workers in

20   the past to I think three now across the

21   entire state.    People don't know about the

22   program, that it's there for them.

23         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Thank you.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.
                                                          306

 1            MS. MYERS:    Can I leave this time?

 2            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Now you can

 3   leave.    We're not going to call you back.

 4            (Laughter.)

 5            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Ariel

 6   Savransky, advocacy and policy advisor,

 7   UJA-Federation.

 8            MS. SAVRANSKY:   Good afternoon.    Thank

 9   you for the opportunity to testify.      I'm just

10   going to touch on a few points from my

11   testimony as you have the full, longer

12   testimony in front of you.

13            On behalf of UJA-Federation of

14   New York, our network of nonprofit partners

15   and those we serve, thank you for the

16   opportunity to testify on the importance of

17   maintaining and expanding support for the

18   human services sector.

19            Established more than 100 years ago,

20   UJA is one of the nation's largest local

21   philanthropies.    We support a network of

22   nearly 100 nonprofit organizations serving

23   those that are the most vulnerable and in

24   need of programs and services.
                                                      307

 1         UJA's network of nonprofit partners

 2   delivers programs, services, and resources

 3   that support the well being of all

 4   New Yorkers across their lifespan.   However,

 5   while New York's economy has been growing

 6   steadily since 2008, state funding for the

 7   human services sector has been cut by

 8   26 percent.   This leaves a lot of our

 9   partners unable to provide the services that

10   vulnerable individuals need.

11         We make the following recommendations

12   for investments in this year's state budget,

13   including a 3 percent increase on all human

14   services contracts and rates for the next

15   five years; allocating $100 million in

16   recurring funds to the Nonprofit

17   Infrastructure Capital Investment Program;

18   and expanding State and Municipal Facilities

19   Program eligibility guidelines to include

20   nonprofit organizations.

21         Additionally, Medicaid has been

22   discussed a lot.   While the Medicaid Redesign

23   Team has been tasked with identifying

24   $2.5 billion in savings to the state, should
                                                       308

 1   that not be achieved, it is critical that

 2   nonprofit providers are held harmless.

 3         I also want to touch on Holocaust

 4   survivors.    New York State is home to nearly

 5   40,000 Holocaust survivors.    Forty percent of

 6   them live below the poverty level.    As

 7   New York continues to support its immigrant

 8   communities and address the rise in

 9   antisemitism and hate crimes, it is

10   imperative that we not leave Holocaust

11   survivors behind. We appreciate the

12   investment of $400,000 in last year's budget,

13   but more must be done.   We ask the state to

14   invest $5 million to fund care, services, and

15   resources for Holocaust survivors living in

16   poverty.

17         Along those same lines, we appreciate

18   the inclusion of $25 million to support the

19   safety and security projects for at-risk

20   facilities.    We request that eligibility

21   guidelines for this funding be expanded to

22   all nonprofits that are at risk due to their

23   beliefs or ideology, including houses of

24   worship.   This will provide a broader
                                                        309

 1   understanding of statewide community

 2   vulnerabilities and ensure that all

 3   nonprofits are protected from hate-based

 4   attacks.

 5         Next I want to talk about the Summer

 6   Youth Employment Program.   We thank you for

 7   the proposal to provide a $1 million increase

 8   for SYEP to cover the minimum wage increase.

 9         However, as Senator Savino brought up

10   earlier, there is an issue with the

11   Article VII language that was enacted by the

12   '19-'20 budget that implemented new,

13   comprehensive background checks for both new

14   and current employees at school-aged

15   childcare licensed programs statewide, and

16   this includes SYEP programs.   Because of

17   these new regulations, there is a huge

18   backlog in the processing of these background

19   checks, and it often takes months for a

20   background check to be -- to go through.     For

21   a six-week program, which is what SYEP is,

22   this creates real barriers to ensuring that

23   these programs can be staffed and that these

24   kids can have the opportunity to participate
                                                     310

 1   in the program.

 2         Before the regulations were in place,

 3   providers waited only two weeks for completed

 4   background checks.   Due to the complexity of

 5   the new background checks, OCFS and local

 6   registrars require additional resources and

 7   staff to be able to perform the background

 8   checks in a timely manner.     Providers also

 9   require more guidance on the background check

10   process, specifically on how to properly stop

11   their program if the process is not expedited

12   by the time the SYEP students have to start

13   their job placements.

14         And lastly, I just want to talk about

15   food insecurity for a second.    UJA

16   appreciates the inclusion of a new initiative

17   to reduce food insecurity among college

18   students that Commissioner Hein mentioned in

19   his testimony earlier today.    This will

20   really ensure that we can combat food

21   insecurity on these campuses.    We urge OTDA

22   to ensure that the policy is changed in this

23   budget cycle.   And we also urge the state to

24   consider ways to expand this to all college
                                                      311

 1   students, as food insecurity is a real

 2   problem, not just in community colleges.

 3            I also want to emphasize what my

 4   colleagues who spoke before me said about

 5   increasing WIN funding, which is another way

 6   to combat -- to reduce Medicaid costs as

 7   well.

 8            And then, just along the lines of the

 9   SNAP attacks on the federal level, we have

10   already started to see the reducing -- people

11   reducing their use of SNAP benefits and thus

12   relying more on food pantries, so that is

13   something that we really need to make sure to

14   fill some of those gaps.

15            Thank you for the opportunity to

16   testify, and I'm happy to take any questions.

17            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

18   Thank you for being here today.

19            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

20            MS. SAVRANSKY:   Thank you.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Next we have

22   the Association on Aging in New York, Rebecca

23   Preve.    (Pause.)

24            Okay.   I'm sorry, yes, please go
                                                        312

 1   ahead.

 2            MS. PREVE:   Good afternoon.   I wanted

 3   to say thank you to members of the

 4   Legislature for holding such an important

 5   hearing.

 6            My name is Becky Preve, and I'm the

 7   executive director at the Association on

 8   Aging in New York.    Our membership contains

 9   the 59 local area agencies on aging,

10   otherwise known to you as Offices for the

11   Aging -- I know there's at times confusion.

12   Out mission is to support and enhance the

13   Offices for the Aging to promote

14   independence, preserve dignity, and advocate

15   on behalf of older New Yorkers.

16            We serve a large number of people, and

17   we serve in four different categories.     So

18   our first category is really active older

19   New Yorkers.    We provide volunteer

20   opportunities.    They engage in our senior

21   centers for health promotion activities.      We

22   also touch those with small needs -- so

23   individuals that may need help with their

24   Medicare, they may need some counseling
                                                       313

 1   services, they might need to get enrolled in

 2   new plans, and they're kind of a soft touch

 3   in our community.

 4         We also serve the high-risk frail

 5   elderly.    And so Commissioner Olsen spoke to

 6   this; under our core programs and services,

 7   we're typically serving clients at very high

 8   needs, early eighties, single females that

 9   live alone who have real deficits in being

10   able to bathe, dress, go to the grocery

11   store, et cetera.    We also have a very strong

12   caregiver support program and provide respite

13   services.

14         I want to kind of start the

15   conversation by doing a level set on this

16   aging population, and I think Commissioner

17   Olsen also spoke to this.    So this population

18   has a huge social, intellectual, and economic

19   footprint in New York State.    New York State

20   is fourth in the nation as far as our aging

21   population, and in 2015 we had 3.6 million

22   people over the age of 60.     By 2040, we're

23   going to be looking at 5.6 million in that

24   category.    By 2025, 86 percent of counties in
                                                      314

 1   New York State will have a population that's

 2   25 percent or more over the age of 60.

 3           Again, this population contributes

 4   enormously across our service spectrum.    The

 5   50+ Longevity Economy indicates that the

 6   population over 50 represents $9 trillion in

 7   economic and unpaid activities from 2018.

 8   That's going to triple to $28 trillion by

 9   2050.   What that means for New York State is

10   that individuals over the age of 45

11   contribute $379 billion per year to our

12   economic situation.   That's 63 percent of the

13   income in New York State from this

14   population.

15           Their volunteerism is worth over

16   $13 billion per year, and their unpaid

17   caregiving has a value of about $32 billion

18   to the state.   This kind of lays the

19   framework for why New Yorkers really deserve

20   the care and services that we're able to

21   provide them, and it's also the reason that

22   I'm here today to ask for an ongoing

23   commitment to our aging network.

24           The $15 million in last year's budget
                                                      315

 1   allowed my members to bring older adults

 2   services that were on waiting lists, some

 3   from two months to three years.    That meant

 4   home-delivered meals, transportation,

 5   personal care services, and other vital

 6   services to our economic drivers in New York

 7   State.

 8            My membership also shared kind of a

 9   deep data dive, so we looked into actual case

10   files.    And out of the 2,200 case files that

11   we looked at, 10 percent of those individuals

12   went directly to a skilled nursing facility

13   under the Medicaid benefit; another 9 percent

14   went to MLTC plans or traditional Medicaid

15   coverage.

16            Again, if you look at that from an

17   economic standpoint, the state's share of

18   Medicaid on those people is over $60 million

19   per year, so very, very significant

20   statistics.

21            What I'm asking for this year is the

22   fact that my membership have reported to me

23   ongoing waitlist issues.   And so what that

24   means is that the waitlist was a snapshot in
                                                        316

 1   time, we had that data from a few years back,

 2   but that doesn't mean our waitlists stop.     So

 3   people continually come on our waitlists and

 4   the membership reports that, and we currently

 5   have a large sum back on our waiting lists.

 6          So the ask behind the 19.5 million in

 7   my testimony is directly tied to the

 8   9,000-plus people we have identified on

 9   waitlists, and the calculation is based on

10   what a unit of service costs for that

11   individual.   So there's metrics behind the

12   ask.

13          I also took a deep look at our CSE

14   budget, and I know that there's been asks for

15   an increase in that.   Again, I really feel

16   that we have clients behind these numbers,

17   and so we do ask for a $53 million investment

18   in CSE.   And that's for two things.

19          Number one is targeted case

20   management.   So the people that receive our

21   home-care services and case management, those

22   are exactly those very high risk, frail

23   individuals who qualify for a skilled nursing

24   facility placement.    Right now, on average,
                                                         317

 1   they get one hour of case management per

 2   month.    And again, with the issues that we

 3   see with the older population, one hour

 4   really is not sufficient to meet the needs.

 5   So 10 million could bump that to two hours of

 6   case management.

 7            The additional funding again goes

 8   directly to our personal care program, so the

 9   home health aides that assist with bathing,

10   toileting, dressing, feeding -- and our

11   average client only gets 4.6 hours per week.

12   The Medicaid system usually authorizes

13   20-plus.    So the ask behind that investment

14   would be directly for increasing our

15   home-care hours from the typical 4.6 to an

16   average of 10 for New York State.

17            Our services and supports are

18   predicated on keeping people off

19   Medicaid-covered services, and yet our

20   funding has remained relatively stagnant.      We

21   provide services that keep people living in

22   their homes and support the population that

23   is the economic support New York State

24   thrives on.
                                                     318

 1         I would like to thank all of you for

 2   your time, and I welcome any questions.

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 4         Any Assembly?   Assemblymember Bronson.

 5         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Thank you.

 6         I've talked about this earlier with

 7   other witnesses.   But your numbers show that

 8   an average cost in the nursing home is

 9   $150,000 annually for an individual, whereas

10   if we have a community-based services for

11   individuals who would qualify to go into a

12   nursing home, those costs are $6,300

13   annually.

14         Tie that to the fact that even though

15   with the $15 million we addressed --

16   whatever, I can't remember what it was, the

17   2017 or 2018 waitlist -- but now you have

18   identified somewheres above 9,000 people on

19   the waitlist.   How -- in those kind of

20   savings, if we can keep people at home, safe

21   with a quality of life, how does that impact

22   on Medicaid -- and shouldn't we be talking

23   about that, number one?

24         And then, number two, do consumers
                                                       319

 1   have a voice on the Medicaid Redesign Team

 2   II?   Do -- you know, are agencies like yours,

 3   is there a voice there for Medicaid Redesign

 4   Team II?   I mean, we need voices to make this

 5   argument as we're making the decision between

 6   now and April.

 7          MS. PREVE:   Absolutely.   I couldn't

 8   agree more.

 9          And I can tell you our population is

10   traditionally non-Medicaid, and our services

11   and supports -- you know, they don't last a

12   month or two.    So we're keeping people out of

13   skilled nursing facilities for years.

14          So the aggregate cost savings that I

15   quoted, that's only for one year of the cost

16   savings.   So if you look at someone on the

17   EISEP program that we've kept on for

18   three years, you know, you triple that

19   amount.

20          And so, you know, as far as the

21   MRT II, I absolutely feel that the consumer

22   and advocate portion of New York State needs

23   to be included in that conversation, and I

24   absolutely think, again, in the climate of
                                                       320

 1   Medicaid that we're looking at right now, our

 2   services are tried and true and they're

 3   proven that they absolutely can keep people

 4   off Medicaid.

 5           ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:    Thank you very

 6   much.

 7           MS. PREVE:     You're welcome.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 9            Senator May.

10           (Mic problems.)

11           SENATOR MAY:    Thank you, Rebecca.

12           I just have one quick question.      Of

13   the 9,000 number that you have of people on

14   the waiting list, how does that compare to

15   what it was before the $15 million was put

16   in?    How many people came off the waiting

17   list as a result of the investment?

18           MS. PREVE:   So we were actually able

19   to get over what we anticipated off the

20   waitlist.    So it was over 8,000 that came

21   off.    And I think the 9,000 that we now have

22   on is a combination of numerous things.       I

23   think it's value-based payments.

24           So people are really looking, from the
                                                          321

 1   healthcare sector, on getting people on

 2   services sooner.     So our referrals from

 3   hospitals and the physician base have

 4   absolutely increased, and then our

 5   NY Connects program has grown enormously.       We

 6   have a very large online presence now, so

 7   people definitely are coming to our services

 8   at an earlier time.     And I think there was a

 9   lot of press involved with the historic

10   investment that we received, and so people

11   really were in tune to the fact that our

12   services absolutely could help their loved

13   ones.

14           So, you know, as the aging population

15   continues to grow, our waitlists are going to

16   continue to grow just because of the basis of

17   the population that we're serving.

18           SENATOR MAY:    So Gail Myers testified

19   that we're maybe not doing the best job of

20   getting the word out about what the services

21   are that are available.    Can you say what you

22   find is working and what is needed in order

23   to make it work better?

24           MS. PREVE:    I definitely think that
                                                      322

 1   social media has played a huge role.    Our

 2   membership has absolutely started advertising

 3   their services on Facebook, tweeting, those

 4   types of things, so I think we're catching

 5   maybe the younger caregivers that might not

 6   use traditional ways of getting information.

 7   And I think our NY Connects marketing plan

 8   has been very successful.

 9           And again, it's one of those things

10   that there are many times where people don't

11   want to plan or think about the future when

12   they do have needs, and so some people kind

13   of put blinders up until they're in that

14   crisis mode.

15           SENATOR MAY:   Okay.   Thank you very

16   much.

17           MS. PREVE:   You're welcome.

18           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

19           Senator Sue Serino.

20           (Mic problems.)

21           SENATOR SERINO:   Hello.   Sorry about

22   that.   I can't get the mic to work.

23           But I just have to commend you on the

24   incredibly thorough testimony that you put
                                                        323

 1   here today.   If my colleagues haven't gotten

 2   a chance to look this over, it's amazing.

 3   You really break it down for us, and I really

 4   appreciate it.

 5         And in here you rightly point out that

 6   our senior population will virtually double

 7   in the next 20 years, and keeping our seniors

 8   here will be vital to our economic viability.

 9   I completely agree.

10         So I wanted to start by talking about

11   the CSE funds.   A couple of people have

12   mentioned it already, and you know we were

13   excited to get the $15 million, but what do

14   you see?   Do you think that we're going to

15   need more money?   Like you talked about doing

16   more on social media, and more -- you know,

17   you're hitting other people, maybe a little

18   bit younger, too, than notoriously {sic}

19   would take the money.   And if you think we do

20   need more, do you have any idea of an amount?

21         MS. PREVE:    Of the CSE funds?

22         SENATOR SERINO:   CSE.

23         MS. PREVE:    So the CSE -- that's

24   included in the testimony.     It might not just
                                                       324

 1   be laid out --

 2           SENATOR SERINO:   Oh, maybe I'm --

 3   okay.

 4           MS. PREVE:    But the CSE ask that we

 5   came up with of the 53 million, I felt it was

 6   really important to have data behind that

 7   number, to have a specific ask, because I

 8   think that's beneficial for you to make

 9   decisions.

10           And so that was directly tied to our

11   highest-risk customers, so those individuals

12   that have three deficits in activities of

13   daily living, three deficits in independent

14   activities of daily living, and four or more

15   chronic conditions.    So that was based

16   directly on this population, and the

17   calculation was to double their case

18   management and to essentially double their

19   home care hours per week.

20           SENATOR SERINO:   Okay.   That's great.

21           And then the other question that I

22   have, because I was really intrigued by your

23   home-care innovation fund that you're

24   proposing in your testimony -- so can you
                                                      325

 1   elaborate a little on your vision for that

 2   too?

 3          MS. PREVE:   Sure.   So the home health

 4   aide crisis --   in my previous work I was a

 5   director of a local AAA, and we actually

 6   worked very closely on the home care crisis

 7   coalitions.   So we did some deep diving into

 8   this a while back, and what home health aides

 9   had shared with us were a couple of things

10   that could be an easy fix with a pilot

11   project.   So it was "New tires for my car" or

12   "A lease" or "I don't have anyone to care for

13   my child if I have a case from 6 to 9 p.m.,

14   because my traditional daycare isn't open."

15   So I think that there's a lot of work that

16   could be done in that space.

17          I think the other thing that was

18   eye-opening for me personally is two of the

19   members of my staff were previously home

20   health aides and went back to school and came

21   out as case managers.   And I asked them:   If

22   you got paid the same amount of money to do

23   case management or to provide direct care

24   service in the home, which would you choose?
                                                           326

 1   And they both laughed at me and said that

 2   they would be direct care workers immediately

 3   if they could make the same money.

 4            So I think that was kind of

 5   eye-opening to me, that if -- you know, if we

 6   can look to pilot a higher wage in certain

 7   areas and then really prove that those cases

 8   didn't go unfilled, again, that's some data

 9   to have behind what we're doing.        And I think

10   looking at those failed discharges from acute

11   care facilities, or people that are

12   readmitted, would be a really good place to

13   start.

14            SENATOR SERINO:    That's a great idea.

15   I love it.    Thank you.

16            MS. PREVE:    Thank you.

17            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

18            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

19            MS. PREVE:    Thank you very much.

20            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Next we have

21   Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy,

22   Dede Hill and Crystal Charles.

23            MS. HILL:    Hi.   Good afternoon.   Thank

24   you for this opportunity to testify.
                                                     327

 1         Since 1872, the Schuyler Center has

 2   been advocating to strengthen public systems

 3   that serve low-income and disenfranchised

 4   New Yorkers, particularly children and

 5   families.

 6         First I'd like to just make some

 7   general observations and create some context

 8   around this Executive Budget.   While this

 9   Executive Budget contains some important

10   proposals and new investments that will

11   benefit children and families, it is not a

12   budget that puts children and families first.

13   It's not a budget that, if enacted as is,

14   will meaningfully reduce New York's high rate

15   of child poverty.   It is not a budget that

16   will make any progress at all in addressing

17   the state's persistent childcare availability

18   crisis.

19         It appears that when the many proposed

20   cuts are implemented at the county level,

21   including the caps on Medicaid, many New York

22   families that are already facing the

23   obstacles of poverty and systematic racism

24   and ill health and disability, those families
                                                     328

 1   are going to be set back further.

 2         Turning to the specifics of the

 3   Executive Budget, there are a few issues that

 4   I want to highlight.   And I promise I'm not

 5   going to go through everything in our

 6   testimony, but there are a few things.

 7         First I want to just touch on

 8   something that is not in the budget, but we

 9   think that all New Yorkers -- and we'd like

10   your leadership in leading New York -- should

11   make a public, binding commitment to cutting

12   child poverty in half by 2030.   We think

13   New York has -- our child poverty rate has

14   sort of lingered around 20 percent for more

15   than a decade, and if we do not make a public

16   commitment and if we don't sort of start down

17   the path of incrementally reducing child

18   poverty, we will never tackle this problem.

19   So let's do this this year.

20         Turning to child welfare, there are a

21   number of proposals in this Executive Budget

22   that we applaud.   The kinship firewall is a

23   really important step.   Blind removals, this

24   is really going to move this state towards
                                                       329

 1   addressing its overrepresentation of black

 2   and brown children in the state's foster-care

 3   system.   These are important steps.

 4         But we do have some concerns.      I want

 5   to turn your attention to an issue that

 6   Senator Persaud has raised in her questions

 7   about -- there are cuts to the preventive

 8   protective funding stream.   They're kind of

 9   hard to discern in the budget.   But what it

10   looks like is done is there is a proposed

11   $40 million cut to the TANF Flexible Fund for

12   Family Services.   These are funds that we

13   understand counties use in a variety of ways,

14   including to support senior services, to

15   support childcare in some counties, to

16   support child welfare in some counties.    So

17   this is a $40 million cut that will deliver a

18   $25 million savings to the state.   It has to

19   be transferred over to preventive services.

20         We're also concerned that this may

21   mean that counties utilize their preventive

22   services a little bit less because they have

23   to draw down more county funds before they

24   can access those preventive services.
                                                       330

 1           We really want to draw attention to

 2   this.   I don't think it's on a lot of

 3   people's radars, and we are -- it's of deep

 4   concern to us.   And it reminds us of

 5   something that happened in 2017.    There was a

 6   proposal to shift $20 million in Title XX

 7   funds and move them to childcare.   We raised

 8   the alarm about that, and we actually

 9   reversed that.   We hope you will do that

10   again this year.

11           In the area of foster care, we're very

12   excited and pleased that there is continued

13   support for the Family First Transition Fund,

14   but we want to see some more investment this

15   year.

16           One other thing -- my time is running

17   out there -- there is no new funding in this

18   budget for childcare.    We have -- the

19   Governor convened a childcare availability

20   task force a year ago.   It's been working

21   hard, it has made some -- it is contemplating

22   some very ambitious proposals.   But even as

23   the task force is taking, you know, a

24   half-step forward and doing some really good
                                                        331

 1   thinking, the childcare system is crumbling

 2   around us.

 3         We are moving backwards, and so we are

 4   going to be starting at a deficit when we

 5   finally get recommendations a year from now.

 6   So we urge investment in childcare this year.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

 8         Assemblywoman Jaffee.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:      Yes.   The task

10   force, which I created and has been moving

11   forward, has really something we're going to

12   be meeting on to discuss their

13   recommendations, because I think that they

14   are recognizing that there are

15   some significant issues that -- of concern.

16         Regarding the childcare funding for

17   the childcare in the state, impacting the

18   children, obviously, and their future and

19   their families, who need to be able to have

20   the children in environments that are very

21   positive while they maintain their jobs and

22   their work, what specific numbers and issues

23   do you see with the budget that the Governor

24   has presented?   I have concerns about that
                                                       332

 1   also.   Could you provide some details?

 2           MS. HILL:   Yes.   With respect to

 3   childcare -- so I think that the headline,

 4   the most important message is there is no new

 5   state funding for childcare in the Executive

 6   Budget.   There has been some confusion, some

 7   suggestion in the Budget Briefing Book that

 8   the child tax credit proposal which -- and I

 9   want to be clear, we're very supportive.

10           There is a proposal to expand the

11   state's current child tax credit, which

12   currently omits children under the age of 4,

13   to expand the credit to include them, as it

14   should.   It's a child tax credit, it's

15   designed to offset the high cost of raising

16   children, it should include young children.

17           However, the child tax credit is not

18   designed nor is it robust enough to be an

19   answer to the childcare crisis.     At most, it

20   will provide a family between -- an extra

21   $333 a year in income.     Again, this can be

22   critical for a low-income family; if they

23   have a car that is not working, they can fix

24   it, they can go to work.    It's a critical
                                                      333

 1   step in efforts to reduce child poverty, but

 2   it is not a solution to the childcare crisis.

 3         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     And the other

 4   issue is workers in childcare.    There is --

 5   as I noted earlier, there is a very real

 6   issue in terms of having the availability of

 7   workers who can provide assistance and work

 8   within the childcare programs.    Is that

 9   something that you see of concern as well?

10         MS. HILL:   Yes.   So the other piece of

11   the childcare puzzle is that while childcare

12   is unaffordable for most New York families --

13   it costs an average of $15,000 a year -- at

14   the same time, the childcare workforce is

15   very underpaid.   Most of the -- 60 percent of

16   the workforce actually has to rely on some

17   sort of public assistance, because they are

18   paid wages that are that low.

19         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     So we need

20   to -- you know, certainly, thank you.   So we

21   need to certainly move forward in terms of

22   getting -- having the Governor provide more

23   funds for our childcare program and to be

24   able to also expand the opportunities for the
                                                       334

 1   salaries for our childcare workers so that we

 2   are able to have that kind of availability in

 3   programs to ensure that all of our children

 4   are in positive environments.

 5            But thank you.

 6            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you

 7   for --

 8            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Thank you so

 9   much.

10            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

11   being here.

12            MS. HILL:   Thank you.

13            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Next we have

14   the Council of Family and Child Care

15   Agencies, followed by Early Care and Learning

16   Council, followed by New York State Network

17   for Youth Success.

18            MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:   Good afternoon.

19   Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

20            My name is Kathleen Brady-Stepien, and

21   I'm the associate executive director of the

22   Council of Family and Child Care Agencies, or

23   COFCCA.    We represent the more than 100 child

24   welfare organizations around the state.
                                                     335

 1           We were very disappointed not to see

 2   more of a commitment to our human services

 3   programs in this Executive Budget proposal.

 4           We are proud to partner with our

 5   fellow human services organizations around

 6   the state to bring one single unified ask

 7   before you this year, and it's called #3for5.

 8   It's a request for a 3 percent increase in

 9   our rate in funding for our human services

10   programs over the next five years.   We

11   believe that this would go a long way towards

12   acknowledging a sector that has been ignored

13   in our state budget for far too long, and we

14   believe this would also go a long way toward

15   allowing us to recruit and retain the best

16   possible workforce for New York State human

17   services programs.

18           What is our New York State budget,

19   after all, if not a statement of New Yorkers'

20   values and priorities?   And human services

21   programs around the state are very important

22   for New Yorkers should they need to access

23   them.

24           Turning to the foster-care workforce
                                                      336

 1   now specifically, we have just updated our

 2   turnover and our salary information in a

 3   survey that we do of all of our agencies, and

 4   we know that our salaries remain far too low

 5   to be competitive.   We're competing with fast

 6   food establishments for our front-line staff,

 7   and we have a 41 percent turnover in our

 8   front-line childcare workers.   We have a

 9   38 percent turnover for our caseworkers

10   around the state.

11           This is unacceptable because, as was

12   brought up earlier, every time one of our

13   workers departs a program, it is the loss of

14   a relationship that a young person in foster

15   care has built with a caring adult that

16   they've come to rely on every day, that they

17   go to with their challenges and successes.

18   And we simply must do better on behalf of our

19   kids to stabilize our workforce.

20           And we will be coming around to all of

21   you for your help in driving an increase to

22   the foster-care rate, which is set,

23   post-budget, administratively between DOB and

24   OCFS.   Your partnership has been completely
                                                        337

 1   invaluable over the last couple of years in

 2   helping us to make sure that we have an

 3   increase in our main mechanism to provide

 4   salary increases to our foster-care staff.

 5            We're also asking for your help in

 6   growing two programs that are actually

 7   higher ed programs for our child welfare

 8   staff.    There is one that is focused on loan

 9   forgiveness for our child welfare workers and

10   another one focused on tuition support for

11   our child welfare staff.   Those programs are

12   in the Executive Budget at 50,000 each.       We

13   are appreciative of that, but we are asking

14   for $1 million for each one of those

15   programs.

16            HESC just made the first round of

17   these awards this past fall, and we

18   understand that there was just enough funding

19   to hand out four awards around the state.

20   And so while that's a handful of childcare

21   workers and childcare staff around the state

22   that are benefiting from those programs, we

23   know that the need is far greater, and we ask

24   for your help on that.
                                                    338

 1         We are going to be implementing the

 2   federal Family First Act this next fall in

 3   our child welfare field, and it's hard to

 4   understate how much change that's going to

 5   bring to our field.   There's also a lot of

 6   opportunity in it, and we are really excited

 7   about the opportunity to work together with

 8   OCFS and with our other partners in the

 9   counties on making sure that kids in foster

10   care are in family-based settings whenever

11   possible.

12         It's just that there is some very

13   ambitious Article VII language that has been

14   included on the independent assessor, and we

15   have some serious concerns that if this

16   particular part of the language, which has

17   the independent assessor ultimately making

18   the placement decision -- there are some

19   safety concerns that brings up.

20         What if the local district is actually

21   unable to find another placement within the

22   30 days, as is written in the ELFA language?

23   And we don't understand why this independent

24   assessor has been given so much power to, it
                                                     339

 1   seems, override the judgment of a judge and

 2   other local district commissioner who, at the

 3   end of the day, is ultimately responsible for

 4   the safety of the young people in his or her

 5   care.

 6           And also there have been no details

 7   established on this independent assessor role

 8   yet, which is a brand-new invention of the

 9   federal act.   And so we think that this is

10   really asking the Legislature to, you know,

11   sign off on this before we have all of the

12   details needed to understand the proposal in

13   full.   So we're asking for your help in just

14   making sure that that language makes sense

15   for the system that we need.

16           We know that we need to invest a lot

17   more in building the amount of foster homes

18   that we need and supporting our kinship

19   caregivers around the state, and the amount

20   of transition funding that's in the budget is

21   just simply not enough to do that yet, so

22   we're asking for your help with that as well.

23           Thank you for the opportunity to

24   testify.
                                                       340

 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 2         Assemblyman Ra.

 3         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:    Thank you.

 4         Good afternoon.    I just had a couple

 5   of questions.

 6         In terms of the share for special

 7   education placement, can you tell us about

 8   what the impact was when that shift was made

 9   in New York City?    Just, you know, in terms

10   of what we can expect it's going to have on

11   the system and the rest of the state if this

12   was to go through.

13         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:     Thank you for that

14   question.   Our understanding is that it

15   hasn't had too much of an impact on the

16   number of placements that were made from the

17   New York City School District when the shift

18   went through a couple of years ago at the

19   New York City level.

20         You know, ultimately it is up to the

21   school district to make the best decision on

22   behalf of the young people that they see

23   before them.    I think what's important to

24   point out is that, as Senator Krueger brought
                                                        341

 1   up before, this is something that was done to

 2   New York City a couple of years ago in the

 3   budget, and here we're hearing in this year

 4   that it is now parity, that it's going to be

 5   carried out statewide.

 6           And so, you know, the impact on the

 7   school districts -- it seems like it's about

 8   25 million that they're picking up this

 9   share, and we are trying to figure out some

10   data in terms of answering your question on

11   what kind of impact there was in New York

12   City.

13           ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   I mean, I'd assume

14   with any cost shift to a municipality,

15   obviously, you know, it has an impact on

16   their budgeting.   And outside of New York

17   City, with the tax cap and things of that

18   nature, it makes it that much more difficult.

19   And obviously you're dealing with independent

20   school districts that are much smaller as

21   well.

22           One other issue I wanted to ask you

23   about, the ELFA language and Family First.     I

24   think what I'm getting is that this really
                                                       342

 1   goes further than the federal government is

 2   really asking us to go; is that correct?

 3         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:    It does.   And just

 4   that one particular part of it which has the

 5   requirement that the local district would

 6   have to remove the young person out of the

 7   QRTP within 30 days -- that's not required by

 8   federal law.   So OCFS and the Executive

 9   Budget are going far and above that with this

10   proposal, yes.

11         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Thank you.

12         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:    Thank you.

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Senator Savino.

14         SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you, Senator

15   Krueger.

16         Good to see you again.

17         I just want to make this point,

18   because we've had this discussion before.

19   You heard me speak earlier today about my

20   concerns about the human service workforce.

21   But just in case people think I'm

22   exaggerating, the starting salary for a

23   caseworker in the nonprofit sector with a

24   bachelor's degree is $36,994.   The starting
                                                        343

 1   salary for an ACS worker in the City of

 2   New York with the same bachelor's degree is

 3   $49,279.   That number jumps to $53,519 if

 4   they complete six months of probation and

 5   they are moved up to the next level, Child

 6   Protective Specialist Level 2.     If you become

 7   a brand-new youth development specialist in

 8   the City of New York -- those are the workers

 9   who now service the Raise the Age program --

10   they walk in the door at $46,000.

11         So this gap between the nonprofit and

12   the public sector is growing further and

13   further apart every year.   And so I join you

14   in your support calling for the establishment

15   of a real fund to provide social work loan

16   forgiveness, because these agencies are not

17   going to be able to recruit anybody or retain

18   them, and it has -- as you know, it has a

19   terrible effect on young people.

20         And for those people who think these

21   kids don't know the difference, I have not

22   been a full-time caseworker since 1996.    I

23   still have young people who were on my

24   caseload who call me, oftentimes in crisis,
                                                        344

 1   because they don't forget the people who made

 2   a difference in their life.    And so when

 3   they're separated again or there's disruption

 4   again, it doubly traumatizes them.

 5         So I totally support the idea of

 6   expanding the current social work loan

 7   forgiveness program to the nonprofit sector,

 8   adding as much money as we can.    Thank you.

 9         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:      Thank you so much,

10   Senator, for your advocacy and for pointing

11   out the reality in terms of the huge

12   disparity between us and the public sector.

13         And the reality is that we simply

14   cannot compete, and that's what we're

15   finding.   And also we're often the training

16   ground, really, for the public sector,

17   because folks are with us for, you know,

18   maybe a few years, they're recent graduates,

19   and then they move on to the public sector.

20   There's more money, there's better benefits,

21   and who can blame them.

22         But as you point out, the importance

23   of that relationship that is built is

24   something that sustains over time.    And for
                                                         345

 1   our young people it's one more loss that

 2   they're experiencing after they've been

 3   through a lot.

 4            Thank you.

 5            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 6            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Assemblywoman

 7   Jaffee.

 8            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Thank you.

 9            There's no question you also recognize

10   the difficulty with childcare and

11   affordability in terms of asking the workers

12   as well --

13            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Is your mic on?

14            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Is it on now?

15            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Yes.

16            ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Okay.   I'm

17   sorry.

18            The issues of childcare workers and

19   the salaries, the limited salaries they earn,

20   and then with that, the affordability of

21   childcare, you mentioned that within this

22   context.    Do you see this continuing at this

23   time?    Is it something that we need to

24   address?    How soon can we move forward with
                                                         346

 1   that?

 2           MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:   Yes, and so for

 3   us, the parlance of childcare workers refers

 4   to our front-line staff working in our

 5   residential foster-care programs.    And so no

 6   question, you know, we have to do more to

 7   raise their pay.

 8           I think to your question about

 9   childcare more globally, my friends from the

10   Schuyler Center just spoke before me, and I

11   completely support everything that they said

12   about the need to invest more in childcare.

13   Because after all, if parents don't have a

14   safe childcare option, their children become

15   at-risk.   And so I applaud your efforts and

16   those of your colleagues and certainly my

17   colleagues at the Schuyler Center for

18   everything you're doing to make sure that

19   there's really an investment there.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:   We need to be

21   very vocal about that.   It's really something

22   essential for our youth and their future.      We

23   go into that in so many issues.

24           But there was something that you had
                                                       347

 1   discussed about the safety and living spaces

 2   for those in foster care.    Could you explain

 3   a little bit more about that?

 4         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:     Thank you for

 5   giving me time to do that.    I couldn't fit it

 6   into my five minutes.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:     I know, I just

 8   said that for --

 9         MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:     So we have had a

10   capital proposal the last couple of years.

11   We are asking for an investment from the

12   Legislature for our residential foster-care

13   campuses around the state and group homes and

14   things of that nature.

15         Our foster-care rate was held flat for

16   many years, and our agencies did not have the

17   resources from the state to be able to make

18   those capital investments -- it's things like

19   boilers, roofs, and it's also just making

20   safety investments.   We are, in our

21   residential programs, under the jurisdiction

22   of the Justice Center, and the Justice Center

23   often wants to see camera footage of events

24   that occurred, so it's investing in those
                                                          348

 1   cameras also.   So we'd like to see 15 million

 2   put forward for that.

 3           There's been a nonprofit

 4   infrastructure capital investment program

 5   made in the past.   In terms of a couple of

 6   years ago, there was about $120 million

 7   available for that.   We also certainly

 8   support larger efforts to put more money into

 9   that.   That would cover us as well.

10           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    We don't really

11   have the time, but the issue regarding the

12   foster-care youth in college -- I've had

13   several come to me and ask for assistance.

14   Once they are out of that foster-care system,

15   they really are left very much with the need

16   and with the inability to have the funding

17   for their college program.      So it's something

18   we do need to focus on.

19           MS. BRADY-STEPIEN:   Right.     We want to

20   go to that program this year.     Thank you.

21           ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Yes.   Thank

22   you.

23           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

24           Next we have Early Care & Learning
                                                       349

 1   Council, Meredith Chimento, followed by

 2   New York State Network For Youth Success,

 3   followed by New York State Kinship Navigator,

 4   Catholic Family Center.   Those folks should

 5   start to make their way down.   Thank you.

 6         MS. CHIMENTO:     Good afternoon.

 7         I think that one of the hot topics

 8   today is the availability of quality

 9   affordable childcare in New York State.    And

10   I'd like to speak specifically to the role

11   that the childcare resource and referral

12   agencies play in developing quality and

13   affordable childcare.

14         Ten years ago, the Early Care &

15   Learning Council and 35 CCR&R agencies were

16   awarded a continuation of a long-standing

17   contract to serve childcare providers,

18   parents, businesses, and their communities.

19   In 2012, those contracts received a cut.     It

20   has remained untouched since then, yet the

21   work of the CCR&Rs continue.

22         A CCR&R's role in the community is

23   multifaceted.   It helps parents locate

24   quality childcare, it helps businesses stay
                                                     350

 1   in the community by assisting employees and

 2   finding quality care for their children.

 3   CCR&Rs also provide a variety of training and

 4   intensive technical assistance to assist

 5   childcare providers in exceeding standards of

 6   quality, best practice, and meeting

 7   regulations.

 8         This year, as you all know, has been

 9   almost the perfect convergence of national

10   and local attention regarding the childcare

11   crisis, its exceedingly high cost, and the

12   underpaid wages that the predominantly

13   woman-based workforce earns.   At the same

14   time, the Child Care and Development Block

15   Grant afforded many CCR&Rs and my

16   organization, the Early Care & Learning

17   Council, an opportunity to expand its

18   services towards increasing the quality of

19   infant and toddler care in New York State.

20         Mental health consultants,

21   infant/toddler specialists have been hired

22   and trainings have been developed, all

23   working toward meeting children and the

24   individuals that care for them at a time in
                                                      351

 1   their lives when their neurons are firing,

 2   brain cells are developing, and the

 3   foundation for an exceptional education is

 4   being formed.

 5         Yet the workforce responsible for the

 6   development of these centers, of the family

 7   members and providers who care for our

 8   youngest and most vulnerable citizens, are

 9   vastly underpaid.   We are losing staff to

10   programs where the pay is higher, to state

11   jobs, and to different fields.   Over the past

12   three months, at least three long-term,

13   highly qualified, and valued CCR&R staff have

14   left due to insufficient pay.

15         Last year the CCR&Rs in New York State

16   fielded over 40,000 referral calls, delivered

17   37,000 hours of basic technical assistance,

18   and 19,000 hours of intensive technical

19   assistance which helps parents locate care,

20   helps providers increase their skills,

21   knowledge, and behavior.

22         What these figures don't show is the

23   challenges that each of the 35 CCR&Rs face.

24   With flat funding for 10 years, and the cut
                                                      352

 1   to the contracts in 2012, the staff at the

 2   CCR&Rs suffer.    Many have master's degrees,

 3   and many just earn just over minimum wage.

 4   The stress that these employees feel and the

 5   choices that CCR&Rs have to make are

 6   devastating.

 7         Next week, over 250 childcare

 8   advocates will come here to Albany to carry

 9   the ask of the Early Care & Learning Council,

10   Winning Beginning, Empire State Campaign --

11   which you'll hear more about from my fellow

12   advocates.   But many CCR&Rs will not be able

13   to attend.   They have lost grants, travel and

14   professional development budgets have been

15   cut, and one CCR&R even called us last night

16   so disappointed that they lost another grant,

17   that they aren't able to join their sisters

18   in the Capitol and rally to meet with each of

19   you to tell the successes of our field and

20   the challenges.

21         Sixty percent of New York State has

22   been classified as a childcare desert, which

23   means there's no care within reasonable

24   proximity to a person's home.   To address
                                                     353

 1   this issue, the Childcare Availability Task

 2   Force has been working diligently for the

 3   past year to make recommendations at the

 4   conclusion of 2020.    Regional Economic

 5   Development Councils have been tasked with

 6   making childcare a priority, and the

 7   aforementioned historic increase in the CCBG

 8   grant and its funding of infant/toddler

 9   services in New York State, have all laid a

10   foundation for quality care in New York

11   State.

12            However, CCR&Rs will only be able to

13   work with existing providers and new

14   providers by offering boot camps, fiscal

15   management, teaching them how to braid and

16   blend funding, connect to local businesses

17   and chambers to support their growth and

18   ensure their sustainability, if we receive

19   and realize a contract increase.    CCR&R

20   staffs have gone for many years without a

21   cost of living adjustment, without an

22   increase, without the ability to care for

23   their own.    Some CCR&R staff earn so little

24   that they qualify for childcare subsidies
                                                     354

 1   themselves.

 2         I ask each of you to consider the hard

 3   work and success potential of these CCR&Rs.

 4   We ask you to identify $5 million to account

 5   for a lack of COLA which will support the

 6   critical work of EC&LC and position ourselves

 7   at the ready to meet the needs of the

 8   recommendations of the Governor's task force

 9   and the Regional Economic Development

10   Councils.

11         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

12   Thank you for being here.

13         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    May I?

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Assemblywoman

15   Jaffee.

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Yes, I want to

17   thank you for your comments and your focus.

18         The childcare subsidies are truly

19   essential for our families so that they can

20   provide the opportunity for their child to be

21   in an environment, a very positive

22   environment where they are able to maintain

23   their work when they are at that very, very

24   limited of income.   It really is essential.
                                                        355

 1         And the after-school programs as well

 2   that you note are so important to ensure that

 3   our children are in an environment -- it's

 4   very positive.    It gives them emotional and

 5   social skills in a very positive way, and

 6   it's something that we need to continue to

 7   focus on.     And so I thank you for that

 8   suggestion, and perhaps we can discuss this

 9   as we move forward.

10         MS. CHIMENTO:     Absolutely.   Thank you

11   for your continued support, as always.

12         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

13   Thank you for being here.

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you for

15   being here.

16         MS. CHIMENTO:     Thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      As I said, next

18   we have New York State Network for Youth

19   Success.    I'm not sure if there's anybody

20   here from New York State Kinship Navigator; I

21   don't think anybody has signed in yet.      So

22   then we would have, following this, Services

23   and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and

24   Transgender Elders, SAGE, followed by
                                                     356

 1   New York State Association of Training and

 2   Employment Professionals.

 3         So we have Trudy Morgan, policy

 4   coordinator.   Please proceed.

 5         MS. MORGAN:   Good afternoon.     Thank

 6   you for allowing me to testify today.    My

 7   name is Trudy Morgan, and I'm the policy

 8   coordinator of the New York State Network for

 9   Youth Success.

10         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Could you pull

11   the mic a little bit closer to your mouth?

12         MS. MORGAN:   Is that better now?

13         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Yes.

14         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Okay.

15         MS. MORGAN:   So my name is Trudy

16   Morgan, and I'm the policy coordinator for

17   the New York State Network for Youth Success,

18   and I'm here to talk to you about

19   after-school, summer, and expanded learning

20   opportunities.

21         And before I invite you to look at

22   some of the research with me about the

23   crucial impact after-school has on New York

24   State's children, I would like to emphasize
                                                      357

 1   that I am a testament of why after-school

 2   matters.   I am where I am today in my role,

 3   following my passion, because I was able to

 4   participate in several after-school programs

 5   that broadened my perspectives as a new

 6   immigrant, equipped me with the necessary

 7   skills and resources to navigate my

 8   academics, and served as a catalyst for my

 9   robust interest in policy and advocacy.

10         Evidence shows that after-school

11   programs play a critical role in improving

12   student outcomes.   A recent study looked at a

13   broad range of after-school programs across

14   different age groups and focus areas -- such

15   as academics, athletics, and career

16   pathways -- and found significant positive

17   impacts on students.   These quality

18   after-school programs support our students to

19   pursue their passions and learn how to take

20   chances and make calculated risks and healthy

21   choices.

22         We also know that our after-school

23   programs do not only help working families

24   build bridges to their children's school day
                                                     358

 1   by offering academic and social supports, but

 2   they also help working families maintain

 3   their own economic stability at work while

 4   knowing their children are safe and engaged.

 5         We are pleased that the state has

 6   shown an interest in after-school by

 7   increasing investments through the Governor's

 8   Empire State After-School Program.   While we

 9   support additional investments in

10   after-school programs from the state, we must

11   ensure that existing funding streams that

12   support currently operating after-school

13   programs are adequately funded as well.

14         Therefore we urge the Legislature to

15   restore funding for the Advantage After

16   School Programs.   The Governor's budget

17   proposal of $28 million is a reduction from

18   last year's enacted budget of $33 million.

19   We thank the Legislature for restoring the

20   $5 million cut last year and ask you and urge

21   you to do so again.

22         At least 2,500 students currently

23   enrolled in Advantage programs will be at

24   risk of losing access to their programs if
                                                       359

 1   funding is not restored.   We also ask the

 2   Legislature to increase Advantage funding by

 3   $5.1 million to increase the per-pupil rate

 4   to $2,320.    This $2,320 would account for the

 5   minimum wage increase while holding all other

 6   factors related to after-school programs

 7   constant, including the number of children

 8   served.

 9         We also urge the state to restore

10   $1.5 million in funding for the Youth

11   Development Program that was cut from the

12   Executive Budget this year, and also maintain

13   the Governor's proposal to increase funding

14   for Summer Youth Employment by an additional

15   $1 million.

16         On childcare, we also ask the state to

17   invest $40 million to create a fund to

18   increase workforce compensation and improve

19   childcare quality, and another $60 million in

20   the state's childcare subsidy program to

21   expand access to more working families.

22         More than one-third of childcare

23   allows New York to support childcare for

24   school-aged children, including after-school

 1   and summer programs.   We also urge the state

 2   to reinstate $50,000 in Child Care and

 3   Development Block Grant funds to provide

 4   technical assistance to Advantage After

 5   School Program grantees and other school-age

 6   childcare programs around increasing program

 7   quality.

 8         These funds helped the network create

 9   and maintain the Quality Self-Assessment Tool

10   for more than 15 years, which is the quality

11   standards assessment tool created by experts

12   and practitioners in New York State and is

13   recommended for use by all state-funded

14   after-school programs, including the

15   Advantage After School Program, the Empire

16   State After School Program, and the extended

17   learning programs.

18         We also urge the state to invest an

19   additional $1.8 million towards the

20   Educational Incentive Program, for a total

21   funding of $7 million.   The Educational

22   Incentive Program provides scholarships to

23   assist childcare providers participating in

24   professional development activities with the
                                                     361

 1   intent to build provider knowledge, skills,

 2   and competencies to improve quality childcare

 3   in the state.

 4         Finally, we request that the state

 5   invest 25 percent of any revenue secured

 6   through the legalization of adult-use

 7   marijuana into after-school programs.      In

 8   Alaska, which allocated 12.5 percent of

 9   revenue from the legalization of recreational

10   marijuana to after-school, data shows that

11   youth who participated in programs just twice

12   a week were 40 percent less likely to use

13   marijuana.

14         I know that after-school works,

15   because I am the return on investment in

16   after-school.

17         In closing, I want you to know we are

18   part of Winning Beginning NY, and we support

19   the coalition's agenda.

20         Thank you for your time, and I am

21   happy to answer any questions.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

23         Assemblywoman Ellen Jaffee.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:    Yes, I want to
                                                       362

 1   thank you because you are speaking to the

 2   very real issues in terms of additional

 3   funding for childcare subsidies and so many

 4   of the other issues in youth employment and

 5   after-school programs.

 6         All of those issues that you bring to

 7   the table here are so essential for our

 8   youth, it really is an investment in their

 9   future.    And I thank you, and I -- it's

10   something that I stand with, and we know how

11   important it is.   So thank you very much.

12         MS. MORGAN:    Thank you very much,

13   Assemblymember Jaffee, for your continued

14   support.

15         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And Senator

16   Roxanne Persaud.

17         SENATOR PERSAUD:     Good afternoon.

18   Thank you very much for your advocacy.

19         I just have one question for you.      On

20   the Summer Youth Program, you indicate here

21   that the funding -- the additional $1 million

22   of funding will support the additional staff

23   and increase the number of youth that the

24   staff will serve by 750.   That's not what our
                                                          363

 1   analysis shows.

 2            MS. MORGAN:   Yes.   That's actually

 3   correct.    So this was a -- something we

 4   confirmed as of last night, that this would

 5   go toward the minimum wage increase while

 6   holding the number of students served in the

 7   Summer Youth Employment constant.

 8            SENATOR PERSAUD:     Okay.   So this -- I

 9   just wanted to clarify that this is not --

10            MS. MORGAN:   Yes.

11            SENATOR PERSAUD:     Thank you very much.

12            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Good for catching

13   the error.    Thank you.

14            Thank you very much for being here

15   today.

16            Our next testifier we believe is not

17   here, New York Kinship Navigator.        Anybody

18   want to argue differently?       Okay.

19            Then -- sorry -- Melissa Sklarz,

20   Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian,

21   Bisexual, Transgender Elders -- or, as we

22   call you, SAGE.

23            MS. SKLARZ:   Much simpler.

24            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And for people
                                                     364

 1   lining up, next is the New York Association

 2   of Training and Employment Professionals,

 3   followed by New York State Defenders

 4   Association Veterans Defense Program.

 5         Hi, Melissa.

 6         MS. SKLARZ:    Right.    Hi, Senator.

 7         Okay, so my name is Melissa Sklarz.

 8   I'm the SAGE senior government relations

 9   strategist.   Thank you to the members of the

10   Senate and Assembly for holding this hearing

11   today and allowing me the opportunity to

12   testify on behalf of SAGE.

13         SAGE is the country's first and

14   largest organization dedicated to improving

15   the lives of LGBT elders.     Founded in

16   New York City in 1978, SAGE provides services

17   and programs to LGBT older people throughout

18   our five SAGE Centers across the city, four

19   SAGE affiliates here in New York State --

20   including Bay Shore, Hudson Valley, Syracuse,

21   and Rochester -- and a network of affiliates

22   across the United States.

23         Because of thin support networks, LGBT

24   older people need to rely more heavily on
                                                        365

 1   community service providers for care as they

 2   age.     LGBT older people are more likely to

 3   face discrimination when accessing health

 4   care, social services, and other programs.

 5   For so many LGBT elders, it is their safety

 6   net.

 7            I wanted to speak briefly today about

 8   three programs here -- of course housing, but

 9   that will be next week -- but within our SAGE

10   housing, we have our SAGE Centers.     As you

11   may or may not know, this year we've opened

12   our first LGBT-friendly housing in Brooklyn,

13   called Stonewall House, in the Fort Green

14   area in Senator Montgomery's district.        We

15   had the ribbon-cutting last month.     It's

16   145 units.    Twenty-five percent are formerly

17   homeless elders, 77 percent are people of

18   color.    And that will mesh well with the

19   neighborhood.     We -- it was split between

20   LGBT people and people from NYCHA.

21            And this year, coming in April, we

22   will be following up with a second house in

23   Crotona North, in the Bronx, which will have

24   83 units.
                                                     366

 1         Both of these will have SAGE Centers,

 2   as the first LGBT-friendly housing in

 3   New York State.   The Sage Center in

 4   Corona Park will be the largest SAGE Center

 5   in the state, over 10,000 feet, and the one

 6   in Brooklyn will have 8500 feet.

 7         And so many of the elders who attend

 8   our SAGE Centers daily struggle with mental

 9   illness, substance abuse, and homelessness,

10   requiring an intensive amount of care

11   management and social service support.    So

12   with these houses open and to be open, we

13   expect higher levels of needs among the

14   residents and elders in the surrounding

15   communities.   Our SAGE Centers are open not

16   only to the residents but the elder residents

17   that are in the neighborhoods here, and so we

18   expect to see a great influx.   No one's ever

19   complained there's too much social service

20   for elders in New York.

21         So we will be requiring additional

22   investment in our care management and SAGE

23   Center program to meet these needs.    SAGE

24   requests $100,000 in support from New York
                                                     367

 1   State to provide comprehensive care

 2   management.   SAGE Center programming support

 3   services alone cover predominantly LGBT elder

 4   residents in and around the -- our welcoming

 5   elder housing developments.

 6           SAGE also requests a restoration of

 7   $200,000 in support of our general services

 8   and expenses in support of our state LGBT

 9   elders.   In total, we request a restoration

10   of $300,000 in fiscal year 2021.

11           Finally, as our veteran program -- we

12   heard today Colonel McDonough and

13   Assemblymember Barrett talked about SAGE

14   vets.   We are growing, we are expanding, we

15   are -- most of our LGBT vets do not live in

16   New York City but live throughout the state.

17           Our manager of SAGE Vets has been

18   traveling from Long Island up to the

19   Adirondacks, through the Southern Tier, to

20   let veterans know that their discharges can

21   be updated and approved, that care management

22   is available, that legal services -- and the

23   more that we can connect people to the

24   federal system will make it easier on
                                                      368

 1   New York State to have to worry less about

 2   the problems of homelessness and suicide if

 3   we can access them to the federal system.

 4         So in this fiscal year, SAGE

 5   respectfully requests an increase in funding,

 6   requesting $150,000 to continue the outreach

 7   and benefits connecting to LGBT elder

 8   veterans.    The increased support will expand

 9   the SAGE Vet program and access LGBT elder

10   veterans throughout the state through a

11   re-grant to our SAGE affiliates at Out

12   Alliance in Rochester and in SAGE Upstate in

13   Syracuse.

14         So thanks for the chance to do this

15   today, and I'll be happy to answer any

16   questions.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

18         Anybody?    Then thank you very much for

19   being with us.

20         ASSEMBLYWOMAN JAFFEE:       Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

22         MS. SKLARZ:    Thank you.

23         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next we have

24   New York Association of Training and
                                                       369

 1   Employment Professionals, Melinda Mack,

 2   executive director, followed by the New York

 3   State Defenders Association Veterans Defense

 4   Program.

 5         MS. MACK:    Hi, how are you.   I usually

 6   think my organization's a mouthful, so I'm

 7   glad that there's others that are also tough.

 8         Hi, everyone, and good afternoon.     My

 9   name is Melinda Mack.   I'm the executive

10   director of the New York Association of

11   Training and Employment Professionals, which

12   is known as New York State's workforce

13   development association.

14         I'm also not going to read through my

15   testimony, but I want to spend a few minutes

16   highlighting a few things that I think we've

17   touched on a bit but haven't addressed yet in

18   today's hearing.

19         So as you know, I represent members

20   who provide workforce development services,

21   which are also part of the human services

22   field, across New York State and all 62

23   counties.   They range from really small

24   organizations like community-based
                                                     370

 1   organizations to huge institutions like SUNY

 2   and CUNY.

 3         I think one of the things I want to

 4   underscore is, as you know, many of the folks

 5   that our members serve are those who need

 6   jobs not only the most, but also will lift

 7   folks out of poverty based on their outcomes

 8   and employment.   As you also know, around

 9   42 percent of New Yorkers have a high school

10   equivalency or less.   And so as we continue

11   to think about human services investment, we

12   really should be focusing our efforts in

13   education, job training and employment

14   services for the many New Yorkers who need

15   support and skills training to be able to

16   access good or better jobs.

17         I also want to just mention that, you

18   know, we've worked with United Way over the

19   last couple of years to highlight those who

20   are working poor.   We do know in our state

21   about a quarter-million New Yorkers are stuck

22   in part-time or low-wage work.   These are

23   folks who are working.   These are people who

24   have jobs, who are struggling to still make
                                                       371

 1   ends meet.   And about 45 percent of

 2   New Yorkers fit into that ALICE criteria as

 3   described by United Way.

 4         For about 20 years now, New York's

 5   strategy to solve the workforce development

 6   crisis that we're facing -- and we have about

 7   50,000 jobs right now that are open and in

 8   demand that we cannot fill -- has been flat

 9   funding, cuts, or tax credits.     When we look

10   across the budget this year, the Executive

11   Budget, we're about $40 million short of the

12   enacted budget last year.

13         However, there are some bright spots.

14   We heard Summer Youth Employment mentioned

15   here -- again, to offset the increase in

16   minimum wage.   There's also two new

17   initiatives, one supporting environmental

18   justice training across the state and then

19   also diversity in entertainment.

20         I do want to spend a minute touching

21   on the Governor's investment last year of

22   $175 million in workforce development, which

23   is managed through the new Office of

24   Workforce Development.   Again, for those
                                                       372

 1   who've seen me testify before, this was a

 2   huge win for the workforce system statewide,

 3   to think that there would now be dedicated

 4   resources going to education, job training,

 5   and employment to start to, you know,

 6   address, a little bit here and there, what

 7   we're seeing across the state in terms of

 8   service delivery needs.

 9         At this point about $3.4 million in

10   funding has been awarded, and the Governor

11   has recommitted to investing in those dollars

12   for the upcoming years.   I do, however, want

13   to draw your attention to the fact that the

14   flexible dollars in that fund are coming out

15   of the Pay for Success contingency fund,

16   which continue to remain relatively

17   unflexible, or inflexible.

18         We are sort of at the discretion of

19   the Division of Budget in terms of what

20   constraints they put on those resources.    For

21   the human services sector -- again, of which

22   many provide these economic development and

23   workforce services -- they're required to

24   have all of the money up-front in order to be
                                                      373

 1   able to deliver the services, and then

 2   they're reimbursed by the state based on

 3   their outcomes.   It's just not tenable, it's

 4   not reasonable, and it's not the way that we

 5   know to do effective best practices in

 6   workforce development.

 7         Additionally, we've prescribed

 8   performance for an outcome of employment

 9   after one year.   If you're working with those

10   with low basic skills, if you're supporting

11   individuals with disabilities, if you're

12   working with some of our hardest-to-serve

13   populations or even trying to put someone

14   through an apprenticeship program, one year

15   is not enough time in order to be able to

16   help someone access a good or better job.

17         The last thing I wanted to mention

18   before I also touch on childcare is that we

19   still also struggle across the state in being

20   able to measure the performance of our

21   systems.   I'm sure many of the other human

22   service organizations or folks who represent

23   human services would say our members have to

24   enter data into anywhere between 10 and 12
                                                      374

 1   data systems across New York State.    It is a

 2   huge time-suck.

 3         It also does not allow us to

 4   effectively describe or showcase what we're

 5   able to do.    So we often hear from you all,

 6   "So tell us how many people you placed into

 7   employment across the state, across your many

 8   programs."    I can't.   I can't do it in a

 9   meaningful way.

10         And so we also ask and encourage you

11   to continue to focus on -- I know

12   Assemblymember Bronson has talked about this

13   for years -- a way to better articulate and

14   communicate the success of the workforce

15   system and our investments in education, job

16   training, and employment.

17         The last thing I wanted to mention is

18   that childcare is a huge issue.    Everywhere

19   we go across the state and we talk to

20   employers, people are missing work, they're

21   having to call in, they cannot find access to

22   affordable, reasonable childcare.    This will

23   continue to be a major impact on our economic

24   development investment.     You can deliver
                                                      375

 1   jobs, you can have job numbers, as many as

 2   you like, but if you cannot find affordable

 3   childcare for people to be able to actually

 4   take those jobs, we're going to continue to

 5   struggle.

 6         Thank you.    I'm happy to answer any of

 7   your questions.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Assemblyman

10   Bronson.

11         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Thank you.    I

12   just want to follow up on the $175 million.

13         MS. MACK:    Sure.

14         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     What was the

15   dollar amount that you said has already been

16   disbursed or authorized?

17         MS. MACK:    Sure.   So we've seen a

18   press release two weeks ago, $3.4 million in

19   funding.

20         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Okay.   And are

21   you aware of applications that have been

22   submitted and pending, and what that dollar

23   amount translates into?

24         MS. MACK:    No, so I don't know the
                                                      376

 1   number.

 2         But I do know that there's been a

 3   number -- so the way that the Governor's

 4   office is structured, the application

 5   process, there's a phase one that goes

 6   through a subcommittee of the Regional

 7   Economic Development Council where they sort

 8   of bless it, they say it aligns with the

 9   original strategy.

10         If that makes it through that

11   gauntlet, it then goes up to the Office of

12   Workforce Development in the Division of

13   Budget, in which they negotiate and decide

14   whether or not it meets the criteria for the

15   funding stream.   It then goes through a

16   second phase of application where then they

17   sort of go into contracting and end up

18   supporting -- or moving forward.

19         So I do know there's a number that's

20   sort of in that middle ground, but we

21   certainly aren't spending money anywhere near

22   fast enough.

23         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:   Right.   And this

24   is actually the second year that there was
                                                       377

 1   174 million, but nothing happened the first

 2   year, correct?

 3         MS. MACK:     Correct.

 4         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     All right.   And

 5   are you aware of or can you issue some kind

 6   of idea on what's happening in connection

 7   with these $175 million that are available,

 8   and how we're addressing the home care

 9   workforce?

10         MS. MACK:     Yeah, so there is not a

11   direct connection in terms of how it's dated.

12   Again, I think we see across all caregiving

13   occupations a consistent challenge around

14   wages and the ability to recruit based on

15   wages and educational requirements.   So

16   whether you're a direct support professional,

17   home health aide, or childcare worker, we're

18   seeing very similar challenges in the

19   workforce field.

20         Of course, the 175 can certainly be

21   used for education, training, and placement

22   of those workers.    It cannot be paid to

23   replace wages.   And so that's one of the

24   struggles we're seeing.
                                                       378

 1         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     All right.   And

 2   so it's been identified in home care workers

 3   some of the struggles, some of the

 4   barriers -- childcare being one of them,

 5   transportation being another, the fact that

 6   they get paid such low wages they can't even

 7   pay for their car maintenance, yet that's an

 8   essential part of their job because they have

 9   to travel from site to site.

10         Your understanding of the parameters

11   of these funds, could that offset any of

12   those costs, and possibly a pilot program or

13   something else as we're looking at developing

14   that workforce?

15         MS. MACK:   Yeah, we're hopeful that

16   the Division of Budget sees those as

17   opportunities for innovation, right?

18         There's also something called the

19   Employer Resource Network that happens across

20   many regions where it's a coordination of

21   community-based services and human services

22   to support low-wage workers.

23         Right now, the way that it stands, it

24   needs to end in employment.    So any of those
                                                       379

 1   retention supports that are necessary to get

 2   low-wage workers the skills and, more

 3   importantly, the work experience necessary to

 4   move up -- right now it doesn't look like

 5   those can be invested in unless there's an

 6   employment outcome.

 7         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     Okay.   And just

 8   a quick shout out to the Empire State

 9   Apprenticeship Tax Credit Program.

10         MS. MACK:   Yeah.

11         ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON:     So we need to

12   make sure that gets renewed in this budget.

13   Thank you.

14         MS. MACK:   Thank you.

15         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

16         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next we have

18   NYSDA, New York State Defenders Association,

19   Veterans Defense Program, Lieutenant Colonel

20   Roy Diehl, to be followed by the New York

21   State Veterans Council, to be followed by

22   Prevent Child Abuse New York.

23         LT. COL. DIEHL:     Thank you.   I see

24   you're enjoying acronyms, which is, for
                                                       380

 1   anyone in uniform, something that you both

 2   live by all the time, trip over, and use to

 3   abuse your friends and family.

 4         So my name is Roy Diehl.     I'm here as

 5   the deputy director of the Veterans Defense

 6   Program, a statewide program of the New York

 7   Defenders Association.

 8         So I'm also one of the 718,000

 9   veterans who call New York home.     I enlisted

10   in the U.S. Army in 1984 at the height of the

11   Cold War and served in West Germany at the

12   Iron Curtain, I graduated from Albany Law

13   School in '92 and was commissioned    as a

14   judge advocate in the New York Army National

15   Guard in '98.   I served with so many of my

16   fellow New Yorkers in the 42nd Infantry

17   Division in Lower Manhattan after 9/11 and in

18   Iraq when we deployed there in 2005.    I

19   retired from the Army Reserve as a lieutenant

20   colonel in 2015, and I'm now very proud to

21   serve with the New York State community

22   serving our New York State veterans through

23   the Veterans Defense Program.

24         So the VDP, a three-letter acronym for
                                                      381

 1   the Veterans Defense Program, provides

 2   training, support, and legal assistance to

 3   promote trauma-informed effective

 4   representation of veterans in criminal and

 5   family courts.   I ask for your support for a

 6   legislative add to the budget -- legislative

 7   adds, a total of $720,000.

 8          So state funding has allowed us to

 9   help justice-involved wounded warriors

10   suffering from mental health conditions to

11   receive treatment and probation and avoid

12   incarceration with a cost savings of up to

13   $77 million over the past four years.    This

14   year we request a $500,000 renewal matched

15   evenly by the Assembly and the Senate for a

16   statewide program and a $220,000 renewal by

17   the Senate for a Long Island office where the

18   highest concentration of our veterans are

19   located.

20          So in brief, that's what I have to

21   say.   You have a lot of good things about the

22   way we do our program in the written

23   materials that go with the testimony.

24          So I'm subject to your questions.
                                                        382

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    No?

 2           Thank you --

 3           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     -- and we have

 5   the remainder of your submitted testimony.

 6           Oh, I'm sorry.

 7           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Senator Savino.

 8           SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you.   Thank

 9   you.

10           I just have one question for you,

11   because on the back page of your presentation

12   you have a graph that shows, of the 718,000

13   veterans in New York State, an estimated

14   30 percent, or 215,670, have PTSD, TBI, or

15   depression.

16           So I just wanted -- as I mentioned to

17   the director of Veterans' Services, when we

18   added PTSD as a qualified condition, it was

19   largely driven by veterans.     Do you have any

20   indication of the number of vets who are

21   suffering -- are trying to avail themselves

22   of the Compassionate Care Act?     Are they

23   running into obstacles, are you hearing from

24   them?
                                                          383

 1           LT. COL. DIEHL:   This is part of the

 2   joy of being a veteran.     We internalize so

 3   much.   We self-medicate, we self-treat,

 4   because we were taught to be self-reliant.

 5   If you've got a problem, you just need to

 6   overcome.

 7           So how many people have issues that

 8   they're dealing with that have not manifested

 9   at this time?   This is the best guess from

10   the professionals who study these things.       We

11   know when people commit suicide, they went

12   really, really deep.   We know when they have

13   gotten themselves arrested because of drug or

14   substance abuse issues or some kind of

15   violence, acting out, we know they're

16   manifesting these things.

17           But there are other people who can be

18   going along for years and years and you don't

19   notice until all of a sudden something snaps.

20           So you just never know.    It's not like

21   we're all, you know, Rambos out there waiting

22   to blow up in people's faces.     But the

23   ability to get in and reach out and touch

24   people, to say, Hey, we got your back, come
                                                      384

 1   on in, you know, we can help, you could use

 2   some help -- that's part of this whole thing

 3   in the Dwyer Program, as I understand it --

 4         SENATOR SAVINO:   Right.

 5         LT. COL. DIEHL:   -- with the mentors,

 6   to reach out and just drag people in so that

 7   they don't feel alone, they're not isolated,

 8   and they can get the help that is out there

 9   for them.

10         Again, with our program, we're only

11   getting them when they get into the court

12   system one way or another.    When, you know,

13   we need to make sure the government is not

14   adding to the abuse and the pain.    You know,

15   so that's where I feel really good in helping

16   my clients.

17         SENATOR SAVINO:   Thank you.

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

19   being here.

20         LT. COL. DIEHL:   Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Next we have

23   New York State Veterans Council, Kirby Hannan

24   and Bob Becker, followed by Prevent Child
                                                       385

 1   Abuse New York, followed by Coalition for the

 2   Homeless.

 3           MR. HANNAN:   Bob actually wound up

 4   with a VA appointment, so he bequeathed the

 5   testimony to me.   And I just want to say that

 6   you folks have given a whole new definition

 7   to "hard-ass."

 8           (Laughter.)

 9           MR. HANNAN:   I thought I knew what it

10   meant in the military.   My hats are off to

11   you, thanks for your dedication, thanks for

12   listening.   Everybody here feels the same

13   way.

14           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

15           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

16           MR. HANNAN:   Quickly, I'm going to run

17   through things that I think work together,

18   and I'm hoping that you guys can understand

19   that.   And so here goes.

20           Veteran Service Officer funding --

21   there's a couple of kinds.      One's at the

22   county level, and one's employed by a

23   congressionally recognized organization such

24   as mine, the VFW, or the American Legion.
                                                          386

 1   All right?    Having said that, you're funding

 2   the VFW, for example, to the tune of -- they

 3   have three VSOs -- to the tune of about

 4   $125,000.    Total, not each.    Total.   All

 5   right?    For that, you get back about

 6   $1.5 million a month in federal benefits in

 7   claims going to New York veterans.        So we're

 8   getting our money's worth out of that.

 9            And by the way, the county Veteran

10   Service Officers are doing the same thing.

11   They're -- the investment that we make, it's

12   about $30 for every dollar that we put out

13   there.    And the counties don't get much at

14   all, by the way, and it should really be

15   looked at again.      Because typically they'll

16   get about $10,000 for every 100,000 vets that

17   they serve, and then there's a formula that

18   goes up from there.

19            All right.    So having said that, you

20   know, we don't need to have more money there

21   necessarily.    If it happens, good.      All

22   right?    What we really need to do is to have

23   them, the Veteran Service Officers, way more

24   engaged in the Dwyer Program in terms of
                                                         387

 1   accountability.

 2           You're funding the Dwyer Program to

 3   the tune of 3.5 million.   We're always

 4   concerned about how OMH handles it.      I want

 5   you folks to take a peek at two bills.        One

 6   is the Veteran-to-Veteran Peer Certification

 7   Program -- it's one bill, excuse me.      It's

 8   Ortiz/Parker.   And then down below, with the

 9   Women Vet Peer-to-Peer programs.      Again,

10   Ortiz/Parker, it's in the same bill.     We

11   thought we could split it out, but it didn't

12   work.

13           But the bottom line is, the

14   accreditation -- I could take an

15   accreditation course through OMH right now.

16   Or I could audit it, have them recognize me,

17   I could learn more about peer-to-peer

18   techniques as a VSO, and I could manage the

19   program better as OMH distributes the funds.

20   All right?   And that -- I don't need to paint

21   a different picture from that.   And OMH could

22   recognize me for having audited it.      It

23   doesn't have to be a requirement.     It could

24   be, for getting the funds, for that matter.
                                                         388

 1            All right, moving to women veterans,

 2   because we are concerned about that -- and I

 3   heard that numerous times today.     All right?

 4   The Women Veteran Peer-to-Peer is kind of

 5   left out.    The men -- Dwyer's an AA program,

 6   all right?    It's an AA program, it's an

 7   anonymous program at the post level for

 8   veterans to help other veterans.     You just

 9   heard from Roy Diehl, he said the same thing.

10   All right?    It's ongoing at the grassroots

11   level.

12            Having said that, if women are --

13   don't go to the post as much.   I'm going to

14   say men go to the post, women not so much.

15   All right?    So having said that, Marlene

16   Roll, an ex-past commander of the VFW, about

17   once a year calls the women together in

18   Erie County.    She gets 200 women every time

19   she sends the invite out.   So this is what

20   we're talking about regarding that

21   Ortiz/Parker bill.

22            No brick and mortar, no money.   Again,

23   the accreditation program, no money.      We just

24   want to up the culture in terms of
                                                       389

 1   understanding of how Dwyer can work.    And I

 2   heard more about Dwyer today than I have in

 3   the last five years that we've been

 4   testifying, and I just want to say thank you,

 5   because you've been listening.

 6         Veterans Treatment Court benefits from

 7   this because they get a monitor and a mentor

 8   that knows what they're doing, and then if

 9   they can get into additional training from

10   OCA, they'll know how that fits into the

11   court structure and then we've got an

12   alternative sentencing program that can

13   really work.   You've heard from Roy Diehl,

14   Veterans Defense Program, I don't need to

15   kill that.

16         So there we are.     Thanks.   I don't

17   blame you, you're not going to insult me if

18   you don't have any questions.    Don't worry

19   about a thing, I get it.

20         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Kirby, you were

21   very succinct and effective.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

23         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you for

24   being here.
                                                           390

 1         MR. HANNAN:   Okay.   All right, thanks.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Next, Prevent

 3   Child Abuse New York, followed by Coalition

 4   for the Homeless, followed by Empire Justice

 5   Center.

 6         MR. HATHAWAY:   Good afternoon.      You

 7   have my testimony in front of you.   My name

 8   is Tim Hathaway, I'm the executive director

 9   with Prevent Child Abuse New York.   I'm not

10   going to read through this entire

11   presentation but instead pick out a couple of

12   important points.

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Bring the mic a

14   little closer.

15         MR. HATHAWAY:   Absolutely.

16         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

17         MR. HATHAWAY:   Prevent Child Abuse is

18   a statewide organization, not-for-profit.        We

19   have projects going on in Niagara Falls all

20   the way down to the tippy toes of

21   Long Island.   So we're doing a lot of

22   different work.

23         What I want to call your attention to

24   are a number of projects.   Some of them have
                                                       391

 1   been mentioned today already.    We believe

 2   primarily that child abuse prevention is a

 3   community-based activity.    It's about putting

 4   the right sort of resources in communities

 5   and ensuring that those are working well on

 6   behalf of children and families.

 7         Right now it's estimated that the

 8   average cost of one child abuse case is about

 9   $210,000.   So if we have to march through the

10   68,000 cases that happen annually in New York

11   State, we're talking about a lot of dollars.

12   It's much easier to prevent those child abuse

13   cases, and we know that there are programs at

14   work today in the state that do that

15   prevention work for us.    And I'm going to

16   talk about five of those programs.   These are

17   all evidence-based programs.    We know they

18   work because the science tells us they work.

19         The first one is maternal/infant/early

20   childhood home visiting.    We've heard a

21   little bit of discussion about this today.

22   Our budget ask around this is $2 million for

23   the Parent-Child Home Program, $1 million for

24   Healthy Families New York, and $4 million for
                                                         392

 1   Nurse-Family Partnership.

 2         I will note that the cut to the

 3   private-public partnership is going to hit in

 4   particular the Parent-Child Home Program.      So

 5   this will eat at their funding that's already

 6   in place.    We're going the wrong direction if

 7   we don't do something about that cut to the

 8   public-private partnership.

 9         We also want to spend a minute on

10   Family Resource Centers.    Family Resource

11   Centers are places in communities where

12   parents can go to find a supportive voice, to

13   find information about child development and

14   about other community resources.    They can

15   find many times the sort of resources that

16   help strengthen their family in ways that we

17   know prevent child abuse.

18         The evidence around this program says

19   that in neighborhoods where Family Resource

20   Centers are placed, the rate of child abuse

21   goes down.   Simple, simple prevention.

22         We're asking, based on what we've

23   found, discovered in our work -- we're asking

24   for a $200,000 request to place two
                                                       393

 1   additional Family Resource Centers, one in

 2   the Mohawk Valley where there is not one

 3   currently, and then also in another location

 4   to be determined.

 5            Housing.   We've heard a little bit

 6   about housing today.    Housing is child abuse

 7   prevention.    We know when families have

 8   stable housing, it reduces the amount of

 9   child abuse.    Assembly Bill 1620 and Senate

10   2375 would build out our current affordable

11   housing availability in the state.

12            Childcare we have talked about many,

13   many times today.    I'm not going to spend a

14   lot of time there, but what we know is that

15   when childcare facilities, when providers are

16   in place, it protects children and builds

17   strong families.

18            The final one there is after-school.

19   Again, we've heard a lot about after-school

20   today.    Again, if kids can be in a spot where

21   there are caring adults when their parents

22   are not available, we know that protects

23   children.    It supports families.   It's

24   important for us to build out that funding
                                                       394

 1   and replace that budget cut of $5 million

 2   that's been proposed.

 3         Also attached to my testimony in the

 4   last seconds here is the childcare budget

 5   request from Winning Beginning and Empire

 6   State Campaign for Childcare.    Prevent Child

 8   organizations.

 9         Thank you.

10         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you for

11   being here today.

12         MR. HATHAWAY:     Yes.

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next, Coalition

15   for the Homeless, followed by Empire Justice

16   Center, followed by New York Association for

17   the Education of Young Children.

18         MS. NORTZ:     Good afternoon.   My name

19   is Shelly Nortz.    I'm the deputy executive

20   director for policy with the Coalition for

21   the Homeless.

22         Senator Krueger, Assemblymember

23   Weinstein, thank you for your endurance.

24   Other members, I appreciate your being here
                                                     395

 1   and your willingness to listen.

 2           I'm going to just hit the high points

 3   of my testimony.   Can you hear me?    Yes?

 4   Good.

 5           Last year saw homelessness rise again

 6   to record levels in New York State, evidence

 7   of a continuing and unchecked affordable

 8   housing crisis as well as the most extreme

 9   income inequality found anywhere in our

10   nation.   Shockingly, nearly 253,000

11   New Yorkers were homeless in the 2018-2019

12   school year, staying in shelters or doubled

13   up with friends and family, a number

14   exceeding the population of every city in the

15   state with the exception of New York City.

16   This consists of 133,000 unduplicated

17   children and adults sleeping in New York City

18   shelters, 79,000 homeless students in

19   New York City not sleeping in shelters,

20   including those doubled up, 34,000 homeless

21   students outside New York City, including

22   those doubled up, and 5,944 homeless adults

23   sleeping in shelters outside New York City.

24           As we know, thousands more sleep on
                                                     396

 1   the streets every night on steam grates,

 2   cardboard boxes, and in the transit system.

 3   New York City, where 85 percent of the

 4   state's undomiciled population lives, remains

 5   the epicenter of the worst homelessness

 6   crisis since the Great Depression.   The

 7   number of children and adults sleeping in

 8   shelters each night was 63,000 in November

 9   2019, including more than 22,000 children and

10   an all-time-record 18,681 single adults.

11         The New York City shelter census rose

12   sharply in the first several years of

13   Governor Cuomo's tenure in the executive

14   chamber and remains at unsustainably high

15   levels, due in large part to the withdrawal

16   of state resources for a housing subsidy

17   program that was never replaced, and a

18   years-long delay in funding and initiating a

19   new state supportive housing program.

20   Thousands more adults have entered New York

21   City shelters directly from state prisons, as

22   we heard earlier, thanks to inadequate

23   discharge planning and a lack of sufficient

24   reentry housing options for people trying to
                                                       397

 1   get back on their feet.

 2            Indeed, the number of people staying

 3   in New York City shelters each night rose by

 4   60 percent between January of 2011 and

 5   November of 2019, an increase of more than

 6   23,000 children and adults.

 7            There are far more single individuals

 8   seeking shelter in New York City today than

 9   during the terms of any other governor since

10   modern mass homelessness began, as you can

11   see from the table.    The reasons for this are

12   clear.    Governor Cuomo not only eliminated

13   state funds for a mediocre rent subsidy

14   program without replacing it with a better

15   one, but he also dragged out the process of

16   starting a new state supportive housing

17   program for years and has released increasing

18   numbers of people from state prisons directly

19   to New York City shelters.

20            The number who moved into supportive

21   housing units in fiscal year 2018 reached a

22   14-year low even as the number of single

23   adults sleeping in shelters reached an all

24   time high.    Fewer than 1,450 adults were
                                                      398

 1   placed in supportive housing in 2018, or just

 2   3.5 percent of all individuals who spent time

 3   in shelters that year, down from 7 percent a

 4   decade prior.

 5         Further, New York State prisons

 6   released directly to New York City

 7   shelters contributed to record homelessness

 8   for single adults, representing over half of

 9   all New York City releases and 15 percent of

10   all institutional releases directly to

11   New York City shelters.

12         We have two imperatives for 2020:

13   Home Stability Support, as we've talked about

14   earlier today, and additional capital funds

15   to spur supportive housing development.

16   Thank you, Senator Krueger, for asking the

17   commissioner those questions.

18         First and foremost, the time has come

19   to enact Home Stability Support legislation

20   introduced by Senator Krueger and

21   Assemblymember Hevesi and cosponsored by 35

22   Senators and 125 members of the Assembly.    A

23   2016 analysis used to help design HSS found

24   that two-thirds of the 171,000 households
                                                     399

 1   receiving public assistance shelter

 2   allowances have rents that exceed their

 3   allowances, placing them at risk of

 4   homelessness.   Of those, more than 80,000

 5   households were then on the brink of

 6   homelessness.   Surely their number has grown

 7   and their circumstances have become more

 8   acute since.

 9         I'm going to skip to the next section

10   of my recommendations because I'm running low

11   on time.   And let me just say that we are

12   pleased that Governor Cuomo provided

13   additional funds for more supportive housing

14   in his Executive Budget proposal, but

15   honestly it is far too little, too late for

16   the dire circumstance that we see on the

17   ground.    And so we ask that the Legislature

18   fund the 14,000 remaining units in this

19   year's budget and enact Home Stability

20   Support without delay, notwithstanding the

21   fact that there's a pilot program out there.

22         Thank you.

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you for

24   your years of hard work and for coming before
                                                         400

 1   us.

 2            MS. NORTZ:    Thank you so much.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 4            Next, Empire Justice Center, Saima

 5   Akhtar, followed by New York Association for

 6   the Education of Young Children, followed by

 7   New York State Community Mobilization Housing

 8   Works.

 9            MS. AKHTAR:   Is this about right?    Or

10   do you need it a little closer?      Good, okay.

11            Good afternoon to the members of the

12   committee.    Thank you for sticking it out

13   today.    My name is Saima Akhtar.    I am a

14   senior attorney at Empire Justice Center.      I

15   truly appreciate the opportunity to submit

16   testimony today.

17            I'll be giving some comments on a few

18   selected portions of our written testimony,

19   just of highlights and leaving the rest as a

20   surprise for later.

21            Empire Justice Center, as many of you

22   already know, is a statewide legal services

23   organization with offices in Albany,

24   Rochester, two in Westchester and Central
                                                       401

 1   Islip on Long Island.   The organization

 2   provides support and training to legal

 3   services and other community-based

 4   organizations, undertakes policy research and

 5   analysis, and engages in legislative and

 6   administrative advocacy.

 7         We also represent low-income

 8   individuals as well as classes of New Yorkers

 9   in a wide range of areas that include civil

10   rights, health, public assistance, domestic

11   violence, and SSI and D disability benefits.

12         As the members of the committee are

13   certainly well aware, the New York State

14   economy has actually been relatively robust

15   in the past year and, in spite of a looming

16   and somewhat self-inflicted budget deficit,

17   the Legislature still has the opportunity and

18   the capacity to take action on behalf of

19   those who are most in need.   We can solidify

20   the safety-net programs and provide some real

21   progressive change here in New York.

22         One of the things that I want to

23   highlight for you today is the Disability

24   Advocacy Program, also known as DAP.     DAP is
                                                      402

 1   a long-standing program here in New York,

 2   it's existed since the early 1980s, and what

 3   DAP does is it funds advocates in every

 4   county in the state who assist folks who have

 5   been cut off or denied federal SSI or D

 6   benefits to secure those benefits and draw

 7   down federal funds into New York.   This saves

 8   the state money.   It's about a $2-plus return

 9   on the investment for every one dollar that

10   funds DAP.

11         What we are seeing is that in 2019,

12   applicants for disability benefits began to

13   face additional -- what's called a mandatory

14   reconsideration before an actual hearing is

15   held on a denied application.   This process,

16   this desk review process places an additional

17   hurdle along the path of folks with

18   disabilities being able to actually get their

19   application reviewed.   It puts them one step

20   further away from securing benefits and

21   receiving payments, it keeps clients poorer

22   longer, it costs the state money, and it is

23   an unnecessary delay that was essentially

24   created by federal regulatory change.
                                                      403

 1           The DAP advocates have willingly taken

 2   on this step and have not actually sought

 3   extra funding to do it.    What we are seeking

 4   at this time is essentially a repeated

 5   investment, the same -- a hold harmless to

 6   where we were last year.

 7           So the Executive Budget provisions

 8   have certain set-asides for DAP.    We are

 9   asking the Legislature to add on $3 million

10   in addition to what's already in the

11   Executive Budget to keep the DAP program

12   funded at $8.26 million this year as it was

13   last year, even with the additional burden of

14   the mandatory consideration process.

15           Additionally you've heard a fair

16   amount already from my colleagues at the

17   Schuyler Center, the Early Care & Learning

18   Council, Winning Beginning you'll hear from,

19   the Association for the Education of Young

20   Children, about the critical need for

21   childcare.   In your written comments are

22   robust data and information speaking to that

23   need.

24           I cannot summarize that for you and do
                                                     404

 1   it justice.   What I will say is that it is a

 2   total investment consistent with Winning

 3   Beginning NY and the Empire State Childcare

 4   Campaign looking for $60 million to increase

 5   access to childcare and then $40 million to

 6   increase workforce compensation and quality

 7   of care.

 8         This is critical.     Childcare, as you

 9   know, is a work support.    And while we are

10   looking at low-wage workers and keeping them

11   here, we are also looking at other portions

12   of the safety net being attacked at the

13   federal level.   For those of you who don't

14   know, my primary practice is in the area of

15   SNAP benefits, and what I am thinking about

16   is the fact that SNAP is under attack at the

17   federal level, SNAP benefits potentially

18   stand to be reduced, and to the extent we can

19   take the heat off of low-income families and

20   support them in other ways, this is an

21   opportunity to support families who are going

22   to potentially lose SNAP.

23         There is shifting that can happen

24   here, and should.   And to that end, just in
                                                           405

 1   the smidge of time -- I know there was a

 2   question previously put by the committee, I

 3   believe it was Senator May who asked about

 4   preserving SNAP benefits and whether or not

 5   there was any opportunity to do that at this

 6   time.

 7           I did just want to take this

 8   opportunity to suggest that it would be

 9   useful if in New York we moved to a voluntary

10   rather than a mandatory employment and

11   training.   Right now the employment and

12   training options are distributed by county.

13   Some counties do a mandatory program.        To the

14   extent that there will be additional folks

15   who are forced into employment or training

16   with the loss of ABAWD waivers later this

17   year, freeing those slots would mean that

18   there's administrative flexibility at the

19   county level that would not otherwise be had.

20           Thank you for your time today.

21           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

23   your testimony as well as the extensive

24   information in your submission.

 1            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     It's a

 2   dissertation.    We'll have to put a little

 3   more time on that.

 4            MS. AKHTAR:   Absolutely.

 5            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 6            Next, New York Association for the

 7   Education of Young Children, Kristen Kerr,

 8   executive director.

 9            MS. KERR:   Good afternoon, and thank

10   you for this opportunity to provide testimony

11   today.

12            As mentioned, I am Kristen Kerr, the

13   executive director of the Association for the

14   Education of Young Children.      Our mission is

15   to promote excellence in early care and

16   education for New York State children and

17   families through education, advocacy, and the

18   support of the profession.

19            As a statewide membership organization

20   of over 3,000 early childhood educators, we

21   represent the workforce that shapes the lives

22   of New York's youngest learners.      These

23   members work across settings and are integral

24   in their communities, ensuring that parents
                                                      407

 1   can work with the peace of mind that their

 2   children are safe, learning, and well cared

 3   for.

 4          However, our state economy cannot

 5   reach its full potential when the workforce

 6   it relies on operates in the confines of a

 7   broken system in a state of market failure.

 8   After decades of asking whether high-quality

 9   early education works for young children, it

10   is time to shift our focus to what works best

11   and how we can support it.

12          As we advocate for change at the

13   federal level, we cannot afford to wait for

14   Congress to act.   New York's children and

15   families and early childhood educators need

16   us now.   Today we join with Winning Beginning

17   NY and the Empire State Campaign for

18   Childcare to ask the Legislature to commit to

19   achieving universal access to quality

20   affordable childcare by 2025.

21          Our educators are passionate and

22   committed professionals.   They often remain

23   in our field for decades because caring for

24   and teaching young children is what they
                                                       408

 1   love.   But many do it at a great personal

 2   cost.   An alarming 65 percent of New York's

 3   early educators in childcare settings rely on

 4   supports such as SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and

 5   the Earned Income Tax Credit.   Nationally,

 6   rates of participation of early educators are

 7   double the rates of workers across all

 8   occupations.

 9           Critical to quality early childhood

10   programs are highly educated teachers and

11   caregivers with a deep understanding of child

12   development, and that are well supported and

13   fairly compensated.   Foundational to

14   excellent early learning experiences for

15   children are stable relationships with these

16   educators.

17           High levels of turnover undermine

18   those relationships, creating unease in

19   children and a burden on administrators.      A

20   recent study of early childhood educator

21   turnover rates by the Buffett Early Childhood

22   Initiative found that nationally turnover

23   ranges from 26 and 40 percent of staff per

24   year.   This rate is highest in child care
                                                     409

 1   settings, with 58 percent of child care

 2   administrators identifying salary as the

 3   primary reason teachers leave.

 4          As the minimum wage increases, we have

 5   seen an already dire problem worsen.   Wage

 6   compression has diminished minimal wage

 7   differences between new aides and assistants

 8   and veteran early educators with advanced

 9   degrees.   All workers deserve an adequate

10   living wage, and early educators who dedicate

11   years to pursuing higher education and remain

12   in the field deserve a wage ladder that

13   compensates them fairly in addition to this

14   living wage.

15          A recent Raising New York survey also

16   found that many programs are running at a

17   deficit, and childcare providers who enroll

18   at least one child with a subsidy are more

19   likely to have a deficit than those who do

20   not.   The current market rate for subsidy is

21   too low to provide high quality care for

22   families who need it most.    In fact, it is

23   too low for programs who accept subsidies to

24   remain financially solvent.
                                                     410

 1         High-quality early learning and

 2   childcare experiences must occur in a system

 3   that values early childhood educators and

 4   childcare providers as the workforce that

 5   prepares children for bright futures while

 6   their parents work.   As a member of both the

 7   Empire State Campaign for Childcare and the

 8   Winning Beginning steering committee, we

 9   share in the deep concern that Governor Cuomo

10   included no new state investments for

11   childcare in his Executive Budget.

12         We urge the Legislature to work with

13   the Executive to ensure the following

14   commitments and investments are included in

15   the 2020-2021 final enacted budget:

16         New York commits to achieving

17   universal access to quality, affordable child

18   care by 2025.   And to set New York on a path

19   of meeting this goal of universal access, and

20   to curb the exodus of educators from the

21   field while working towards it, New York

22   makes significant building block investments

23   in child care this year, including investing

24   at least 40 million to create a fund to
                                                          411

 1   increase workforce compensation and improve

 2   the quality of these programs, and at least

 3   60 million in the state's child care subsidy

 4   program to expand access to more working

 5   families by making eligibility levels and

 6   copays more fair and uniform across the

 7   state.

 8            Thank you for considering our budget

 9   request, and we look forward to continuing to

10   work with you to support the children and

11   families and early educators of New York.

12            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Thank you.

13   Thank you for being here.

14            Next, we have New York State Community

15   Mobilization for Housing Works, Elizabeth

16   Deutsch, Jaron Benjamin -- three?     Oh, okay.

17   Good, I was wondering how three people were

18   going to share five minutes.

19            MS. DEUTSCH:   Jaron's not here.     They

20   were just the backups.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Okay.   Thank

22   you.

23            MS. DEUTSCH:   I'm going to try not to

24   read my testimony, but there's things in here
                                                      412

 1   that I don't want to miss.

 2            Thank you for the opportunity to

 3   present testimony to the joint budget hearing

 4   on Human Services.    My name is Elizabeth

 5   Deutsch, and I am the director of New York

 6   State and New England Community Mobilization

 7   for Housing Works, a healing community of

 8   people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.

 9   Housing Works is part of the End AIDS NY 2020

10   Community Coalition, a group of over 90

11   healthcare centers, hospitals, and

12   community-based organizations across the

13   state.    Housing Works and the Community

14   Coalition are fully committed to realizing

15   the goals of our historic state blueprint for

16   Ending the Epidemic for all New Yorkers by

17   the end of the year 2020.

18            Safe, stable housing is essential to

19   support effective antiretroviral treatment

20   that sustains optimal health for people with

21   HIV and makes it impossible to transmit HIV

22   to others.    Indeed, New York State data show

23   that unstable housing is the single strongest

24   predictor of poor HIV outcomes and health
                                                     413

 1   disparities.    The blueprint's housing

 2   recommendations have been fully implemented

 3   in New York City since 2016, where the local

 4   Department of Social Services employs the

 5   New York State HIV Enhanced Shelter Allowance

 6   Program to offer every income-eligible person

 7   with HIV a rental subsidy sufficient to

 8   afford housing stability, and provides a

 9   30 percent rent cap and affordable housing

10   protection for persons who rely on disability

11   benefits or other fixed income.

12         Upstate and on Long Island, however,

13   as many as 4,200 low-income households living

14   with HIV remain homeless or unstably housed,

15   because the state law limits the 30 percent

16   rent cap to residents of New York City -- and

17   the 1980s regulations governing the HIV

18   Enhanced Shelter Allowance set maximum rent

19   at just $480 per month, and only the New York

20   City local Department of Social Services

21   approves rental subsidies in line with fair

22   market rents.

23         It is time to ensure that homeless and

24   unstably housed New Yorkers with HIV
                                                     414

 1   throughout the state have equal access to

 2   vital New York State housing supports by

 3   enabling all local districts to approve rents

 4   in line with local fair market rents and

 5   extending the 30 percent affordable housing

 6   protection to eligible low-income persons

 7   with HIV in every part of New York State.

 8           Indeed, the ongoing failure to meet

 9   this housing need threatens to undermine the

10   ETE plan -- I'm sorry, I'm going to jump

11   ahead because I'm afraid of running out of

12   time.

13           ETE Community Coalition members have

14   been told by social services commissioners

15   outside of New York that they lack the

16   resources required to expand housing options

17   for their community members with HIV who

18   remain homeless or unstably housed.    So we

19   were very pleased that the New York State

20   fiscal year 2020 budget included our proposal

21   to make $5 million in New York State funding

22   available to enable departments of social

23   services outside of New York City to

24   voluntarily partner with local payers and
                                                       415

 1   community-based organizations to pilot

 2   innovative strategies to fund meaningful

 3   rental assistance for homeless and unstably

 4   housed low-income New Yorkers.

 5            This New York State funding would

 6   leverage matching dollars from local

 7   partners, for a total of a $10 million annual

 8   HIV housing investment.    Ample evidence shows

 9   that dollars spent on HIV rental assistance

10   generate Medicaid savings from avoided

11   emergency and inpatient care that offsets the

12   cost of housing supports.

13             However, the fiscal year 2020 budget

14   language included a poison pill that

15   undermined the ability of local districts to

16   secure local partners and propose successful

17   plans.    The Aid to Localities language

18   required that any savings realized through

19   improved housing stability be recaptured to

20   reduce the state investment, while still

21   requiring the local partner providing the

22   matching funds to continue to pay 100 percent

23   of the costs for housed participants in

24   perpetuity.
                                                     416

 1         As we predicted when advocating for a

 2   fix for this budget last year, no local

 3   districts took us up on the offer.    And

 4   consequently, no one was housed last year.

 5         We are pleased that the fiscal year

 6   2021 Executive Budget again includes

 7   $5 million in annual funding for the pilot

 8   program as well as the reappropriation of the

 9   $5 million that went unspent last year.

10   However, we are very dismayed that the

11   proposed language continues to include the

12   same undermining language.

13         It is critical to the success of the

14   pilot program that this language be changed

15   to allow local partners to propose the best

16   use of healthcare savings realized through

17   improved housing status, including sharing

18   savings among the local social services

19   district and the health payer to support

20   programs and administrative costs and provide

21   ongoing HIV housing subsidies.

22          Housing Works and the ETE Community

23   Coalition urge the Governor and the

24   Legislature to fully support this $5 million
                                                        417

 1   rest-of-state HIV housing pilot by including

 2   the revised initiative language in the

 3   enacted FY 2021 budget, and passing

 4   Education, Labor, and Family Assistance

 5   Article VII language to authorize the use of

 6   funds.    We believe that this $10 million

 7   investment will support sufficient housing

 8   subsidies to finally afford equal access to

 9   safe, stable housing for households living

10   with HIV in every part of New York State.

11            (Laughter.)

12            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

13            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

14            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you

15   for -- I believe there are no questions.

16   Thank you.

17            Next, Citizen's Committee for Children

18   of New York, Daryl Hornick-Becker, to be

19   followed -- the next three witnesses are

20   NEW Pride Agenda, Winning Beginning NY, and

21   New York Immigration Coalition.

22            MR. HORNICK-BECKER:     Good afternoon.

23            My name is Daryl Hornick-Becker, and I

24   am a policy and advocacy associate at the
                                                      418

 1   Citizens' Committee for Children of New York.

 2   CCC is a 75-year-old independent multi-issue

 3   child advocacy organization dedicated to

 4   ensuring that every New York child is

 5   healthy, housed, educated, and safe.

 6           I'd like to thank Chair Weinstein,

 7   Chair Krueger, and all the members of the

 8   Assembly Ways and Means and Senate Finance

 9   Committees for holding today's hearing.

10           CCC recognizes the need to be fiscally

11   prudent given the current budget deficit.

12   That said, we are very disappointed that the

13   State Budget is being balanced by cutting and

14   curtailing services for the most vulnerable

15   children and families.   We're also worried

16   that proposed caps on Medicaid spending and

17   caps to TANF funds and initiatives would

18   result in significant cost shifts in New York

19   City.   We urge the Legislature to negotiate a

20   budget that is balanced in a manner that

21   improves the well-being of children, youth

22   and families.

23           For further detail, I refer you to my

24   written testimony.   Today I'll be summarizing
                                                      419

 1   some key issues across the human services

 2   sector.

 3         For childcare, the Executive Budget

 4   proposes no new solutions to the current

 5   crisis that is facing New York.   High-quality

 6   childcare is an expensive necessity, and

 7   helpful subsidies currently serve fewer than

 8   20 percent of low-income families.

 9   Additionally, early childhood educators in

10   many regions of the state are paid so little

11   that many are living in or near poverty.

12         The Governor commissioned a Childcare

13   Task Force over two years ago, and yet the

14   Executive Budget includes no significant new

15   investments.   It does include an expansion of

16   the childcare tax credit, but it would be a

17   mistake to think that a credit of $330 per

18   year could have any meaningful impact on

19   families facing average childcare costs of

20   $15,000 annually per child.

21         We urge the Assembly and Senate to

22   invest $100 million in childcare:

23   $40 million to create a fund to increase

24   salaries, and $60 million for subsidies to
                                                     420

 1   increase eligibility and decrease families'

 2   copayments.

 3         CCC was also disappointed to see only

 4   a small investment for statewide universal

 5   pre-K that would impact an estimated 2,000

 6   children -- despite the 77,000 four-year olds

 7   outside of New York City without access to

 8   full-day pre-K.   We urge the Legislature to

 9   invest $150 million in universal pre-K, to

10   add seats, and to fund regional assistance

11   centers.

12         In the area of after-school, we

13   applaud the Governor for adding $10 million

14   in a fourth round of Empire State After

15   School grants, but were disappointed to see

16   the same budget propose a $5 million cut to

17   the Advantage After School Program that would

18   force 2,500 children to lose their

19   after-school programming.   We urge the

20   Legislature to restore that funding and to

21   add an additional $5 million to increase

22   per-pupil rates, to maintain services, and to

23   accommodate rising operational costs.

24         Turning to child welfare, CCC is
                                                       421

 1   deeply concerned with the Executive Budget's

 2   proposed $25 million reduction in funds to

 3   OCFS.   The state also continues to reduce

 4   reimbursements of preventive services to

 5   62 percent despite statute requiring a

 6   65 percent match.    We urge the Legislature to

 7   restore these funds, invest in preventive

 8   services, and help decrease the number of

 9   children placed in foster care.

10           We're also concerned that the state

11   continues to fund KinGAP within the Foster

12   Care Block Grant, causing it to be

13   under-utilized across the state.     There's a

14   clear opportunity to expand the use of KinGAP

15   by funding it outside of the block grant,

16   similar to how adoption subsidies are funded.

17           In the area of juvenile justice, the

18   CCC was very excited to see the new section

19   of correction law requiring all adolescent

20   offenders to be transferred from DOCCS to

21   OCFS facilities.    To build on this progress,

22   CCC urges the Legislature to consider several

23   youth justice initiatives.    First, we are

24   demanding an end to all forms of solitary
                                                       422

 1   confinement in adolescent facilities,

 2   reversing current practice that permits

 3   children to be held in isolation for 18 to

 4   22 hours a day.

 5         Second, we're asking to create a new

 6   young adult status up to age 25, allowing

 7   youth 19 years and older the same protections

 8   as offered under the Youthful Offender Law.

 9         And third, we are asking to lower the

10   age of juvenile delinquency from 7 to 12 to

11   end the prosecution of children who under

12   current law can be subject to police

13   questioning and confinement.

14         In the area of homelessness, CCC was

15   pleased to see the Executive Budget's

16   investment in supportive housing, but it's

17   unclear how it will be prioritized to impact

18   families experiencing homelessness who make

19   up the majority of residents in shelters.    We

20   urge the Legislature to combat family

21   homelessness by addressing one of its lead

22   drivers, domestic violence.

23         This year's budget should include

24   flexible funding for a Rapid Rehousing for
                                                        423

 1   Domestic Violence Survivors pilot program, a

 2   HUD-approved model that connects survivors to

 3   safe, affordable permanent housing.

 4         The human services sector is a

 5   critical component of the fabric of our

 6   state, but budget reductions and cost shifts

 7   to localities ultimately impede the sector's

 8   ability to respond to the needs of vulnerable

 9   New Yorkers.   The current budget deficit must

10   not be balanced on the backs of New York's

11   children and families.

12         Thank you for this opportunity to

13   testify.

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

15         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

16         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you for

17   being here.

18         Next, Cynthia Dames, NEW Pride Agenda.

19         MS. DAMES:    Thank you very much.

20         Cynthia Dames.     I know many of you

21   from my prior life doing government affairs

22   for nonprofits, some old friends, some new

23   friends, and I have embarked on a new -- one

24   last mission to try to move the ball.      Thank
                                                     424

 1   you.   Nice seeing you again.

 2          Many of you know the history -- I'm

 3   just going to speak from my separate notes.

 4   Many of you of course know the long history

 5   regarding Empire State Pride Agenda.    I had

 6   the privilege of working for them as a

 7   lobbyist in the early years under Alan van

 8   Capelle.   We worked very hard regarding the

 9   passage of marriage equality in the Assembly,

10   and of course we're enormously gratified by

11   its full conclusion and implementation.

12          A number of us were dismayed when ESPA

13   closed down because we felt there's a variety

14   of discriminatory issues that continue,

15   particularly for young people, people of

16   color, transgender community, communities --

17   LGBTQ communities of poverty, and really a

18   remarkable dearth of LGBTQ-sensitive services

19   upstate.   Really, really striking.

20          And so we formed the NEW Pride

21   Agenda -- you know, more women-led, more

22   diverse, a variety of trans membership.    We

23   just got new board members from Rochester,

24   we're recruiting in Buffalo, Long Island,
                                                        425

 1   Western New York, et cetera.    We are

 2   committed to developing a statewide,

 3   ground-up LGBTQ organization.

 4            We're focusing on civic engagement

 5   beginning in New York City, but we'll do that

 6   as well upstate, and of course advocacy.      So

 7   one of our major issues this fall that we

 8   worked on -- probably as a prior lobbyist,

 9   knowing and sensitive to the need for

10   implementation of law when the law is little

11   trickier or a little more challenging -- and

12   so we had a variety of meetings all fall

13   about ideas regarding implementation of

14   GENDA.    And we very much encourage the

15   Governor to think about mandating state

16   employees have an understanding of it.     We're

17   very gratified he included that in the State

18   of the State.

19            We're very gratified that the

20   Department of Human Rights is going to start

21   a public education campaign to understand

22   GENDA, and the companion to that, in our

23   judgement, would be an awareness -- a

24   training program, trans-led, in different
                                                       426

 1   areas of the state, particularly with those

 2   that are responsible for implementing the

 3   law, whether you're in education or housing,

 4   employment, and certainly medical facilities.

 5   Perhaps in a phased-in approach.

 6         So we're suggesting, starting in a

 7   modest way, $1.5 million that would be

 8   distributed in four or five areas throughout

 9   the state, different regions, all for you to

10   be decided.    But trans-led training.

11         And I just want to do a separate

12   comment.    When marriage happened, we all

13   understand marriage.   Marriage has gone on

14   for hundreds and thousands of years.      There

15   wasn't a huge educational component needed.

16   But when you talk about individuals having a

17   disconnect between mind and heart and body,

18   and going through transitions and becoming

19   transgender, that's something very hard for

20   many people to understand.

21         And we are sympathetic to that.       I'm

22   learning about it myself.    I'm in trans

23   training.    My 22-year-old daughter has more

24   trans friends, I'm sure, than I do.      It's
                                                       427

 1   generational.   It's different.   And so we're

 2   really -- we know the need, sometimes, to

 3   really get behind the wheel and help laws

 4   become real.

 5          And so we're asking your indulgence to

 6   consider trans training statewide that would

 7   help employers and others understand the

 8   differences and how to be respectful and how

 9   to respond.    We ourselves at NEW Pride Agenda

10   did a statewide survey, and the overwhelming

11   response was not that people weren't

12   well-meaning when one went for a job or

13   medical facilities, but they were just

14   ignorant.   They didn't have knowledge about

15   it.   They didn't know what to do about it.

16          So this is not about blame, this is

17   not about punishment, this is like --

18   consider please putting some money forward to

19   help this continuation of really implementing

20   GENDA in a way that it needs to be

21   implemented for people to understand it

22   better.

23          We thank you also for some

24   discretionary support we got for NEW Pride
                                                          428

 1   Agenda for downstate organizing.       We hope to

 2   get some for upstate as well.      And thank you

 3   for your consideration.       It's nice seeing you

 4   all again.

 5           Any questions?   Okay, thank you very

 6   much.

 7           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you,

 8   Cynthia.

 9           Winning Beginning NY, is anybody here?

10   Okay.   Have you -- did you submit testimony

11   at the desk?    Okay, kind of.

12           Okay.   Gregory Brender?

13           MR. BRENDER:   Yes.

14           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Okay.   You're

15   on.

16           MR. BRENDER:   Thank you so much for

17   the opportunity to testify and for sticking

18   it out on a long day.

19           Winning Beginning NY is a New York

20   State statewide early care and learning

21   coalition.   We work on issues from prenatal

22   to 8 years old, and we bring together many

23   groups throughout the state.       So a lot of

24   what is in my testimony you actually heard
                                                     429

 1   from many of our colleagues.

 2         Just to sort of say who we are, we

 3   work with different groups throughout the

 4   state, and our steering committee includes

 5   Advocates for Children, the Chautauqua Lake

 6   Childcare Center, Early Care and Learning

 7   Council, Center for Children's Initiatives,

 8   Network for Youth Success, New York State

 9   Association for the Education of Young

10   Children, Prevent Child Abuse New York,

11   United Neighborhood Houses -- where I serve

12   as the director of children and youth

13   services -- and the Western New York Women's

14   Foundation.

15         I want to highlight two key pieces

16   where we see this budget really falling short

17   of serving children and families and their

18   communities.   First, as you've heard from

19   several of my colleagues around childcare,

20   there's deep disappointment that despite the

21   convening of a task force started in 2018 and

22   the need of communities throughout the state,

23   that the Executive Budget takes no action to

24   address really the crisis in childcare for
                                                       430

 1   New York's children and families.

 2         Working with many of the

 3   community-based organizations who provide

 4   childcare, we see how desperate so many

 5   families are to get their children into

 6   something affordable, and how difficult it is

 7   for those families to afford child care, and

 8   so we ask that the Legislature not wait until

 9   this task force completes its convenings but

10   takes action in this budget to move forward

11   to expanding childcare.

12         In particular, we ask that New York

13   commits to achieving universal access to

14   quality affordable childcare by 2025,

15   starting with two investments this year.    One

16   is to invest at least $40 million to create a

17   fund that will increase workforce

18   compensation and improve childcare quality.

19   Program quality, making sure that these are

20   places where people want to have their

21   children, and making sure that childcare

22   programs are the kind of programs that really

23   build on the benefits of childcare, requires

24   a staff who are stable, who are
                                                        431

 1   well-compensated, and who are well-trained.

 2         And then also investing $60 million to

 3   both increase family eligibility, so that

 4   more low-income families can access

 5   childcare.   As well as to decrease the copays

 6   that parents pay.    Because even with

 7   subsidies, many parents are struggling to pay

 8   for childcare.

 9         I also want to quickly address

10   after-school.     For now I think the ninth year

11   in a row, the Governor's budget has proposed

12   cutting $5 million from the Advantage After

13   School Program.    This would affect 2,500

14   children.    This is not something -- when we

15   know that families are trying to get their

16   kids into after-school and we know how

17   important it is for families' work schedules

18   and for childrens' development, this is not a

19   cut that should be proposed.

20         We also want to ask the Legislature to

21   push to increase rates in both the Advantage

22   After School Program and the Empire State

23   After School Program to 23.20 per child.

24   These are programs that in many cases are
                                                     432

 1   struggling to pay their staff and struggling

 2   to maintain quality.

 3         Thank you for the opportunity to

 4   testify.   And are there any questions?

 5         Okay, thank you very much.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

 7   being here.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you for

 9   testifying.

10         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    And the final

11   witness of today's hearing, New York

12   Immigration Coalition, Alana Cantillo.

13         MS. CANTILLO:    Hi, good afternoon.

14   Thank you for convening this hearing.     My

15   name is Alana Pilar Cantillo, and I'm the

16   senior director of advocacy for the New York

17   Immigration Coalition.

18         On behalf of the NYIC and its 200

19   nonprofit organizations that make up our

20   membership, I'm here to urge the inclusion

21   and renewal and increase of funding to the

22   New York State Enhanced Services for Refugees

23   Program, also known as NYSESRP, in the

24   FY '20-'21 budget.
                                                     433

 1          The Enhance Services for Refugees

 2   Program is administered among the refugees

 3   services programs in the Office of Temporary

 4   and Disability Assistance.   It began in 2017

 5   as a remarkable response to the federal

 6   government's retreat from refugee

 7   resettlement.   New York State did what no

 8   other state would:   provide flexible state

 9   funds to support the state's strong network

10   of resettlement agencies through a difficult

11   time, and help them reframe their focus on

12   integration.

13          New York State allocated $2 million

14   for NYSESRP in fiscal years '18, '19, and

15   '20.   Because of the continued federal cuts

16   in support of refugee integration, the NYIC,

17   as part of New York for Refugees -- a

18   coalition of 16 agencies resettling refugees,

19   along with the Fiscal Policy Institute --

20   together we are requesting $5 million in

21   FY '20-'21.

22          NYSESRP delivers measurable impact.

23   In the past year alone, the program has

24   provided nearly 8,000 unique services to
                                                     434

 1   refugees, including almost 5,000 case

 2   management integration services, over 1,000

 3   employment training services, and 600

 4   connections to English language courses.

 5         NYSESRP allows agencies to concentrate

 6   on long-term integration in a way that

 7   addresses the needs of each client, unlike

 8   existing federal programs, which focus merely

 9   on the first 90 days after arrival.    This

10   flexible funding and extended case management

11   opportunities allows agencies to provide

12   deeper and broader support, benefiting

13   refugees and communities.   In challenging

14   times, this program is continuing to

15   establish best practices.

16         NYSESRP is a model for other states

17   around the country.   New York State was the

18   first, Oregon followed suit last year, and

19   advocates in California and states across the

20   country have repeatedly reached out and

21   inquired about New York State's program in

22   order for advocates, service providers around

23   the state to receive the sort of best

24   practices that have been established here in
                                                     435

 1   New York.

 2         The state's $2 million investment

 3   shows that New York is committed to refugees

 4   and the agencies that serve them.     This is

 5   critical, as over 50 refugee-serving

 6   organizations in the United States have

 7   closed permanently, and over 40 have ceased

 8   resettling refugees since 2017.

 9         I'm going to jump ahead to just note

10   that the refugee resettlement population is

11   on the decline and supports populations that

12   are aging across upstate New York, in some

13   cases even tipping cities toward population

14   rebound.    The majority of primary

15   resettlement in New York is in upstate

16   communities, over 90 percent.   Resettlement

17   agencies also play a key role downstate,

18   helping individuals reach their full

19   potential in economic and social integration.

20         NYSESRP attracts secondary migrants to

21   New York as well.   Because of the state's

22   support, New York's resettlement agencies and

23   communities welcome people from Bhutan,

24   Somalia, Burma, Afghanistan, Congo, and other
                                                       436

 1   countries from across the United States to be

 2   settled in New York.

 3         When refugee and immigrant communities

 4   are more prominent, it also attracts young

 5   people who want to live in vibrant and

 6   diverse areas.    A strong network of services

 7   that support the success of secondary

 8   migrants is critical to positive outcomes for

 9   the communities they choose to live in.

10   Without the state's NYSESRP program, there is

11   no statewide network.

12         This is a critical moment for New York

13   State to take action.    The federal government

14   has put the refugee resettlement program

15   under even further strain as years have gone

16   by, setting the Presidential Determination

17   that governs the maximum number of refugees

18   to be resettled at a 40-year low -- around

19   8,000 arrivals.    Because that represents

20   another devastating cut to our agencies'

21   sustainability, NYSESRP is asking that the

22   Governor and the Legislature increase support

23   in the state's budget from $2 million to

24   $5 million.
