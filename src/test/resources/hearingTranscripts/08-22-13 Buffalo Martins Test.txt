       1             SENATOR MARTINS:  [No audio] on Tuesday, to

       2      hold our first hearing in Syracuse, which was very

       3      interesting.

       4             Apparently, we have many challenges ahead of

       5      us, and all of that was brought to stark reality

       6      with the filing of bankruptcy by Detroit just a

       7      month ago.

       8             It raised some real issues for us here in

       9      New York.

      10             Certainly, we're aware of how difficult it is

      11      for many of our municipalities, in dealing with this

      12      fiscal crisis, to make ends meet.  And we're

      13      certainly aware of the difficulties affecting, not

      16      been so drastically impacted.

      17             Historically, this just adds to that, so we

      18      felt it was appropriate, that we not only hold these

      19      hearings to discuss, not only how the State should

      20      be responding, and how we should be conducting

      21      ourselves, and perhaps look at potential

      22      legislation, but, also, New York has historically

      23      used control boards as a means of intervention to

      24      prevent bankruptcy.

      25             And we have many examples of those, but some
