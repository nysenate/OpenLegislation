5       ASSEMBLY STANDING COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS,

6       AUTHORITIES AND COMMISSIONS:                    Welcome everyone.

7       We are having a joint hearing, the Assembly and

8       Senate on the MTA and what we know is a fiscal

9       crisis. I'm going to take first, I'm the chair,

10      Amy Paulin, of the Corporations Committee and I'm

11      first going to introduce the other members of the

12      Assembly who are here today, in no particular

13      order, Assembly Member Charles Fall, Assembly

14      Member David Buchwald, Assembly Member Nely

18      Member Steve Otis, Assembly Member Vivian Cook

19      and Assembly Member Ken Blankenbush.

20                  I am going to take a minute to just give

21      some opening remarks and then turn it over to my

22      senate colleagues. So many New Yorkers have

23      relied on a combination of Metro-North, LIRR, the

24      subway and buses to get to their jobs each day.

2       Many have taken advantage of the cultural meccas,

3       the economic opportunities and the personal

4       connections they have in New York City.

5                  Since I moved to Westchester in 1980,

6       I've been using Metro-North. Having grown-up in

7       Brooklyn, I've been using the subways longer. Our

8       transit system is the key reason our community is

9       as robust as it is. These past few months, this

10      health pandemic has put this vital resource in

11      jeopardy. The MTA's fiscal situation is dire, not

12      only in its need for capital investments to

13      stabilize and modernize, but now for the very

14      operating dollars to keep the trains running.

15                 I fear what will happen if the federal

16      government doesn't come through for New York.

17      Sustainable funding is not possible without it.

18      Today, we're here to listen and understand the

19      depth of the problem. Today, we're here to listen

20      and understand the options before us. I know

21      there are no silver bullets, that most of the

22      options available will be difficult and painful

23      for someone to bear.

2       on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions,

3       I've had the opportunity to work closely with the

4       administration, the advocates and the hard-

5       working men and women who operate the system.

6       I've come to appreciate the expertise, the talent

7       and the dedication of the frontline employees and

8       operators of our mass transit system who work

9       hard every day and who have put their own lives

10      on the line during this crisis.

11                 I thank all of you here that are about

12      to share your thoughts. It will truly help me to

13      do a better job, as together we work to save our

14      transportation system, our communities and our

15      state. Thank you. I'd like to turn it over to the

16      Senate.

17                 SENATOR TIM KENNEDY, CHAIR, SENATE

18      STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION:                         Well,

19      thank you so much Assemblywoman Paulin and thank

20      you for your leadership as chair and for co-

21      chairing today's event. I want to recognize my

22      colleague in the Senate and the chairman of

23      authorities and corporations and that is Senator

24      Leroy Comrie who is also co-chairing this event

2       with us today. I'm Senator Tim Kennedy, I'm the

3       chair of transportation. I want to recognize our

4       colleagues in the Senate that are here with us

5       today as well. Senator Ramos, Senator Gounardes,

6       Senator Kaminsky, Senator Kaplan, Senator Rivera,

7       and I think that's it. If I missed anybody my

8       apologies and I know there will be more coming

9       in. Oh, Senator Tom O'Mara as well joined us.

10                   So I just want to take this opportunity

11      to thank everybody joining us on this important

12      conversation that we'll have today. We recognize

13      that this pandemic has upended our entire global

14      economy. And it is hit us here in the United

15      States particularly hard, and here in the state

16      of New York the hardest. And it hit us the

17      hardest because it hit us first. We had to react

18      to it first and we have done a tremendous job of

19      beating back the curve but we have to continue to

20      stay vigilant, keep our eyes open, continue to

21      practice our proper precautions and take this

22      seriously so we don't see a resurgence in the

23      virus.

24                   That being said, as it's upended our

2       economy it has certainly upended transportation

3       as we know it and the economic impact that

4       transportation, particularly public

5       transportation plays on our economy locally,

6       statewide and nationally. The MTA is a critical

7       component, the most critical component to our

8       economy not only in the downstate region that

9       serves millions of people each and every day but

10      across this great state. As we know, that it

11      supports thousands upon thousands upon thousands

12      of jobs, as well as our national economy.

13                 And so it's so critical that we get to

14      the bottom of how the MTA reacted to the

15      pandemic, where we have come from, where we are

16      today, and where we are headed into the future. I

17      am inspired by the work of those that make the

18      system run each and every day. I want to

19      recognize the laborers, the workforce, those that

20      operate the system, those that maintain the

21      system, those that clean the system, those that

22      prepare the system for functioning each and every

23      day. And those that eat, sleep and breathe the

24      MTA system so that others can utilize it to

2       function in their own lives.

3                  I'm proud to be a part of this today.

4       And before I pass it over to my colleague and

5       great co-chair of this event, Senator Leroy

6       Comrie I would like us to recognize and honor all

7       of those workers who have sacrificed so much each

8       and every day, particularly through this pandemic

9       and especially those that have lost their lives

10      due to the pandemic, because they chose to go to

11      work to make the system run. And the thousands of

12      people that were infected and have had to alter

13      the entirety of their lives to deal with the

14      health implications, we are grateful and indebted

15      to your service to the respective communities

16      thank you for your work and sacrifice. Now, over

17      to Chairman Leroy Comrie.

18                 SENATOR LEROY COMRIE, CHAIR, SENATE

19      STANDING COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS, AUTHORITIES

20      AND COMMISSIONS:           Thank you, Chairman Kennedy,

21      thank you Co-Chair Paulin. I thank all my

22      colleagues that have joined. I see we were joined

23      by Senator Luis Sepulveda, Senator Jessica Ramos,

24      I think was mentioned and all my assembly

2       colleagues as well. I thank the MTA for being

3       here and their leadership team, Chair Foye and

4       also to the advocates, the riders and the

5       concerned citizens. But especially the members of

6       the MTA, because to echo what Senator Kennedy

7       said, the essential workers that never stopped

8       working however they lost many members to the MTA

9       due to COVID-19, because they insisted on trying

10      to maintain the system even throughout the heart

11      of the pandemic when nobody knew how it was

12      spreading or where it was spreading, workers came

13      out and did what they had to do. So I agree with

14      Senator Kennedy, we cannot thank them enough for

15      their stalwartness and their diligence in trying

16      to maintain the system.

17                 Our hearing today is at a critical time

18      in our state, and an interesting time in our

19      world, to find out what the MTA has been working

20      on over the past few months to meet the

21      challenges of this pandemic, what they have been

22      doing to make sure that the system is operating

23      properly. As we know right now, the system is not

24      operating 24 hours a day, even though for the



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       last 100 years it has. We are concerned about the

3       when and what is the process and what are the

4       plans to see the system come back to 24-hour

5       service. But we're also primarily concerned with

6       what will be the plans to try to maintain the

7       service, in spite of the fact that we are not

8       sure what's going to happen on the federal level.

9                  The changes that have been impacting the

10      system and creating a concern for both the

11      employees and the advocates and the ridership are

12      some things that we look forward to hear about

13      how the MTA is going to take on the challenges.

14      We know that everything that the average strap

15      hanger has to endure and how quickly we can get

16      back to a world class system is important to

17      people throughout the tri-state area and we need

18      to understand the MTA's position how to handle

19      that both on a state and federal level.

20                 With that, we also are very concerned

21      about what the MTA can do with the existing

22      capital plan, what the MTA will be doing to

23      ensure ridership and what MTA will be able to do

24      to address safety in this particular time. We

2       have many concerns throughout and I look forward

3       to hearing from my colleagues today and also the

4       unions and all of the other folks, the advocates

5       that are interested in where we are with the MTA

6       so that we can be able to do everything we can as

7       a community to try to make changes, improvements

8       and opportunities so that we can get back to a

9       system that can operate safely and adequately for

10      all. With that I'll turn it over. We will hear

11      now from the MTA who is here, I believe.

12                 And Chairman Foye is I believe here and

13      ready to give us a statement and I believe this

14      leadership team is here as well. We will wait for

15      them to bring them online so that they can start

16      their testimony. Again, thank you all my

17      colleagues for being here. I look forward to a

18      robust hearing today.

19                 MR. PATRICK J. FOYE, CHAIRMAN & CEO,

20      METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY:                            Thank

21      you. Senator Comrie, can you hear me?

22                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Yes.

2       Chair Kennedy and Chair Paulin and your

3       colleagues for your leadership during these

4       challenging times. I'm joined by my colleagues

5       today, Sarah Feinberg, the interim president of

6       New York City Transit, Bob Foran, to my right,

7       who is the chief financial officer of the MTA and

8       to his right, Janno Lieber, who is the president

9       of MTA construction and development.

10                  I'd like to start with two opening

11      points. First, the very survival of the MTA and

12      the existence of millions of jobs lie squarely in

13      the hands of the federal government. Continued

14      federal indifference and inertia on a relief bill

15      will exact the heavy toll on the MTA, our heroic

16      workforce and millions of hardworking New

17      Yorkers, our customers in the New York region and

18      people all over the state of New York working on

19      MTA projects, rail cars, buses signaling and

20      more.

21                  Second opening point I'd like to make is

22      a word about the Great Depression. We measure

23      financial and social calamity in the United

24      States against the Great Depression, millions

2       thrown out of work and out of their homes. You

3       May be surprised to know that the effect of the

4       COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated by federal inaction

5       has exacted a far greater toll on MTA subway

6       ridership, there was no MTA back then, of course,

7       which at its worst, was down 95 percent this

8       spring and today is down approximately 75

9       percent. Subway ridership after the October 1929

10      stock market crash peaked in 1930 at slightly

11      over two million riders and declined modestly,

12      about 12 percent by 1933 in the following years.

13                 We have never, New York has never even

14      during the Great Depression of the 1930s, seen

15      ridership declines as severe and as sustained as

16      those we are experiencing right now. And we have

17      never, New York has never, even during the Great

18      Depression, seen revenue losses like today's.

19                 Last time we appeared before you in

20      January, the MTA was doing remarkably well. We

21      reported six straight months of on time

22      performance above 80 percent, the highest

23      ridership since 2017. We projected a surplus for

24      this year of about $81 million. The historic

2       $51.5 billion MTA capital program had just been

3       approved by the CPRB. MTA transportation revenue

4       bonds were rated AA or AA-, depending on the

5       agency.

6                   Now the MTA is facing an unprecedented

7       crisis brought on by COVID-19 pandemic, which has

8       devastated our agency. It's affected our heroic

9       workforce. We mourn and grieve the loss of every

10      one of our 131 colleagues who have tragically

11      succumbed to the virus. We will never forget

12      them.

13                  It's also obliterated MTA finances. We

14      are facing $16 billion of aggregate deficits

15      through 2024. We urgently need $12 billion from

16      the federal government to get us through the

17      remainder of 2020 and 2021.

18                  Our top priority remains safety first

19      and foremost of our customers and our employees.

20      I'm proud to say that the MTA led transportation

21      agencies nationwide for aggressive response and

22      continue to set the example for agencies across

23      the country.

24                  We've adapted in real time as

2       researchers and scientists learned more about the

3       virus. We're running service to move New York

4       City through the peak. MTA operating personnel

5       were heroes moving heroes, carrying essential

6       workers such as first responders, healthcare

7       workers, fellow transit workers, those working in

8       grocery stores, pharmacies, police officers,

9       firefighters, et cetera.

10                 Now as we run near normal service

11      ridership is depressed. As of last week, subway,

12      about 1.3 million riders daily, down 75 percent.

13      On buses 1.2 million riders, down 40 percent,

14      Long Island Rail Road ridership, down 76 percent,

15      Metro-North down 83 percent. Revenues have

16      declined dramatically.

17                 We're focused on protecting customers

18      and employees. There's no evidence to date that

19      public transportation any place in the nation or

20      around the world has contributed to any virus

21      clusters, whether here in New York, around the

22      nation or around the world. We've worked closely

23      throughout the entire pandemic with federal,

24      state and local health officials and taken their

2       guidance. We've instituted comprehensive cleaning

3       and disinfecting programs, which have been

4       implemented system wide.

5                   In the beginning, we started with high-

6       touch surfaces in each station once a day and

7       every single train car. Bus and transit

8       paratransit vehicles at least one every 72 hours.

9       Shortly after that, we increased to disinfecting

10      each station at least twice a day with rolling

11      stock disinfected at least once a day but often

12      more. Surveys of our customers show that 70

13      percent of customers say the system, the subway

14      system, stations and subway cars are cleaner than

15      ever.

16                  And we've gone above and beyond to keep

17      mass transit safe. We implemented on May 6, the

18      first overnight closure in the subway's 116-year

19      history. We did that to allow every subway

20      station and car to be disinfected on the regime

21      that I just described.

22                  To serve those traveling during these

23      periods, we've added bus routes and added more

24      bus routes. We have been piloting with our chief

2       innovation officer innovative new technology and

3       cleaning materials, from ultraviolet C light to

4       antimicrobials to electrostatic sprayers and are

5       now doing a proof of concept on far ultraviolet

6       light.

7                    Masks, masks, masks. The most important

8       thing that our customers can do to protect

9       themselves and protect their fellow commuters and

10      our employees is to wear a mask. Wearing a mask

11      is law of the state of New York as a result of

12      Governor Cuomo's executive order. It's right

13      thing to do also to protect yourself, fellow

14      commuters and employees and no one is welcome on

15      public transit without a mask.

16                   We've been going beyond that. We're

17      offering free masks, hand sanitizers in stations,

18      we've installed dozens of PPE, personal

19      protective equipment vending machines in subway

20      stations, Long Island Rail Road stations and

21      Metro-North. In addition, we're piloting mask

22      dispenser boxes on buses. We have a mask force,

23      volunteers who have gone out in the system, I've

24      done it myself on the 7 line, E, 4, 5, and 6 and

2       bus lines in Queens, to hand out masks to those

3       few who don't have them and to give them to other

4       customers who may need them tomorrow or the next

5       trip.

6                   And we've been robustly communicating

7       through PSAs and messaging in stations, on subway

8       cars, on buses, on commuter rails, et cetera. The

9       Long Island Rail Road developed a new app and

10      we're piloting on buses, to share real time

11      information about crowding conditions to help

12      riders make informed choices. We're looking to

13      expand that.

14                  In terms of protecting our heroic

15      employees, since March 1st, we've distributed

16      over 6.4 million masks, 8.4 million pairs of

17      gloves, nearly 60,000 gallons of hand sanitizer,

18      about 5.6 million sanitizing wipes and nearly

19      160,000 gallons of cleaning solution. We've

20      created the first in the nation temperature

21      brigade to check employees as they arrive to

22      work. We implemented rear door boarding in

23      cooperation with our unions on buses on March

24      20th to protect operators. We plan on resuming

2       fare collection on August 31 with new protections

3       in place to minimize health risks to bus

4       operators. We've installed Plexiglas and vinyl

5       barriers on buses, van share rides and Access-A-

6       Ride and required new training for Access-A-Ride

7       drivers and operators.

8                  We established the first in the nation

9       generous family benefit programs for the families

10      of fallen transit workers, a $500,000 payment to

11      the family members and up to three years in

12      health benefits. To date, payments to 14 families

13      have been processed, working with others to make

14      sure they get what they need. Sarah Feinberg has

15      appointed ambassadors to work with each of the

16      families. We've extended special line of duty

17      pension benefits to the survivors of fallen

18      employees in accordance with the law passed by

19      the legislature earlier this year.

20                 But let me talk about the budget impact.

21      The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is worse than

22      any crisis we've faced in the past, worse than

23      the financial situation in the `70s and early

24      `80s, worse than the aftermath of 9/11, worse

2       than Hurricane Sandy and the Great Recession of

3       2008-2009. There was no MTA back then but worse,

4       too, than the Great Depression.

5                  We project aggregate budget deficits of

6       $16 billion through 2024. 2020 losses are greater

7       than that of 37 of 39 states surveyed in a survey

8       for 2020. And 35 of 39 surveyed states in 2021.

9       Today, the MTA is losing about $200 million a

10      week in revenues from losses in fares, toll

11      subsidies and COVID related expenses.

12                 Our sole focus now is on survival. How

13      to reduce costs, maintain service and minimize

14      reductions in force while protecting the capital

15      program. We're doing everything we can to cut

16      down on nonessential spending, we are on track to

17      achieve annual recurring savings of $3.5 billion

18      by 2020. And we've renewed the need for

19      transformation. We are already started

20      streamlining operations through consolidation and

21      reduction of primarily 1,000 administrative

22      positions, mostly through attrition.

23                 Outside of federal funding none of our

24      options are good. We'll be discussing the

2       following options with our board tomorrow, as we

3       have in the past two months. No resolution will

4       be tabled tomorrow nor will any vote be taken.

5       Fiscal calamity may force us to take draconian

6       actions. First wage freezes, second fare and toll

7       hikes above those planned, third, reductions in

8       service and reductions in workforce as a last

9       resort. The capital plan, as most of you know, is

10      already on pause. Gutting it completely might

11      provide short-term relief but with a devastating

12      long-term impact perpetuating cycles of

13      disinvestment and inequity in communities not

14      served by the existing system.

15                 We will be forced to sacrifice if we

16      don't get federal funding projects, large and

17      small, that each of you have advocated on behalf

18      of your constituents. That includes re-signaling

19      subways, ADA accessibility projects, vital state

20      of good repair work and mega projects like Second

21      Avenue subway phase two, which would extend the

22      Second Avenue subway into 125th Street in Harlem

23      and Penn Station access, which would include the

24      building of four new stations in the Bronx.

2                  The impact of gutting the capital plan

3       would be felt not only in the New York City

4       region, but statewide. As you all know, and I

5       know this is important to each of you, including

6       Senator Kennedy, the MTA works with vendors all

7       over the state, Kawasaki in Yonkers, Provost in

8       Plattsburgh, Cubic in Buffalo, J-Track in Senator

9       Comrie's district in Queens.

10                 Borrowing to pay operating expenses

11      might keep the lights on at a high cost but

12      brings no tangible benefit. As you know, our

13      credit rating has been downgraded four times

14      since the pandemic, making it more expensive to

15      borrow.

16                 Last week, the MTA sold $450 million in

17      notes through the Federal Reserve, only the

18      second public entity to do so after the state of

19      Illinois. The MTA accessed the municipal

20      liquidity facility when public market demanded

21      substantially higher rate of interest.

22                 But let me conclude by saying,

23      underlining the desperate need for federal

24      assistance. The U.S. Senate must act now and

2       allocate and additional $12 billion to the MTA

3       immediately for operating expenses this year, the

4       remainder of 2020, and next year. The latest

5       Republican proposal shamefully ignored the needs

6       of mass transit nationwide. CARES Act funding for

7       the MTA was exhausted on July 24th, and frankly,

8       we can't wait any longer for additional help.

9                  You all know that the MTA is the

10      lifeblood of New York. No economic recovery and

11      job recovery without a strong MTA is possible.

12      The next round of COVID relief bill must include

13      $12 billion for the MTA to help us get through

14      the remainder of this year and 2021. I'll end

15      where I began.

16                 The survival of public transportation in

17      New York and millions of jobs is squarely in the

18      hands of the federal government. Continued

19      federal indifference and inertia will exact a

20      heavy toll in human terms. The decline in

21      ridership on subways and beyond caused by COVID-

22      19 dwarfs the damage done by the Great

23      Depression. It is past time for the federal

24      government to act on an emergency basis to keep

3       commuter rails and bridges and tunnels running.

4       Thank you and we welcome your questions.

5                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

6       much. It certainly sounds as worse as we had

7       anticipated. I have several questions but I know

8       there's two senators and me. So why don't I turn

9       it back over to the senate for their questions

10      and then I will go since I went first. Each chair

11      has five minutes for their questions and then

12      members have three minutes each, for those

13      members who were not on the pre-call. And I know

14      that since I made the first announcement, Rebecca

15      Seawright and Bobby Carroll joined us. So with

16      that, Senator Kennedy, Senator Comrie, who wants

17      to go first.

18                 SENATOR COMRIE:              I traditionally wait

19      until after the members ask questions to ask

20      mine. I was going to say that we've been joined

21      by Senator Luis Sepulveda and I believe that was

22      it that just joined us. So, I will defer to the

23      members to ask their questions first. Or Senator

24      Kennedy do you want to ask questions first?

2                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               Sure, look, I'll get

3       the conversation started here. I want to talk a

4       little bit about, and first of all thank you

5       Chairman Foye and your team for being here today

6       for participating and for your leadership

7       throughout this entire crisis and beyond.

8                  Overnight subway service was suspended

9       from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. for system cleaning.

10      That seems to be a major point of contention

11      among the ridership. Can you talk a little bit

12      about your process moving forward? I know some of

13      my colleagues even have legislation to rectify

14      that timing to make sure that the system

15      continues to function into the future for our

16      24/7 as it always has, if you could speak to

17      that, please.

18                 MR. FOYE:          Sure, Chairman Kennedy happy

19      to do that. I don't accept the premise of the

20      advocates actually for a couple of reasons,

21      right. We're carrying on the subways, a million

22      three, a million four riders a day. The number

23      and every customer is important and deserves

24      first class service. The number of customers

2       carried in the 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. period is

3       about one percent number, it varies in a ten to

4       15,000 number, but approximately one percent of

5       our riders.

6                  And we're inconveniencing those riders,

7       we recognize but we have dramatically increased

8       the bus service available to those customers. The

9       reason we are inconveniencing those customers is

10      really twofold. One is in order for New York City

11      transit teams led by Sarah Feinberg to be able to

12      disinfect every station and every subway car

13      multiple times a day. And that is a public health

14      essential action. It also reassures our

15      customers, and I've reported the statistics in my

16      opening remarks, that 70 percent of those

17      customers have reported that they've never seen

18      the subways or stations or cars as clean as they

19      are today. That is important.

20                 And obviously, going forward given our

21      financial situation, we're focused on the

22      financial side. So I don't accept the premise of

23      the riders and I think the 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.

2       and TWU personnel to disinfect the stations

3       benefits every customer.

4                   SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you. Do you

5       expect that overnight service to return? And

6       when?

7                   MR. FOYE:          Chair Kennedy, as we've said

8       many times, we will continue disinfecting while

9       the pandemic continues. I'll also say that we are

10      preparing and have been for some months for a

11      second wave that we hope does not come. And we're

12      rooting for an early end to the pandemic and

13      we'll rely on public health officials for that

14      determination.

15                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you. We've heard

16      some concerns about, from particularly from the

17      Metro-North employees about the level of service

18      being a little over 60 percent, which has caused

19      a decrease in the ability for them to properly

20      social distance. Can you speak to that? And what

21      equation is used for that service and what we can

22      do to make sure that number one, the proper

23      service is provided and number two, those that do

24      use the service are able to maintain social

2       distancing and other precautions?

3                  MR. FOYE:          Senator Kennedy, Chair

4       Kennedy, I'm going to disagree with the premise

5       question again, with all due respect, and I

6       realize it's a question coming from Metro-North

7       union officials and we're respectful of that.

8                  The thing we have to take into account

9       is Metro-North is carrying 17 percent of pre-

10      pandemic passenger volumes. At 65, percent one

11      could argue we're providing more service than is

12      necessary A, and B, more service than we can

13      provide.

14                 As I mentioned, one of the alternatives

15      that, and it's not just the commuter rails, but

16      we're going to have to look at the entire agency

17      if we don't get the federal funding, $12 billion

18      for the remainder of the year 2020 and through

19      2021, we're going to have to look at service

20      reductions and reductions in workforce. That is

21      not something that we want to do. Those are last

22      resort actions. But I think given the ridership

23      on Metro-North, which has been stubbornly stuck

24      at 17 percent for days and weeks now, I think



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       we're providing sufficient service.

3                  The other thing I will say is President

4       Cathy Rinaldi, the president of Metro-North has

5       been vigilant in looking for overcrowding

6       situations. The service has been tweaked in

7       cases, but given 17 percent ridership levels

8       compared to pre-pandemic levels, we believe we're

9       providing sufficient service on both the Long

10      Island Rail Road and Metro-North.

11                 I ride the Long Island Rail Road daily

12      and I can report, as Cathy and her team have

13      reported with respect to Metro-North, there is, I

14      haven't seen frankly crowding on any Long Island

15      Rail Road train. I don't ride every branch. I

16      ride the Port Washington branch, as I did this

17      morning, took the 6:45 out of Port Washington and

18      I believe we're providing an appropriate level of

19      service.

20                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you. I see my

21      time is up. I just want two things, one clarify

22      that was a concern from the Metro-North employees

23      not LIRR. But aside from that, I also want to

24      reiterate what you said at the top of your

2       comments, and again, thank you and your team for

3       your leadership. But the federal government has

4       to come through and help us here. And without

5       that, we're going to be in a world of pain that

6       none of us want to see and we just have to keep

7       our eye on the ball and continue to focus and

8       pressure the federal government to do the right

9       thing by the people of New York and quite

10      frankly, the nation. Again, thank you.

11                 MR. FOYE:          Thank you, Chairman.

12                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. I

13      think I will follow the lead of my fellow corps

14      chair and let the members speak first and then

15      I'll speak at the end of that, on the Assembly

16      side. The first Assembly speaker is Bobby

17      Carroll.

18                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT CARROLL:                        Thank

19      you, Chair Paulin and good morning Chair Foye.

20      You know we've been waiting a long time for the

21      federal government. We've been playing this game

22      since March, asking desperately for the federal

23      government to help New York in all of its dire

24      financial needs and there have been some



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       successes early on, but very few recently.

3                  Are there any other avenues that you've

4       discussed with the MTA board or others about

5       raising the requisite revenue so that we do not

6       have an operating death spiral? My fear is that

7       you know if we are trying to revive New York's

8       economy or get people back to school, if suddenly

9       the MTA again reduces service further on subway

10      or bus lines like you suggested, it will become

11      so, so much harder to pull ourselves out of this

12      rut.

13                 MR. FOYE:          So, assembly member, the

14      COVID-19 pandemic is an international issue. It's

15      a national issue. It requires a national

16      solution. The federal government, as you

17      suggested, did provide $3.9 billion in the CARES

18      Act. That was important funding we exhausted that

19      in the middle of July. We were the first public

20      transit agency in the country to exhaust its

21      funding, because our revenue declines, tolls and

22      fares and subsidy payments have been so, so

23      depressed.

24                 Given the financial situation of the



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       state and I will defer to all of you as

3       legislators and policymakers at the state level,

4       but given the financial situation of the state

5       and the city, both of which are appropriately

6       asking for help from the federal government too,

7       it would be -- first, we welcome any revenue from

8       any source.

9                  But it would be inappropriate and I

10      believe under the circumstances to expect the

11      state or the city to come to the MTA's rescue and

12      the only level of government that has the

13      capacity to do that is the federal government as

14      it did on the first round of CARES funding. And

15      it is absolutely essential that we get $12

16      billion of funding.

17                 I want to also just briefly echo Chair

18      Kennedy's remark, which is that the reason to do

19      this is obviously to save the New York City, to

20      save the MTA. But it's also in the national

21      interest to do this given so much of the nation's

22      gross domestic product is generated here in the

23      region, nearly not quite ten percent of that.

24                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARROLL:                     Before my time



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       runs out, Chair Foye, I want to make the point

3       that you know, that there is a federal election

4       happening in November. There may be big changes

5       in D.C. come January. But that's a long time for

6       New Yorkers who are holding on to their

7       businesses, their homes, their schools to be

8       waiting.

9                  What can we do now either by looking at

10      the capital budget, looking at new revenue

11      sources, so that we can get ourselves past this

12      period? Because I don't think you are going to

13      see political changes or choices being made

14      between August 25th and November 4th. And that's

15      a long time.

16                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you

17      assembly member. Thank you.

18                 MR. FOYE:          So, assembly member, here is

19      what I suggest first. You all are in a better

20      position to predict the national election than I.

21      I defer to you on that. Here's what the MTA is

22      doing. First, the capital plan regrettably, the

23      new capital plan, $51.5 billion is on pause.

24      We're not happy about that. The capital plan

2       includes projects that every one of you advocated

3       for on behalf of your constituents. And if you're

4       outside the MTA region, it includes projects that

5       will benefit manufacturing and fabrication plants

6       literally in every region of the state.

7                  What the MTA is doing is reducing costs.

8       In 2021 our financial plan includes a reduction

9       of $800 million. Working with the agency

10      presidents, we've identified well over $500

11      million of non-personnel, non-service reduction

12      costs in 2021. And that's thank to Sarah Feinberg

13      and Phil Eng and Cathy Rinaldi and Dannie

14      DeCrescenzo and Craig Cipriano.

15                 I believe there's more to come. But

16      there is a limit to how much expense we can take

17      out. And the only way that we can bridge this gap

18      is with $12 billion of aid from the federal

19      government period.

13                 SENATOR KAMINSKY:                Thank you.

14                 MR. JANNO LIEBER, CHIEF DEVELOPMENT

15      OFFICER, PRESIDENT, METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION

16      AUTHORITY CONSTRUCTION & DEVELOPMENT:                         Hi,

17      Senator Kaminsky. We are on schedule for both

18      projects and we're on schedule for a third track

19      which I know is something that you have been

20      involved with over the years, the Long Island

21      Rail Road expansion project, yesterday we opened

22      early the grade crossing at New Hyde Park Road.

23      So we continue to remain on schedule for all of

24      those major projects at this time.

2                  SENATOR KAMINSKY:                Okay. Thank you.

3       Chairman Foye, I hear anecdotally from my

4       constituents that they've had some unpleasant

5       experiences at rush hour, taking the train back

6       and forth with non-mask compliance and it's made

7       them not want to take the train again. Can you

8       talk about any stepped up efforts you have to

9       make sure that people are wearing masks and that

10      it's properly enforced.

11                 MR. FOYE:          Senator, great issue. As I

12      mentioned before, the single most important thing

13      that any of us can do is wearing a mask and

14      that's especially true on public transit and it's

15      the law of the State of New York. Here's what

16      we've been doing. We've been handing out masks on

17      subways, buses, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-

18      North. We're going to continue to do that. We,

19      Long Island Rail Road personnel and MTA police

20      have masks and will hand them out.

21                 We are going to do everything we can and

22      senator, I will tell you, as I mentioned before

23      I'm riding the, in my case, the Port Washington

24      branch every day. And I will report and this is



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       not scientific but every Long Island Rail Road

3       employee I encounter has got a mask on without

4       exception. And my anecdotal count is about 95

5       percent of the customers that I see riding the

6       Port Washington line in the morning and the

7       evening have masks.

8                  Our goal is universal mask compliance,

9       that's the law because of the executive order

10      that the governor required. We've also, senator,

11      as you know, been robustly and systemically and

12      repetitively communicating the importance of

13      wearing a mask on Long Island Rail Road cars as

14      an announcement on every train. There's signage,

15      there's signage in Penn Station, there's signage

16      at Jamaica, there's signage at Atlantic terminal.

17      We're going to keep it up and try to get mask

18      compliance to a universal level, which I realize

19      is probably unrealistic, but I think we're at a

20      very high level and we want to continue that.

21                 SENATOR KAMINSKY:                Thank you. And I'll

22      just end by saying that I don't have any

23      illusions as to the financial predicament that

24      your agency's in but I think raising the fares on

2       hard-working Long Islanders who already find it

3       very unaffordable to live here will have the

4       opposite impact in terms of driving up ridership.

5       So I just want to leave you with that and thank

6       you for the work you've done.

7                  MR. FOYE:          Thank you, senator and I will

8       say no one wants to raise fares on anybody. We

9       may not have a choice and we're acutely aware

10      that many of our customers are experiencing real

11      financial challenges and difficulties and no one

12      looks forward to that. Thank you, senator.

13                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you on

14      the assembly side, Assembly Member Steve Otis.

15                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEVEN OTIS:                           Hi,

16      Chairman Foye. Thank you and thank you for your

17      team and your hard work in this crisis. In your

18      opening testimony, you rightly said that the

19      survival of mass transit in New York State is at

20      stake here. But I think survival of mass transit

21      around the country is also at stake. And I'm

22      curious as to what information you have from your

23      colleagues in this industry running public

24      systems around the country are having and how are



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       they communicating with their representatives in

3       Washington to try and get us to a mass transit

4       solution out of the federal government and that

5       funding that we so desperately need?

6                   MR. FOYE:         So, Assembly Member Otis,

7       that's an excellent question. We've been in

8       regular contact with our colleagues across the

9       country. As a matter of fact, we organized two or

10      three webinars with colleagues from east and west

11      and north and south, red states and blue states.

12      We did one of those webinars together with

13      Senator Schumer and John Samuelson, the

14      international president of the TWU. We organized

15      others with leaders from Los Angeles, New

16      Orleans, Philadelphia, Austin, agencies all over

17      the country, again red states and blue states. We

18      work with APTA, which is the American Public

19      Transit Association, the trade association, if

20      you will.

21                  And we have been comparing notes with

22      our colleagues across the country in terms of the

23      latest in cleaning and disinfecting, customer

24      behavior, et cetera. And that input I think has



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       been helpful to us. And without being

3       institutionally modest, I think the MTA has led

4       the way on cleaning and disinfecting and frankly

5       advocacy. And I think each of us around the table

6       here, the MTA senior team has been involved in

7       that advocacy and working with our colleagues all

8       over the country.

9                  We've also enlisted the help of the

10      business community here in New York, the real

11      estate community here in New York. Obviously, our

12      labor partners, chambers of commerce of each of

13      the five boroughs and done calls, webinars et

14      cetera with business groups throughout the state.

15                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER OTIS:                   Thank you. And

16      you know, everyone in state government and

17      legislature and the governor, we're all pushing

18      as well. We need to get that federal money. There

19      really is no other solution.

20                 MR. FOYE:          Amen.

21                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Senate.

22                 SENATE COUNSEL:              Senator Anna Kaplan for

23      three minutes.

24                 SENATOR ANNA KAPLAN:                  Good morning,



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       chairman, and good morning, Chairman Foye. Thank

3       you so much for coming in today and testifying.

4       I'm sure you've seen the Citizens Budget

5       Commission Report, and yesterday's Newsday cover

6       story that was very critical of the MTA's plan to

7       add 776 positions and $50 million in overtime

8       during what perhaps is the worst fiscal crisis in

9       the agency's history, as you have mentioned this

10      morning. I share the same sentiment concerning

11      about the increase of payroll costs at a time

12      when we need to be delivering more for less.

13                 I'm certainly also very cautious and

14      very concerned about supporting any increase in

15      spending right now if it means we need to raise

16      fares on Long Island commuters. That is simply

17      not something we can bear right now. We need to

18      exhaust every alternative path before resorting

19      to fare hikes.

20                 So my question is can you explain why

21      this is a good decision right now and can you

22      explain to me why this is a good decision right

23      now, and can you explain to me the net impact of

24      the management headcount and the labor headcount



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       at the MTA as a result of this hiring?

3                  MR. FOYE:          Yeah, the short answer

4       senator, is that the newspaper report was wrong.

5       We are not planning to hire that number of

6       people. There's a hiring freeze in effect. The

7       MTA head count is over 2,000 people fewer than it

8       was a year or so ago. We are engaged in an effort

9       right now to eliminate a 1,000 management,

10      primarily management positions.

11                 With respect to the Long Island Rail

12      Road, we have deferred hiring for East Side

13      access. We had in the financial plan and in the

14      Long Island Rail Road budget, there were hires in

15      2020 and 2021, we have delayed those. So the

16      report of the CBC and the newspaper report were

17      inaccurate and we are very focused on reducing

18      headcount further.

19                 With respect to a fare increase, I agree

20      with you. Obviously, you know, Port Washington

21      and the area as well as I do. A lot of our

22      neighbors and friends in that area, including the

23      rest of Long Island and the rest of the MTA

24      region are suffering financially. A fare increase

2       is the last thing they need. It's also the last

3       thing that we want to do.

4                  SENATOR KAPLAN:              Thank you. I also share

5       the same sentiment that Senator Kaminsky talked

6       about. I have been still receiving a lot of e-

7       mails and calls from my constituents who take the

8       ride and are telling me that they feel

9       uncomfortable, because there are people who are

10      in the trains and not wearing masks and no one is

11      telling them anything.

12                 MR. FOYE:          Senator, I understand. Our

13      goal is to get to 100 percent mask compliance.

14      We're clearly not there. You know, as someone who

15      rides the Long Island Rail Road every weekday and

16      I'm in Penn Station in the morning and in the

17      evening. Mask compliance is high. It is not

18      universal and we're going to do everything we can

19      on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North and

20      subways and buses to get it as high as we can.

21      And that is an ongoing effort. But right, now

22      we're at a very high level.

23                 Public health officials report that at a

24      50 or 60 percent mask compliance level and we're

2       way above that on everyone of our agencies. There

3       are substantial public health benefits and the

4       mask message is one we will continue to drive

5       forward.

6                   SENATOR KAPLAN:              Thank you.

7                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. Our

8       next assembly speaker is Ron Kim.

9                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER RON KIM:                     Thank you,

10      Chairwoman Paulin and thank you Chair Foye and

11      your team for your testimony today. How many MTA

12      workers died from COVID-19?

13                  MR. FOYE:          One hundred and thirty-one.

14                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIM:                  One hundred and

15      thirty-one. And do you know how many workers were

16      infected from COVID?

17                  MR. FOYE:          Assembly member give me a

18      second and I'll come back to you with that. I

19      don't have it at my fingertips.

20                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIM:                  Okay. That's fine.

21      Even a rough ballpark of infection rate among the

22      workers would be helpful. Did the MTA conduct any

23      kind of contact tracing for those workers at the

24      time?

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2                  MR. FOYE:          Well, the answer is we're not

3       a public health agency or a hospital. Our office

4       of health services worked with hospitals and the

5       city and New York on contact tracing. Where

6       clusters were identified, employees were directed

7       to go home, to see their physician and to call

8       into OHS and that was the practice from the

9       earliest days of the pandemic.

10                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIM:                  Understood. Do we

11      have a better sense of what caused the spread and

12      infection rate? And the ultimate question is, are

13      we in a better place to provide PPE and prevent

14      the spread among the workers?

15                 MR. FOYE:          Well, assembly member, we

16      never had a shortage of PPE. I recited the

17      numbers in terms of millions of masks, millions

18      of pairs of gloves and hundreds of thousands of

19      gallons of disinfectant and hand sanitizer. We

20      are hoping there isn't a second wave, but if

21      there is a second wave we have sufficient

22      inventories of PPE for the present and for going

23      forward and orders from reputable suppliers for

24      all the PPE that we need including, being able to

2       provide it to customers. I ought to note that the

3       city and the state of New York have donated a

4       couple million masks to the MTA, both the city

5       and state for distribution to customers.

6                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIM:                  Thank you. Thank

7       you. Just to transition to the finances briefly,

8       I appreciate the external pressures that you're

9       putting on the federal government and rightfully,

10      you should be doing that until we get every cent

11      that we deserve from federal government.

12                 Have you looked into borrowing from the

13      Federal Reserve directly? And have you interacted

14      or had discussion within the Federal Reserve in

15      exploring the municipal liquidity facility which

16      was created for the first time this year to for

17      localities in the states to engage directly with

18      the fed?

19                 MR. FOYE:          So, assembly member, that's

20      an excellent question and I will ask our CFO to

21      tell you what we did last week.

22                 MR. BOB FORAN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,

23      METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY:                            Yes, last

24      week we borrowed $451 million from the municipal

2       liquidity facility at the Federal Reserve. We

3       received an attractive rate for a three-year

4       obligation of 1.92 percent. We did this in

5       conjunction with a competitive offering to the

6       bond market. Rates there came in significantly

7       higher and as we had arranged ahead of time with

8       the bidders and with the Federal Reserve, we

9       reserved the right to reject higher bids and go

10      directly to the Federal Reserve.

11                  So, again, we did borrow last week a

12      three-year obligation at 1.92 percent and saved

13      85 basis points, which over the three-year life

14      translates into almost $12 million of lower debt

15      service.

16                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIM:                  Thank you.

17                  MR. FORAN:           You're welcome.

18                  MR. FOYE:          Assembly member, I'll report

19      that 4,224 MTA employees across the agency tested

20      positive and more than 10,500 who were out in

21      quarantine have returned to work, which is great

22      news.

23                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

24      much. Senate.

2                  SENATE COUNSEL:              Senator Tom O'Mara for

3       three minutes.

4                  SENATOR TOM O'MARA:                 There we go. Good

5       morning Mr. Foye, thank you for testifying here

6       with us today. I do also want to commend you on

7       keeping the train on the track, so to speak,

8       during this pandemic and the amazing efforts that

9       have gone into making that happen from the

10      disinfecting the cars and providing PPE to

11      everybody. I do applaud your efforts. And I

12      certainly, as an upstate member of the

13      legislature, fully understand the importance of

14      the MTA to the New York City metropolitan region

15      as well as the economy of New York State as a

16      whole. In addition to the great jobs that we

17      generate from MTA contracts.

18                 And so I am supportive of and in urging

19      the federal congress to come together and provide

20      needed relief. I think we all need to keep in

21      mind that this money is not just sitting in the

22      bank any money that is going to come is borrowed

23      money. It adds to our debt, our national debt.

24      And we need to move forward as wisely as we can.

2       But I fully understand the need for assistance to

3       New York City MTA as well as I'm sure every

4       metropolitan transportation organization

5       throughout the country.

6                  With regards to the capital plan and

7       specifically the upstate manufacturers that

8       provide equipment services to the MTA, there has

9       been a pending MTA contract entitled R262 for

10      more rail cars, of which manufacturers in my

11      district are in play for, namely Alstom in

12      Hornell, who does great work. But also we have a

13      small Bombardier plant in Steuben County and CAF

14      in Chemung County. So these provide tremendous

15      jobs for these contracts.

16                 Can you tell me where your priorities

17      are in the capital plan right now as it's on

18      pause? What your priorities will be when you're

19      able to come out of the pause and where R262

20      stands in that process?

21                 MR. FOYE:          So, senator, let me start and

22      then I'll turn it over to Janno Lieber in a

23      second. First, thank you on behalf of the MTA

24      workforce for your kind words about the work

2       being done during the pandemic. We're very aware

3       of the importance of the MTA capital plan to the

4       entire State of New York, especially upstate

5       including senator in your district and Senator

6       Kennedy's district and obviously the North

7       Country et cetera. And we're very aware of the

8       concentration of rail car manufacturing or

9       fabrication in your district in particular.

10                   Obviously we're not going to talk about

11      pending procurement, but given that the fact that

12      the $51.5 billion capital plan is on pause right

13      now, that is not good for any manufacturer in the

14      State of New York or that does business for the

15      MTA, and is another critical reason why the

16      federal funding that I described is essential.

17      Janno.

18                   MR. LIEBER:           Just briefly, in response,

19      the capital program, the 2024 program which

20      includes those rail cars is on pause right now

21      because of the financial issues you have been

22      hearing about. That represents, the model that

23      you referred to, is about half of the rail car

24      procurement projected for subway car procurement



                                 Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
                 256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       projected for the 2020-24 capital program. So, if

3       we are able to resume it at some time, and it all

4       depends on federal funding, as we have said again

5       and again, but obviously that would be a

6       significant consideration if the capital program

7       is able ever to resume, if the problems are

8       worked out.

9                  In the meantime we are meeting with

10      Alstom, to get a sense of their plans for all of

11      their manufacturing facilities and their

12      manufacturing capacity, both the Alstom plants

13      you referred to, but also the Bombardier plants

14      that they're taking over as part of their

15      absorption of the Bombardier rail operation. So

16      we're using the time to become more educated on

17      that partnership, sir.

18                 SENATOR O'MARA:              Thank you.

19                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Senate? Oh,

20      Assembly, sorry. The next speaker on the Assembly

21      side is Phil Palmesano.

22                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHIL PALMESANO:                        Yes,

23      good morning. Good morning Mr. Chairman. Thank

24      you and Senator O'Mara covered some of the things

2       I might have talked about, given we're from the

3       same region in upstate New York and the

4       background we have with our upstate rail

5       manufacturers. So, a couple questions on a

6       different area though, if I could.

7                  One was more specific, if I could ask

8       this question, just out of curiosity. I know on

9       August 18th, the MTA announced that they're going

10      to be resuming front door entry to the buses

11      after five months of only having rear entry. And

12      I know you touched on this a little bit, but how

13      are you going to keep the bus drivers safe once

14      you start charging the fare and the passengers

15      who are currently entering in the back will be

16      entering in the front, where they don't have

17      interaction with the passengers. What steps will

18      be taken to make sure the bus drivers are safe?

19                 MR. FOYE:          I'm going to ask my colleague

20      Sarah Feinberg, president of the New York City

21      Transit.

22                 MS. SARAH FEINBERG, INTERIM PRESIDENT,

23      NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT:               Good morning, thank you

24      for the question. So, to answer your question,



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       I'm actually very proud of the New York City

3       transit bus team. They have come up with an

4       innovative barrier that is being installed on our

5       buses now. It is a hard plastic barrier that

6       basically separates the operator from riders who

7       will be boarding in the front of the bus. And

8       obviously those barriers take some time to

9       install. And so, in the meantime we have

10      temporary barriers that are in place between the

11      operator and the riders.

12                   And we've also taken a couple of

13      additional steps. We've moved the white line that

14      you may be familiar with that separates riders

15      from the operator back a bit as well, and

16      obviously continuing our disinfection program.

17                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER PALMESANO:                      Thank you. I

18      have one other question I wanted to ask. Does the

19      MTA currently have emergency preparedness plan

20      for natural disasters, pandemics, right now? Are

21      you required to have one or do you have one in

22      place?

23                   MR. FOYE:          Short answer, yes.

24                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER PALMESANO:                      And as far



                                 Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       as the protocols that went on with this pandemic,

3       so those plans that you implemented and followed

4       throughout this situation?

5                  MR. FOYE:          I would say we've followed,

6       implemented and supplemented them and changed and

7       ramped up as we went forward, especially as the

8       science changed. But there was a pandemic plan

9       that was done in 2017, if I recall correctly. The

10      other thing that we are doing as the infection

11      rate has declined in New York State, we're taking

12      advantage of the situation to put in place a plan

13      for a second wave, which we hope and pray does

14      not happen here in New York. But the answer is

15      yes. We have detailed plans on each of those

16      scenarios.

17                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PALMESANO:                      Thank you.

18      And then one quick question, if I may, I know in

19      the capital plan --

20                 MODERATOR:           I'm sorry assembly member

21      your time is up.

22                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Senate.

24      three minutes.

2                   SENATOR KENNEDY:              Senator Liu, we can't

3       hear you.

4                   SENATOR JOHN LIU:               All right thank you

5       very much to our co-chairs for holding this

6       hearing. Pat, thank you for the work you have

7       been doing. It certainly has not been easy. And

8       we faced severe deficits in city government and

9       state government and certainly looking for the

10      federal government to step up. Now, Pat, I'm just

11      trying to, I understand that the MTA needs help.

12      We all need the federal government to understand

13      that this pandemic is a national emergency that

14      requires a national response as we stated.

15                  But I'm trying to understand what you're

16      asking for, right. Because you've gotten already

17      $4 billion, not you the MTA has already gotten

18      $3.9 billion from the federal government in the

19      first act of CARES Act. And you're saying that

20      the MTA needs another $12 billion on top of that?

21      I mean the entire State of New York is facing a

22      revenue shortfall of 14 billion, the City of New

23      York depending who you're asking and when you're

24      asking, it ranges anywhere from three to $9



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       billion but the MTA needs another $12 billion?

3                  MR. FOYE:          Senator, short answer is yes.

4       To be clear, that's for the remainder of 2020 and

5       for the remainder of '21, and for the full year

6       21. The decline in tolls and fares, which is

7       about 50 percent of our revenue and the decline

8       in subsidies that the legislature has put in

9       place have been so dramatic and so precipitous,

10      but that's the amount that we need and Bob would

11      you add anything?

12                 MR. FORAN:           It's just that. That again,

13      because we're so heavily dependent here at the

14      MTA on fares and tolls, more so than any other

15      transit property, when you have such a

16      precipitous drop in ridership, it hits hard.

17                 SENATOR LIU:            This is a two-year -- so

18      the $12 billion is basically a two-year shortfall

19      is what you are saying?

20                 MR. FORAN:           That's right. And it --

21                 SENATOR LIU:            You're saying for the rest

22      of 2020 and 2021?

23                 MR. FORAN:           That is correct, sir.

24                 SENATOR LIU:            Are you saying that we're

2       not going to get back to normal before December

3       2021 or January 2022?

4                  MR. FORAN:           The projections --

5                  SENATOR LIU:            I mean that's what the $12

6       million will be on.

7                  MR. FORAN:           -- the projections that we

8       have, and these are based on studies that were

9       done by McKenzie in the springtime, updated in

10      June, that we are continuing to monitor, because

11      again, nobody knows what the projections really

12      will be. But they are projecting that toll

13      revenues will not get back to close to pre-

14      pandemic until the end of '22 and that fares will

15      not get back to close to pre-pandemic levels

16      until beyond the first quarter of 2023. And it's

17      projecting, and we're looking at it, that the

18      subsidies, dedicated taxes and such, will be weak

19      and below prior levels going into `23 and `24.

20      This is just an extended period.

21                 SENATOR LIU:            Okay. Well, I mean, I

22      don't know is McKenzie --

9                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    So I just want

10      to also announce that we've been joined by Yuh-

11      Line Niou. And we have no other assembly

12      speakers, so I will take the liberty to ask my

13      questions. The first question I have is the

14      payroll mobility tax obligation resolution to

15      establish a new bond credit, the PMT was

16      submitted to the CPRB earlier this year and

17      subsequently withdrawn. Would approval of this

18      resolution be helpful and how much money are we

19      talking about?

20                 MR. FORAN:           The Payroll Mobility Tax

21      Resolution, we believe will be a high quality

22      credit in the marketplace, a AA perhaps a very

23      strong AA, versus the transportation revenue bond

24      that we have now, which has been the workhorse

2       for years. It's what we call the fare box bonds.

3       That is what has been downgraded recently, now to

4       the Triple B plus level. Having a high quality

5       credit would be helpful for us and would reduce

6       costs significantly. We believe that it would

7       easily save us well over 1.5 percentage points.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. The

9       capital projects I know we spent time talking

10      about them. Is there any anticipation of moving

11      some of the 2024 capital projects into the

12      earlier plan and moving the others out, as we did

13      see for cars to LIRR, just for projects that are

14      safety oriented?

15                 MR. LIEBER:           Well, right now, what we

16      are doing is we have the capital, all of the

17      projects that are ongoing right now are moving

18      forward. And I want to convey to the committees

19      that we kept 500 projects going right through

20      COVID and many have been able to be delivered

21      early because of the additional access to track

22      and outages and so on. So we took advantage of

23      the time. Oh, yeah, very low infection rate of

24      our workforce, so that is a success story that we

2       can build on.

3                  But right now, what we're doing is we're

4       moving forward with the existing projects and the

5       only projects, chair that are going forward in

6       the '20 to '24 program is in-house work and

7       federally funded work, use it or lose it money

8       that comes from the feds. Otherwise, the

9       evaluation of how to re-jigger things and what

10      might be capital program amendments awaits the

11      resolution of our urgent ask for $12 billion.

12      That's really what we need to know before we

13      start to evaluate how we're going to delay or

14      adjust or retime projects. But the emphasis that

15      we're starting to focus on is making sure that we

16      maintain state of good repair and safety, to your

17      original point.

18                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. Next

19      question, the MTA's July financial plan doesn't

20      assume any reduction in subsidies from New York

21      City. How much revenue do we get from New York

22      City? And what's our risk there?

23                 MR. FORAN:           We received what we have in

24      the financial plan is $1.465 billion, so almost a



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       billion-and-a-half coming from the city. About

3       560 million of that is subsidies for MTA bus,

4       SIRTOA, and then also station maintenance. We

5       received a little over 500 million in 18B money,

6       the new internet marketplace sales tax and

7       paratransit subsidies. We receive about $385

8       million of urban tax, and then there's the school

9       aid and things like that, elderly subsidies.

10      Right now, we have no indication that the city is

11      not going to be providing the funds that we are

12      looking for.

13                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Do we

14      anticipate the lower estimate from some of the

15      tax based revenue?

16                 MR. FORAN:           Yes. We went through and

17      looked at our taxes, and so both taxes coming

18      from the state and taxes coming from the city

19      were part of our reduction through the McKenzie

20      report in lower revenues coming in.

21                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    And I do have

22      one last question. Judy griffin, who could not be

23      at the hearing, asked me to ask a question on her

24      behalf, so I'm going to do that. She has two and



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       I will -- the other, the first question that I

3       won't ask pertains to the 2012 or as you say now,

4       the 2017 former pandemic plans, I wonder if we

5       can get a copy of that, so she can see what that

6       look like. Her question relates to workers acting

7       as a guide to less populated cars. As some of the

8       other members indicate, I'm sure this is true on

9       the subways too. I'm more familiar with Metro-

10      North but the LIRR Metro-North, clearly from this

11      hearing and from my own experience are we have a

12      lot of riders concerned with masks and also

13      populated cars. So could there be an effort on

14      the part of the workers to help riders to move

15      and indicate where they might move to less

16      populated and perhaps more obliging mask wearing

17      ridership?

18                 MR. FOYE:          So, Chair Paulin, we will get

19      that document that your colleague requested. The

20      answer to her question is yes, and is actually an

21      app developed by the Long Island Rail Road which

22      indicates how crowded train cars are. It works

23      effectively. I check it most mornings. Metro-

24      North is working to develop one as well. And

2       Sarah, do you want to talk about buses for a

3       second?

4                  MS. FEINBERG:             Sure, we are, we have an

5       app that I'm blanking on the name of the tool

6       right now, but it's on, it replies to 40 percent

7       of our buses and for those riders who are

8       standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus and

9       trying to make a determination about which bus to

10      choose, we are providing information how busy and

11      how many riders are on that bus at what capacity

12      it's functioning at. So it's not everywhere yet.

13      We would love for it to be everywhere. And I

14      think it will be in the coming years if we can

15      get the money, and if the capital program can get

16      restarted. But eventually, that will give riders

17      all the information they need about the capacity

18      of the approaching, all of the approaching buses.

23      of Long Island, the Long Island Rail Road app is

7       remainder of their questioners.

8                  SENATOR O'MARA:              If I could interrupt?

9       This is Senator O'Mara. If I could interrupt for

10      one moment, my understanding is that Senator Mike

11      razz Ranzenhofer is in the waiting room trying to

12      get in for some time now. As the ranker on

13      corporations, I'd like some effort to be made to

14      get him into our group, please.

15                 SENATE COUNSEL:              Yes, Senator O'Mara,

16      our tech team is working with him, now. Thank

2       two questions and firstly, thank you commissioner

3       and all your staff that are participating in

4       today's hearing.

5                  Two questions, I have one of the busiest

6       train stations in the entire city of New York,

7       the Parkchester Train Station I believe is the

8       second busiest station after Yankee Stadium. I

9       have a large disabled population. And my first

10      question is I know we have some disability

11      funding and elevators and so forth making the

12      system more ADA accessible for a plan that goes

13      up to 2034, but I want to make sure whether that

14      plan is going to continue, what we're doing today

15      for people that are disabled to get access and be

16      able to enjoy the system. And then my second

17      question is what are the metrics established to

18      restart service after 1:00 o'clock in the morning

19      for the city?

20                 MR. LIEBER:           Janno Lieber of MTA

21      construction and development, senator. The 2020-

22      `24 program, which was approved at the beginning

23      of the year contains a historic commitment to

24      make 70 stations ADA accessible and with $5

2       billion for that purpose, it's literally double

3       all the money that has been spent to create ADA

4       accessibility in the MTA system since ADA was

5       passed, so it was a huge commitment.

6                  Unfortunately like everything we are

7       talking about in the new capital program, it's

8       being paused because of the uncertainty about

9       federal funding, the need for $12 billion in

10      federal funding to help solve our fiscal crisis.

11      That said, we have advanced aggressively, ADA

12      projects wherever possible. I've opened four new

13      stations just in the last month, completing work

14      there. We have 10 ADA stations in our

15      acceleration program. So we're really

16      prioritizing ADA within the constraints created

17      by this incredible fiscal crisis.

18                 MR. FOYE:          Senator, with respect to the

19      1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. closures, those were put

20      in place on May 6th, the closure was put in place

21      on May 6th to allow every subway station and

22      subway car to be disinfected. The closure has

23      played a key role in achieving those goals, and

24      as long as the pandemic continues the closure

2       will continue as well. And I believe you're all

3       aware that we've added a substantial, New York

4       City Transit has added a substantial amount of

5       additional bus service new routes included to

6       serve customers during that time period.

7                  SENATOR SEPULVEDA:                All right, thank you

8       so much.

9                  SENATE COUNSEL:              Senator Brad Hoylman

10      for three minutes.

11                 SENATOR HOYLMAN:               Thank you. Thank you

12      very much. Good to see you, chairman and your

13      colleagues. I completely appreciate the enormous

14      deficit that you're grappling with. I did want to

15      ask about should we have a change in a federal

16      administration in January, how quickly will

17      congestion pricing be online to help alleviate

18      some of that deficit? And how does it change your

19      forecast? I don't know if your $16 billion

20      deficit includes a plan for congestion pricing?

21                 MR. FOYE:          So, senator that's an

22      excellent question. I have to start with the

23      following obligation, right, which is that under

24      state law, the proceeds of central business



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       district tolling are dedicated to the capital

3       plan, Not only are they dedicated to the capital

4       plan, they comprise 30 percent of the funding in

5       $52 and-a-half billion capital plan.

6                  With respect to the question as to how

7       quickly could central business district tolling

8       be liberated from the hold in Washington, I

9       believe that could happen in a fairly short

10      period of time. The paradoxical observation I

11      would make is that congestion pricing is being

12      held purportedly for reasons having to do with an

13      environmental review process. And the reason it's

14      paradoxical to me is central business district

15      tolling congestion pricing, whichever term you

16      like, is a massive environmental good. It funds

17      mass transit. It reduces congestion, it improves

18      air quality. And it achieves goals that I think

19      it's fair to say everybody on this hearing today

20      believes in.

21                 SENATOR HOYLMAN:               So, could it be in

22      place next year?

23                 MR. FOYE:          I think next year is a

24      possibility, but certainly the hold that has

2       existed, senator, since April of 2019 when the

3       legislature passed it, we had our first meeting

4       some of you are aware, 10 or 14-days later, us

5       being me and a team from the MTA and Commissioner

6       Trottenberg and a team from New York City DOT and

7       certainly a new look at it would, I believe

8       accelerate the process greatly.

9                  SENATOR HOYLMAN:               Thank you. Second

10      quick question, which is your deep cleaning that

11      happens in your off hours. Are you changing your

12      strategy, given CDC guidance or perhaps your own

13      epidemiologists who are saying that transmission

14      on surfaces is less of a concern than as you say,

15      folks wearing masks? And will there be a cost

16      savings if you did not engage in deep cleaning

17      every night?

18                 MS. FEINBERG:             Hi, senator, it's Sarah

19      Feinberg. Good to see you.

20                 SENATOR HOYLMAN:               Nice to see you.

21                 MS. FEINBERG:             So, to answer your

22      question we have taken an all of the above

23      approach to cleaning. So we've certainly focused

24      on disinfecting the cars and stations multiple



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       times a day. But we've also, for months now,

3       taken this approach that we should be focused on

4       anything that could spread the virus. And so

5       we've been doing work with a pilot program with

6       UV technology that kills the virus. We've made

7       sure that we are focused on air filtration

8       systems and our air filters. So I am slightly

9       hesitant to suddenly take the CDC's word on the

10      fact that the virus is spread by aerosol as

11      opposed to touch points, because there's a lack

12      of trust at the moment. But that's why we've

13      focused on all of the above. So we want to make

14      sure that however the advice and the science

15      changes in the coming weeks and months, we've

16      been on it every way that we possibly can be.

17                 SENATOR HOYLMAN:               Thank you.

21      morning.

22                 MR. FOYE:          Good morning, senator.

23                 SENATOR RAMOS:              So I have several

24      questions, the first being I filed a FOIL request

2       on May 7th about the contracts awarded to private

3       contractors who are hiring more younger immigrant

4       workers to clean the MTA subways late at night.

5       Is the information available as to who these

6       private contracts are and what the contracts look

7       like?

8                   MR. FOYE:          So, senator I wasn't aware

9       you filed a FOIL. I don't think there's any

10      reason that we couldn't come back to you promptly

11      with the names of the contractors. I don't have

12      them at my fingertips and I don't think anybody

13      here in the room does.

14                  SENATOR RAMOS:              Okay. Thank you.           Bridge

15      and tunnel workers, I understand that over 150 of

16      them were reassigned to offer masks and escort

17      people off the subway for not wearing masks. Are

18      they being used? How is that working out?

19                  MR. FOYE:          Yeah, senator, bridge and

20      tunnel officers have been redeployed to the

21      subways to help with this distribution of masks.

22      I'm not aware that bridge and tunnel officers

23      have been escorting anybody off the subway. And

24      they have been supplementing the -- Sarah.

2                  MS. FEINBERG:             I didn't mean to

3       interrupt. I'm sorry.

4                  MR. FOYE:          Please.

5                  MS. FEINBERG:             I just meant I'll go

6       next. They're actually on our buses. I think they

7       have been in our subway system but they are on

8       our buses as well.

9                  SENATOR RAMOS:              Have any NYPD officers

10      been instructed to carry out the same task?

11                 MS. FEINBERG:             Well, we don't instruct

12      NYPD officers, so I would have to send you to the

13      city for that.

14                 SENATOR RAMOS:              Any other law

15      enforcement?

16                 MS. FEINBERG:             Well, we have MTA police

17      who are in the system and we also have security

18      contractors who are in the system. They're

19      generally offering masks to anyone who doesn't

20      have a mask available and suggesting that they go

21      to a booth or take a mask from the mask

22      dispensary that's on the bus.

23                 SENATOR RAMOS:              Okay. Thank you. Janno,

24      the last time we saw each other, you said you'd

2       take some steps to get rid of the premiums on

3       contracts, and like the most troublesome we have

4       heard from contractors being the one-sided

5       conflict resolutions. Have you taken steps to

6       remedy this issue?

7                  MR. LIBER:           Yes. Actually, the conflict

8       resolution provision that you are referring to

9       has actually been changed. And the standard forms

10      of contract have a third party resolution process

11      that doesn't keep, make the MTA the sole decision

12      maker which was something that created both

13      frustration and also cost escalation for

14      contracts. And we're doing a lot of things that I

15      am I've talked about to improve competition.

16                 SENATOR RAMOS:              All right, I need to

17      stop you because I have only a few seconds and I

18      have a question for Ms. Feinberg, which is what

19      are you doing to fix the broken machines to

20      refill the MTA cards? Are we going to fix them or

21      ask people to walk to the next station forever?

22                 MS. FEINBERG:             So, if you are referring

23      to the system wide outage that we had, I think

24      two weekends ago now, we've continued to



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       investigate why that happened. It seemed to have

3       happened after we did a software update and the

4       MVM machines across the system were out.

5                  More typically we have an outage because

6       we have a machine that's been vandalized that

7       happens dozens of times everyday but that's a one

8       off. Sometimes we have a machine that's down.

9       Again, it's a one off because it's a mechanical

10      failure. So this is a constant issue that we're

11      dealing with.

12                 SENATOR ROMAS:              Thank you.

13                 SENATE COUNSEL:              We have Senator

14      Gounardes does he wish to be recognized, please

17                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    I'm going to

18      say, we're not allowing second rounds.

19                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Yes, we are. Yes, we

20      are. And Senator, Ranzenhofer did he have any

21      questions, he's a ranker? Did he get in?

2       Ranzenhofer are you there? No? All right, Senator

3       Liu?

4                   SENATOR LIU:           I'm here. Thank you Mr.

6                   SENATOR COMRIE:             Senator Ranzenhofer,

7       okay, you there, do you have questions, senator?

8                   SENATOR MICHAEL RANZENHOFER:                          I do.

9                   SENATOR COMRIE:             You can go ahead now,

10      sir.

11                  SENATOR RANZENHOFER:                 Okay. Well, thank

12      you. Well, Mr. Foye listening to your testimony

13      and riding from Port Washington, you talk about

14      the rate of compliance with masks. I am very far

15      away from the MTA system but do talk to quite a

16      few people that live down there, and the constant

17      complaint that I have, as was talked about

18      Senator Kaminsky, is people that you want to ride

19      the mass transit system are simply not doing it

20      because they don't feel that the mask compliance

21      is adequate and they're not going to put

22      themselves at risk. So unless something is done

23      along those lines, you're going to continue to

24      have the problems that you have now. And that is



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       that people want to ride the system, or willing

3       to ride the system are not going to do it because

4       you're very lax in the way that the enforcement

5       of the mask policy is taking place.

6                   MR. FOYE:          So, senator, empirically, the

7       Long Island Rail Road team reports that mask

8       compliance among employees is universal and mask

9       compliance among customers is very high. Having

10      said that, because masks are so important, all

11      public health officials agree on that, A and B,

12      because it's the law of the State of New York as

13      a result of Governor Cuomo's executive order, we

14      are focused on increasing mask compliance.

15                  On the Long Island Rail Road, as at the

16      other agencies, masks are being distributed.

17      There are PPE vending machines in Penn Station,

18      for instance. And the Long Island Rail Road crews

19      have masks available to customers that don't have

20      them.

21                  And not empirically but anecdotally, my

22      experience on the Long Island Rail Road talking

23      to friends and colleagues, but more importantly,

24      talking to Phil Eng and his team at Long Island



                                Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
                256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       Rail Road, is that mask compliance, as it is on

3       subways and buses is very high.

4                  We are robustly and systemically and

5       repetitively messaging that on train

6       announcements, materials in stations, materials

7       on Long Island Rail Road trains and our goal is

8       to drive already high mask compliance to higher

9       levels.

10                 SENATOR RANZENHODER:                  I understand that

11      but, simply trying to do it and then successfully

12      doing it are two different things. I mean we also

13      know that you're not allowed to have large

14      gatherings and you hear reports from time to

15      time, of young people especially, getting

16      together in groups of 100, 200, 300, the law of

17      the state is not you are not allowed to do it,

18      you're not allowed to have mass gatherings, you

19      have to be wearing masks and people don't.

20                 The same applies to the mass transit

21      system. Simply because it's the law, and the

22      issue is really not with employees. The issue is

23      with fellow passengers just not abiding by it and

24      it makes people uncomfortable. So until you solve



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       that problem, notwithstanding the fact you may

3       have a high compliance rate, until it's better,

4       you're not going to increase the number of people

5       that feel comfortable riding your system.

6                  MR. FOYE:          Well, senator, our goal is to

7       drive it 100 percent. I would suggest that when

8       you talk to your friends and colleagues on Long

9       Island, one thing you may want to refer them to

10      is the Long Island train time app, which does

11      provide information on the number of passengers

12      on a particular car, which I think may be useful

13      information and obviously, there's

14      [unintelligible] [01:29:49] of self-help that can

15      be exercised here, which if you see a passenger

16      with a mask on the first train car it's possible

17      to move to the second and the Long Island Rail

18      Road train app gives our customers the data and

19      the power to do that.

20                 SENATOR RANZENHOFER:                  No, I understand

21      that and the people that I do talk to are using

22      that and they're moving again and they're moving

23      again and they're moving again and they're moving

24      again. And they don't like it. But, you know,

2       just reporting an observation of what I'm seeing

3       and hopefully you will take that under advisement

4       and hope to improve it even more than where you

5       right now. So, thank you very much.

6                   MR. FOYE:         Senator, thank you for the

7       comments. I can assure you that mask compliance

8       is a focus at every one of the agencies including

9       the Long Island Rail Road. They were already

10      high, we want to drive it higher and I thank you

11      for the comments.

2       All right, just continuing on my questioning from

3       the first round. This $12 billion request from

4       the federal government, again that's on top of

5       the $4 billion that the MTA has already gotten.

6       Still trying to understand where that number

7       comes from. There's been cites of 16 billion of

8       12 billion and also where the $2.7 billion in

9       extraordinary expenditures have gone to?

10                 MR. FORAN:           Well, first, in terms of the

11      $16 billion deficits that the chairman mentioned,

12      this year we're still projecting a $3.2 billion

13      deficit. Next year it is a $5.2 billion deficit.

14      It is a $3.8 billion deficit in 2022. The

15      projection is $1.8 billion deficit in 2023 and $2

16      billion deficit in 2024. That is over the period

17      between '20 and 2024.

18                 SENATOR LIU:            Bob, and that is after the

19      $3.9 billion have covered the current shortfall?

20                 MR. FORAN:           Yes, that's it. The $3.2

21      billion deficit is after we got the $3.9 billion

22      from the CARES Act. So, the 12 billion that we

23      now made the request for, that is the loss that

24      we suffered from the COVID pandemic from 2020-

2       2021. And it also includes the billion dollars

3       that we have not received that we expected to

4       receive in 2021 from congestion pricing.

5                  Remember that was supposed to go into

6       effect, beginning of 2021 and we are not

7       receiving that because of the inaction of

8       Washington in approving it.

9                  SENATOR LIU:            Look, I mean, I want the

10      MTA to get the full funding, I think we all do.

11      We also need the federal government again, for

12      city and state funding. But we also have to be

13      realistic about the MTA's numbers here, right.

14      You're basically saying the MTA has gotten $3.9

15      billion and is expecting another $3.5 billion of

16      deficit just on top of that just in 2020. That's

17      almost $8 billion of deficit, $7.5 billion of

18      deficit. And it's largely because people have

19      stopped riding the subways and buses. They

20      haven't been paying fares for months now, but the

21      total fare revenue for the entire year is only

22      about a little more than $6 billion.

23                 So I'm just not sure where the MTA's

24      coming up with the numbers. You also state that

2       there hasn't been a whole lot of hiring on top of

3       current workforce, there has been overtime, but

4       the overtime is in the tens of millions not

5       hundreds or even billions. So where do you get

6       the numbers from? And we need that. And

7       ultimately, the federal government needs to be

8       able to believe the numbers as well.

9                  MR. FORAN:           The numbers are the numbers.

10      They are in our financial plan.

11                 SENATOR LIU:            The numbers don't seem to

12      be the numbers.

13                 MR. FORAN:           Well, I'm sorry senator but

14      the numbers are the numbers. And again, we've

15      been discussing --

16                 SENATOR LIU:            How does the MTA get into

17      a $7.5 billion operating deficit just for this

18      year, when the total payroll costs, I'm sorry,

19      the total fare revenue is only $6 billion. Even

20      if you lost all of the revenue for this year,

21      which you haven't, it doesn't add up to $7.5

22      billion.

23                 MR. FORAN:           The amount of money that we

24      lost in terms of fares and tolls from the

2       pandemic $5.3 billion in 2020. That is the

3       projected loss this year. The subsidies that we

4       are projecting to lose of $1.7 billion, an

5       additional $750 million of costs we were

6       projecting. That's a total this year of $7.8

7       billion, 45 percent of our budget that we had in

8       February has either been lost or increased costs.

9       So that is striking. The $4 billion that we

10      received, 3.9 plus a little bit of change that

11      came in from another source, still left us with a

12      $3.8 billion hole created by the pandemic for

13      this year.

14                 We found some other money that we think

15      can reduce our deficit this year down to 3.2, but

16      when you look at next year we are still

17      projecting $3.9 billion in fare and toll losses,

18      almost $2 billion in subsidies, again, high

19      operating costs because of the pandemic, so about

20      $6.6 billion because of the pandemic.

21                 So, if you take the total losses caused

22      by this pandemic over just the two years, it was

23      $14.3 billion. That is 41 percent of the combined

24      two-year budget. That's staggering. So even with

2       the $3.94 billion that we received from CARES,

3       we're still in the hole because of this pandemic

4       $10.3 billion between '20 and '21. And that is

5       just for these two years. It doesn't include the

6       losses projected going out. So yes, they are

7       staggering, staggering numbers.

8                  SENATOR LIU:            Thank you. No one

9       questions that.

10                 SENATE COUNSEL:              Senator Tom O'Mara.

11                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Senator O'Mara I

12      believe is next.

13                 STATE COUNSEL:              For the final round.

14      This is the last senator.

15                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Senator O'Mara and then

16      Senator Rivera.

17                 SENATOR O'MARA:              Yeah, just turning on.

18      Thank you. Again, just following up on Senator

19      Liu's questioning, because that does raise a lot

20      of issues with me. I was under the impression

21      that the $12 billion was for this year. But

22      you're saying that goes out through 2021. The

23      numbers and the years you're talking about, is

24      that based on a calendar year? Or a fiscal year?

2                  MR. FOYE:          Senator, calendar year. We're

3       a calendar year company.

4                  SENATOR O'MARA:              With the pending

5       presidential election, and what could come with

6       significant changes both in the presidency, but

7       also in Congress, wouldn't it be making more

8       sense to making a request to get you through

9       January of 2021 and what would that number be?

10                 MR. FORAN:           We are losing about $200

11      million a week, okay. So we've got 17 weeks left

12      in this year. That roughly is about $3.4 billion

13      that we would need just to get us through the end

14      of this year. We don't have unlimited reserves.

15      We cannot continue to spend money unless we have

16      assurance that we're going to receive this

17      federal support. So that is why we are asking for

18      the $12 billion for this year and for next year

19      so that we don't run off a cliff beginning in

20      January.

21                 MR. FOYE:          Senator, additionally, our

22      board has to act at the November board meeting

23      with respect to the November financial plan,

24      which is in effect the budget for 2021 and

2       beyond. Our board is going to have to make

3       decisions based on the data available to them at

4       the time would be point one. Point two, given the

5       size and scale of the MTA and the fact that we're

6       losing $200 million a week, doing this on a month

7       by month basis I believe is unwise, and would put

8       a critical state agency at risk. I have no

9       visibility into the outcome of the Washington

10      elections at a national level or on a state by

11      state level, but that is not a risk it seems is

12      prudent for the MTA to take.

13                 SENATOR O'MAAR:              Well, I would, you

14      know, we have not seen anything from the federal

15      government that's been more than three or four

16      months at maximum. So I think it's unrealistic to

17      be thinking you're going to get you a figure that

18      is going to get you through 2021, certainly with

19      a lot of unknowns. We just simply don't know.

20      We're working on projections, and as we've all

21      seen projections around this pandemic have varied

22      widely and changed frequently.

23                 So you know, I think we should be making

24      more reasonable requests of the federal

2       government, since again, I'll say all this

3       funding is going to be added debt to the federal

4       government. They're not pulling it out of their

5       pocket, just as New York State doesn't have the

6       resources.

7                  The only benefit the federal government

8       has is frankly they can print money. But that

9       doesn't do our nation any good in the long run.

10      But I would just ask you to be a little more

11      finite in the requests you have for what we're

12      looking for. Maybe a little more realistic on

13      what we can hope to get. Thank you.

14                 Mr. FOYE:          Senator, I would make two

15      comments in response. One is, you're right the

16      pandemic has been unpredictable and has surprised

17      the nation and the world. I would note that most

18      of those unpredictable outcomes have been

19      negative and the virus is an unpredictable enemy.

20                 The other thing is being candid with

21      state legislators and policymakers, such as

22      yourselves, with elected officials, with our

23      customers and the federal government, we believe

24      the right thing to do is to ask for $12 billion

2       to get us through the remainder of the year and

3       into 2021. And I'm not aware of any state or

4       other agency that is making an ask on a month-by-

5       month basis and I don't think it would be wise. I

6       think it would be unwise for the MTA to do that.

7       But thank you for your comments.

9       have any other questioners.

13      much quicker than that. This is actually for Ms.

14      Feinberg. Thank you all for your testimony today.

15      I just have two quick questions. First, what is

16      the name of the app that is being used to track

17      how many people are on buses? Could you tell us

18      that again please.

19                  MS. FEINBERG:            It's the bus time tool in

20      our appl.

21                  SENATOR RIVERA:             The bus time tool. And

22      as far as the Bronx is concerned, were there

23      particular bus routes where that were assigned to

24      particular -- are there routes where this was

2       assigned specifically for in the Bronx? Or how

3       does it work as far as routes?

4                   MS. FEINBERG:            It's actually bus by bus,

5       not route by route but I'm happy to share

6       relevant information to you for your district.

7                   SENATOR RIVERA:             Got you. So don't have

8       them right now, what -- so it's regards, so buses

9       can go from route to route?

10                  MS. FEINBERG:            So the way we track this

11      information is through APPs which are on about 40

12      percent of our buses. And so I can't tell you off

13      the top of my head which buses they're on.

14                  SENATOR RIVERA:             Got you.

15                  MS. FEINBERG:            But we're happy to share

16      it with you and we're trying to put them on more

17      buses at all times.

18                  SENATOR RIVERA:             Okay. Just hoping that

19      is for high traffic areas, like Fordham Road,

20      places like that that have a lot of people in

21      them, obviously, it would be most useful in those

22      areas. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms.

5       for testifying today. We really appreciate your -

6       -

7                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Chairman, I haven't

8       asked my questions yet.

9                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Oh, sorry,

10      senator. Yeah.

11                 SENATOR COMRIE:              I appreciate that. But

12      I do want to thank the MTA for being here today.

13      And I appreciate you taking the questions from

14      the members, and we still have a lot of other

15      questions to ask you. Number one, just following

16      up on the question that Senator Kaplan asked

17      regarding the hiring in effect. Can you explain

18      how they got it wrong since in the July plan,

19      there was July financial plan, it still says that

20      you're hiring 776 people. And can you break that

21      down and explain to us exactly what that means?

22                 MR. FOYE:          Yeah, senator, the July

23      financial plan won't be formally amended until

24      November and we have hired fewer people than were

2       budgeted for and we are down 2,000 people,

3       compared to beginning of the year.

4                  SENATOR COMRIE:              So, in other words

5       you're saying that the hiring is not going to

6       happen and you don't need to fill any positions

7       at all at this particular time?

8                  MR. FOYE:          No, I'm not saying that,

9       senator. There are certain, for instance,

10      positions for bus operators that need to be

11      filled but we have a hiring freeze in effect,

12      except with respect to operating positions or

13      positions involving safety or public health. And

14      one of the disciplines that we have put in place

15      is to be rigorous in not hiring unless absolutely

16      necessary and that's why the number of actual

17      people on the payroll is down 2,000. And that

18      discipline is going to continue, and for example,

19      the assumption was that we'd be hiring for East

20      Side Access which will be completed in 2020 and

21      we have deferred that hiring and will continue to

22      defer it. To be clear, these are not construction

23      positions. These are Long Island Rail Road

24      positions that would be staffing the East Side

2       Access terminal when it opens.

3                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Okay. Thank you. And I

4       just want to continue to highlight the hiring and

5       actually the transparency piece. I want to

6       congratulate Sarah Feinberg on her realization

7       that there was not enough transparency, as far as

8       who has been working at the MTA and can you kind

9       of expound where we are on that? Have you been

10      able to discern and get the transparency, to

11      understand who is actually working there?

12                 MS. FEINBERG:             Good morning, senator. We

13      are well into our project of trying to develop a

14      tool that allows us to see all employees and all

15      of their contact information and their reporting

16      structure in real time. And the focus for this, I

17      think is, as we head into what could potentially

18      be another surge or a second wave of the

19      pandemic, the most important thing in my mind is

20      making sure that I can reach employees at,

21      whether it's their cell phone or their home to

22      let them know that they've been quarantined or

23      possibly exposed or be able to reach their family

24      members or ask them to get, you know, suggest

2       they get tested as quickly as possible. So we're

3       well into that.

4                  SENATOR COMRIE:              I was bringing that

5       actually around to the point of what their total

6       staff is and whether there can be redundancies

7       that are eliminated. You talked about saving $3.5

8       billion in internal savings. Can you go into

9       detail as to what that would be and where you

10      think that $3.5 billion will be coming from?

11                 MS. FEINBERG:             I'm happy to take the

12      question. I think you may also want to hear from

13      Chairman Foye, but I'm happy to start.

14                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Yes, this to everybody,

15      I'm sorry.

16                 MS. FEINBERG:             Okay. Got it. I don't

17      know how many savings we will be able to realize

18      just from the process of compiling all the

19      employee information, but undoubtedly there'll be

20      some savings there I'm sure. But inevitably, the

21      savings that we've compiled in our efforts to

22      bring savings to the table as every agency has

23      done, it mostly involves wear can we make

24      internal cuts, are there places where we were

2       getting by with something and we're going to have

3       to get by on less. So, overtime certainly is

4       something that we're looking at, real estate is

5       something we are looking at, office space.

6       Obviously, the last thing that we want to do is

7       get to a point where we are impacting service or

8       impacting our workforce.

9                  And so, I mean of the 3.5 billion in

10      internal cuts, I'm sure we're willing to share

11      more, but it's basically, as you can imagine,

12      cutting everywhere that you possibly can before

13      you get to layoffs, furloughs and service cuts.

14                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Well, we'd like to see

15      the details on that as soon as possible. I'm

16      going to just be respectful of time and ask a few

17      other questions in a bundle. I do want to get a

18      list of all the emergency contracts that have

19      been put out with COVID as the earlier senator

20      had asked, Senator Ramos, we wanted to find out

21      how these contracts were let and who they were

22      let to. I wanted to get an understanding if

23      there's been an update on the debarrment issue

24      that a lot of contractors were concerned about as

2       well. The issues of dealing with and how we ask

3       the federal government for money, Senator Liu and

4       Senator O'Mara brought up salient points about

5       what we actually need and now how we can be most

6       effective in getting that money. We would really

7       need to want to help you on that, but we need to

8       be clearer on that. It did not come out -- it was

9       very muddy today as to trying to figure that out.

10                 But my final question is and we have

11      other questions that we have to send you, the

12      capital plan, the current capital plan right now,

13      what are the, what's going to, you talked about

14      making sure the third track and other work is

15      being done. Can you give us the status where you

16      are with your current capital plan that has

17      already been funded and do you have all the money

18      to complete that plan?

19                 MR. LIEBER:           The projects that are

20      underway, the projects underway where there is --

21      there are contracts that have been committed to

22      and projects that have been committed to are

23      continuing with no slow down or hiccups. So the

24      key is if there is, and the vast majority of the



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       '15 to '19 program was committed to and was

3       underway before COVID hit.

4                  But there are some '15 to '19 capital

5       plan projects that were not committed to before

6       the COVID crisis hit and we have placed those

7       predominantly on pause, as well as the '20 to '24

8       program. The exception, as I said earlier is in-

9       house work where we use our own forces and we

10      have to pay them one way or the other, so we

11      should move that work forward. And federally

12      funded projects, which are we call use it or lose

13      it funds. Otherwise, everything is on hold that

14      hasn't been committed to.

15                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. And then

16      just an employee question, we've gotten

17      complaints from employees that they haven't been

18      able to get masks or PPE when they have asked for

19      it. Is there a process in place to ensure that

20      every person across the MTA system can get PPE

21      when they need it.

22                 MR. FOYE:          Yeah, senator, as I

23      mentioned, we have distributed since March 1st,

24      millions and millions of masks, well over eight

2       million pairs of gloves, disinfectant, hand

3       sanitizer.

4                  SENATOR COMRIE:              I heard that part, but

5       the question is if a person that shows up to work

6       and they don't have their equipment, can they get

7       equipment that day? Or is there a limit how much

8       equipment a person can get each week? Or how is

9       that breaking down?

10                 MS. FEINBERG:             Senator, I can take the

11      question as it pertains to transit. I mean we

12      have directed and asked of our employees anytime

13      that you show up at work and you feel like you do

14      not have adequate PPE, raise your hand, tell your

15      manager and you will get it.

16                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Will that work for the

17      Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road too?

18      Because we've gotten complaints from members, I'm

19      looking at, there's letters and testimony from

20      Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road. Is that

21      the same policy?

22                 MR. FOYE:          Yes, senator.

23                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Okay. Thank you. I know

24      I'm over time. I want to thank you all. We have

2       plenty of other questions that we want to submit.

3       We hope to hear more from you. I know that you

4       have a special hearing tomorrow before your

5       board, can you give us some kind of idea what you

6       are going to talk about tomorrow?

7                  MR. FOYE:          Yes, senator, I expect we'll

8       explore a lot of issues of these same issues as I

9       mentioned. No resolution will be put to the board

10      for action, no vote will be taken. It is a

11      further discussion of the A, the desperate need

12      for federal funding, $12 billion to cover losses

13      through the remainder of 2020 and the full year

14      2021 and actions that may have to be taken, which

15      I outlined earlier. No decision will be made. And

16      we'll be reporting, as Bob did today, on the

17      financial situation of the MTA.

18                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. To the

19      members or anybody watching, my cell phone died,

20      so if you're trying to text me right now, you

21      can't get through. But I just want to thank the

22      MTA for being here. And we still have a lot of

23      questions. I do have some concerns and some

24      disagreements with some of the statements

2       regarding the accessibility and I hope that we

3       can get all of that resolved, as far as we have

4       constituents that are complaining from the Long

5       Island Rail Road and the Metro-North that the

6       sanitizers are not available at the stations and

7       when you hit the machine a lot. I understand

8       there's a lot of challenges to making all this

9       happen and I hope that we can all work together

10      in the spirit of cooperation and outreach to make

11      that happen.

12                 I want to thank my co-chairs for this.

13      We do have other folks to hear from today, but I

14      wanted to just close out my end of the MTA, and

15      say I look forward to working with you to try to

16      get whatever we can from the federal government.

17      Hopefully there will be a federal government

18      that's more favorable next year, but we still to

19      have fight this year to get whatever we can

20      because the need is just that real. Thank you

21      very much. And I'll turn it over to my co-chairs

22      for final statements on the MTA. Thank you.

14      Utano. I'm the president of Transport Workers

15      Union Local 100, the union that moves New York.

16      We represent more than 46,000 workers in the

17      transport patient section, nearly 40,000 of these

18      workers operate, maintain and clean the city's

19      subway and bus systems for the MTA. We also

20      represent workers at private bus companies,

21      including Liberty Line Transit in Westchester

22      County, also at New York Waterway, the school bus

23      and tour bus industries.

24                 I want to thank the members of these

2       important committees for bringing the worker's

3       perspective to the issue at hand, the impact of

4       the pandemic on the MTA, including its workforce,

5       infrastructures and finances.

6                  Before I go any further, I would also

7       like to thank the members of these committees for

8       enacting the accidental death benefit legislation

9       for the beneficiaries of the essential public

10      sectors workers who lost their lives to COVID-19.

11      This sent a powerful message to those who are

12      carrying the fight against this disease that you

13      have their backs.

14                 As I stated in official announcement of

15      this hearing at this time, as I state, 131 MTA

16      workers have died of the virus. The majority of

17      them were members of the TW local 100, the

18      remainder were members of the Amalgamated Transit

19      Union and other unions. No one at New York City

20      transit was immune. But these are just numbers

21      and they don't tell the story of who these

22      wonderful people were, the vital jobs they did in

23      the fight against this pandemic and, of course,

24      the important lives they lived outside of their

2       jobs as transit workers.

3                  Some were relatively new to the job and

4       some had more than 35 years of service. They were

5       from every department and transit, buses,

6       subways, stations, car equipment, bus

7       maintenance, cleaners, track workers, single

8       structures and power, almost all were loving

9       parents and heads of household.

10                 One was an immigrant from the Dominican

11      Republic who served his adoptive country in the

12      United States army. He was just 41 years old and

13      left a grieving wife and young son. Another was

14      an Egyptian, an immigrant from Egypt who had

15      worked in the oilfields of Saudi Arabia. After

16      his expenses, he sent every dime he made back to

17      his wife and three children in Egypt. It was his

18      dream to bring them all to America. One was an

19      author of popular fast-paced fiction novels,

20      another was a deep sea diver, another a beloved

21      pastors of an AME church in Brooklyn. And yet

22      another was so beloved by his passengers in the

23      Bronx that some burst into tears when they were

24      told their favorite bus operator had died of

2       coronavirus.

3                  Three of our lost brothers were elected

4       officers of local 100, who got sick while

5       representing their coworkers in the subways. Many

6       other union officers got sick as well, but were

7       lucky enough to survive. One of them is here with

8       me today. He's elected chair of a major division

9       within local 100. He's Robert Kelley, the chair

10      of station division, which represents thousands

11      of station agents, collectors, railroad stock

12      workers, way finders and cleaners. I would ask

13      that he be given the opportunity to say a few

14      words after I'm done with this testimony.

15                 It is truly hard to describe the loss

16      felt by the families and by the coworkers left

17      behind in the depots, in the shops, in the barns

18      and in the crew quarters. Yet transit workers did

19      their jobs every day, 24 hours a day, seven days

20      a week during the darkest hours of the pandemic.

21      They continue to do it today as the dangers have

22      subsided, but still remain ever present.

23                 There is much blame to go around for

24      what has happened to us here in New York and

2       across the country. We see the blame game playing

3       out every day in the media. It is the central

4       debate of the presidential race. It is my opinion

5       that no one was ready for this crisis, not

6       Washington, not Albany, not city hall, and

7       certainly not the MTA.

8                  The MTA's response in the first days of

9       the crisis was to dust off an eight-year-old

10      pandemic operating plan written after the Ebola

11      scare of 2012. And by the way, I just want to

12      make a note that I now just learned they have a

13      2017 pandemic plan that I have never seen and was

14      never involved in putting together.

15                 However, the fact that this union had to

16      threaten service unless bus operators and

17      conductors who wanted to wear their own masks

18      were allowed to do so reveals the depth of the

19      lack of understanding of what was happening in

20      our country. We fought for every change possible

21      in operating safety to mitigate transmission of

22      the disease in those first critical weeks,

23      including indefinite suspension of the Kronos

24      fingerprint time keeping system, rear door

2       boarding and restricting rider areas for buses,

3       cashless transactions in stations, daily

4       disinfection of work areas and rolling stock,

5       sufficient supplies of masks and hand sanitizer

6       and optional face masks for conductors, a system

7       wide policy that riders be required to wear masks

8       to get on a bus or train.

9                  We also fought hard for the surviving

10      family members. We were successful in negotiating

11      benefits for families of our fallen heroes. This

12      is a $500,000 benefit. It will not bring back

13      their loved ones, but hopefully it will allow

14      them to rebuild their shattered lives.

15                 I believe that our efforts in the media

16      outreach forced the MTA and the City and State to

17      take notice of the crisis of the homeless and

18      mentally ill inhabiting the subways on the

19      overnights, making it difficult to do our jobs

20      and increasing the risk of assaults and virus

21      transmissions.

22                 When the MTA ends its temporary

23      suspension of overnight subway service for

24      cleaning, strong enforcement is needed to prevent

2       the homeless from squatting in the system again.

3       The threat to transit workers and passengers from

4       the pandemic is far from over. A second outbreak

5       is a serious risk, as schools are set to reopen

6       and the city continues to expand its reopening

7       plans.

8                    We want the MTA and the state

9       legislature to commit to the following. No

10      layoffs, regardless of the financial concerns,

11      layoffs are front of frontline workers cannot be

12      tolerated. Transit workers are essential

13      workforce. We face the dangers and paid dearly in

14      death and illness for that responsibility. To now

15      be told that our jobs may be expendable because

16      of a financial shortfall is unacceptable. And,

17      quite frankly, a break in a vital trust that

18      keeps us coming back to work no matter what the

19      risks. There is no talk of police layoffs,

20      firefighter or healthcare. We ask this committee

21      to adopt a statement underscoring our position on

22      this matter, no layoffs no matter what.

23                   Enforcement of mask policy, the MTA, the

24      MTA police, and the transit police must strictly

2       enforce the mask requirement policy. This issue

3       has led to disputes on buses and trains and has

4       caused new concerns of assaults on the workforce

5       and passengers.

6                   The MTA claims the mask requirement is

7       being honored by as many as 90 percent of the

8       riders. However, our Local 100 safety teams have

9       monitored a number of bus routes in Brooklyn and

10      Manhattan where as much as 40 percent of the

11      passengers boarded without masks. This is

12      unacceptable. The MTA needs to expand its pilot

13      program of mask dispensing machines to buses and

14      stations across the system. We want the MTA to

15      produce regular reports on the mask mandate,

16      including the effectiveness or the lack of

17      effectiveness of their enforcement policy.

18      Workers and riders must feel the system is safe.

19      Everyone wearing a mask is a vital part of that

20      equation.

21                  Bus shields and safe space in the

22      subway. Bus operators, train operators and

23      conductors are the most vulnerable of the transit

24      workforce. Their exposure to the public is

2       constant. Bus operators encounter hundreds of

3       riders every day. The subway, a single train, is

4       capable of holding more than 1,000 passengers. On

5       the buses the shower curtains are unpopular

6       amongst operators and viewed as ineffective. We

7       are seeking the full compartment approach for the

8       operators that some agencies in Europe and in a

9       few American cities have already adopted. A

10      permanent solution of the bus shield issue must

11      be accelerated.

12                 In the subway, we want a free space or

13      no entry zone established around the crew cabs to

14      improve social distancing for our train operators

15      and conductor.

16                 Testing, we ask for regular and rolling

17      testing of percentage of workforce to weed out

18      infected workers without symptoms to quarantine

19      for the proper time. The military academies,

20      including West Point, Air Force, [unintelligible]

21      [02:07:30]      testing students like this. We are at

22      war against this disease. We must use every

23      weapon at our disposal.

2       wrap up? Your time has passed.

3                   MR. UTANO:          Okay. I'm almost done. The

4       depth of the loss among the workforce demands

5       that the MTA adopt the strictest and most

6       comprehensive testing measures to avoid a second

7       pandemic.

8                   Research, Local 100 has entered into a

9       partnership with the New York University School

10      of Public Health in a comprehensive study on why

11      transit workforce was the hardest hit segment of

12      all essential workers. We launched the study

13      earlier this month. We ask that these committee

14      go on the record in supportive this study and to

15      urge the MTA to cooperate fully with all New York

16      NYU requests including medical records. I'm

17      almost done, one more.

18                  Hazard pay, Local 100 and the ATU have

19      launched a multi-tier campaign to win hazard pay

20      for transit workers. Maybe you have heard one of

21      our video commercials. We believe that essential

22      workers have earned this pay. We believe that in

23      the event of a second outbreak, workers will be

24      far less ready to risk their health and family's

2       health without an incentive like hazard pay.

3                  We seek commitment from the MTA that

4       when they receive new funding from federal

5       government, a portion that of money be set aside

6       for the workers in the form of hazard pay. Thank

7       you. I now would ask if Robert Kelley could be

8       given an opportunity to speak, and then we'll be

9       available for questions.

10                 MR. ROBERT KELLEY, CHAIRMAN, STATIONS

11      DEPARTMENT TRANSPORT WORKERS LOCAL 100:                           Thank

12      you, President Utano, thank you very much. Thank

13      you, senators. Thank you, assemblyman,

17      have to express that.

2       misinformed about wearing masks, refused PPE

3       prior to the many deaths. To sit up here today

4       and to listen to Chairman Foye say that all along

5       we've had this PPE in storage somewhere and not

6       afford us the opportunity to use them, well,

7       quite frankly, is appalling, to say the very

8       least.

9                    I myself was plagued with this virus. I

10      spent three weeks in the hospital. I was out

11      there on the frontline trying to make sure that I

12      could secure the safety my members. In doing so,

13      I took ill. While I was on my bed with two feet

14      in the mud, thank God for family and friends and

15      my brothers and sisters from the union that gave

16      me that will to continue to fight and fight

17      through it, I was one of the few that survived in

18      that respect, that was in my condition, but I'm

19      here today to testify and to make sure we have a

20      clear, concise understanding that the MTA cannot

21      continue to act in the manner in which they did

22      in the past and to try to sweep things under the

23      rug like it doesn't matter.

24                   We was definitely not treated fairly.

2       Going forward, I hope and pray that you guys see

3       what's been happening to us and why we have so

4       many lawsuits that could have been prevented had

5       the MTA done their due diligence, which was to

6       keep their works force safe, and they failed to

7       do so.

8                    In reference to the shutdown from 1:00

9       to 5:00, we have more than enough adequate

10      clearance that can fulfill the obligation. We do

11      it on a daily basis. We clean, high pressure

12      hoses all day long around the ridership and we do

13      it very well. We've been doing it for years, so

14      we can continue to do that. So the 1:00 to 5:00

15      shutdown is ridiculous, we're losing money there,

16      we need the money.

17                   As far as our booths go, we can't assist

18      the ridership because we don't have money in the

19      booth. Now, we know we want to safeguard our

20      members and that is the first thing. First of

21      all, I want safety first, but there are ways and

22      methods that we can use to bring money back into

23      the booth. We understand Omni is coming, but it's

24      not here yet. We do have an agreement that we are

2       supposed to continue to act the way we have in

3       the past so that we can move forward with the

4       Omni. The Omni is coming before its time and I

5       feel it's being forced upon us, and I feel like

6       it's doing a terrible injustice to the ridership,

7       and especially our pockets. We're losing millions

8       of dollars by not having money in these booths.

2       hearing. This COVID-19 pandemic has posed

3       challenges and risk that are clearly

4       unprecedented. I'd like to pay my deepest

5       respects to hundreds of MTA families who have

6       lost loved ones to this vicious virus and convey

7       my sincere appreciation to the thousands of

8       frontline workers who came to work and continue

9       to work each and every day, putting themselves

10      and their families at risk of contracting COVID-

11      19.

12                 I would like to start by saying that I

13      am not attempting to place any blame, but I am

14      obligated to raise issues where there were

15      inconsistencies and flawed practices that

16      continued throughout the pandemic and in some

17      cases remain today.

18                 For example, there were inconsistencies

19      with using masks and the ability to stock and

20      issue PPE and the proper sanitizing cleaners and

21      wipes was a tremendous challenge, which

22      inevitably caused tremendous trust issues for our

23      frontline workers. The agency would publically

24      announce the issuance of PPE and cleaning

2       supplies when these products were not making it

3       to our employees until days or weeks after the

4       announcements. That should never have happened.

5                  MTA leadership repeatedly referred to

6       our workforce as heroes moving heroes, but I am

7       not sure those words will cut it as we continue

8       to battle this virus and attempt to rebound from

9       the financial burdens we face. Our workforce has

10      been challenged, but they have answered the call

11      by delivering on essential service and projects

12      while prioritizing the safety of our riders.

13                 I would like to speak about what our

14      organization perceives to be a disconnect between

15      the MTA headquarters and the agencies. As you

16      should know, I represent Long Island Rail Road

17      workers and can only speak on our experiences.

18      The safety and occupational health services

19      policies and procedures made at headquarters were

22      Island. Blanket procedures in dealing with COVID

23      did not address all of the individual crafts

3       frontline field workers created constant

4       confusion and impossible distancing scenarios for

5       our unions to navigate. Precautions and

6       procedures need to be craft specifics.

7                  Additionally, those who create the

8       policies need to be much more aware of what the

9       craft positions do if they want realistic

10      measures to be taken. The unions need to be much

11      more involved.

12                 Next, would I like to recognize the

13      efforts of the medical and HR staff on the Long

14      Island Rail Road who assisted in dealing with the

15      tracking and quarantining of our employees.

16      Unfortunately, to no clear fault of these

17      individuals, there were mistakes and

18      inconsistencies. Workers were calling to ask if

19      they should go to work or not due to potential

20      exposure, only to be told someone would get back

21      to them in a day or so. People came to work that

22      should not have. It was difficult to navigate

23      with limited resources that I know. But we need

24      to do better. Workers pay status is relative to

2       quarantine and how revised rules required

3       additional paperwork were and remain difficult to

4       navigate. Medical clearance requirements and

5       follow-up testing locations varied and changed

6       throughout the last several months.

7                  The bottom line is nothing seemed to be

8       clear to provide the needed support to our

9       frontline workers and constantly changed. Again,

10      messages from headquarters were not in the sync

11      and consistent with the company. It just seemed

12      that everything was generated from the

13      headquarters, yet the Long Island Rail Road was

14      either unaware or unable to communicate where the

15      challenges were. There needs to be more controls

16      implemented within the individual agencies and

17      more awareness of what is happening on the

18      property, and that will lead to my next concern.

19                 Managers cannot be aware of what our

20      employees need on the frontlines if they are not

21      there. Every member of our organization was a

22      true essential worker, and I add the word true in

23      front of the essential worker for a reason. They

24      were mandated to come to work and physically were

2       on the property to perform their services. They

3       moved trains. They cleaned, they sanitized,

4       repaired, built infrastructure and more while on

5       the property and at risk each and every day. This

6       is true essential work.

7                   The large amount the management

8       positions however, were or still are working from

9       home remotely or working alternating days and in

10      safe distance locations. I understand the

11      principles behind this decision, but in my

12      opinion, more managers should be out supporting

13      our rank and file workers in the field, not at

14      home. They should have been out supporting our

15      workers, issuing PPE and checking worker

16      wellness.

17                  At a time when the MTA has some very

18      difficult decisions ahead of them to reduce

19      expenses, I can assure you that I and other union

20      leaders will take great exception to any true

21      essential worker positions being cut. They were

22      needed and put to risk throughout this entire

23      pandemic and should be secure into the future. By

24      establishing remote working alternating days and

2       varying safe options for the managers, it has

3       clearly identified where the future savings can

4       be found. Labor is advocating for funding as

5       well. We know how much we need the financial

6       support, but the money needs to be prioritized

7       properly and spent on essential workers. We

8       cannot spend federal money on consultants,

9       studies and unnecessary senior management

10      positions.

11                 In closing, I would like to say I

12      appreciate the efforts of every MTA employee

13      through this COVID crisis, while prioritizing a

14      well-deserved appreciation to the true essential

15      workers on the frontlines. We have all learned a

16      great deal and need the work together at doing

17      better. I thank this committee and for all those

18      who will take active steps in improving on the

19      challenges we have and are facing. I wish nothing

20      but good health and progress to all of us in a

21      society that has certainly been through a great

22      deal. Thank you for this opportunity, and I will

9       both of you, so sure.

10                 MR. VALENTE:            Okay. Good afternoon,

18      and as general chairman, I'm here today on behalf

19      of approximately 1,600 members of the Association

20      of Commuter Rail Employees.

21                 Created in January 2000, ACRE represents

22      essential operating craft employees at the MTA

2       controllers, signalmen, yardmasters and

3       stationmasters under one labor organization.

4                  ACRE works with the MTA and Metro-North

5       management to build and operate what is

6       universally recognized as the premiere commuter

7       railroad in America. Our members are essential

8       workers. Throughout even the worse weeks of the

9       pandemic ACRE members continued to heed the call

10      at great personal risk in order to ensure that

11      first responders and healthcare professionals had

12      the transportation required to fight back against

13      the pandemic.

14                 We thank your committees for the

15      opportunity to testify at this important hearing

16      on the impacts of COVID-19 and our work. ACRE is

17      highly concerned for the safety of both our

18      members and passengers who are facing increased

19      exposure to COVID-19 in correlation to an

20      increase in Metro-North ridership as the regional

21      economy moves further and further into reopening.

22                 And despite similar claims from Metro-

23      North, the railroad has taken few measures to

24      match their words. To that end, it is our

2       priority that Metro-North restores full service

3       as already implemented at New York City Transit

4       and LIRR. This is only way to provide the right

5       balance of services to allow passengers and

6       workers alike to socially distance. And failure

7       to do so can arguably result in greater

8       difficulty for passengers to socially spread.

9                  Despite the fact that it is no longer

10      possible to socially distance once the train cars

11      start filling up, while Metro-North is increasing

12      peak hours service commencing August 31st, the

13      agency has consistently refused to acknowledge

14      the need to go to a full service schedule for off

15      peak and weekends.

16                 And within individual trains themselves,

17      more steps should be taken to mitigate the risk

18      factors that contribute to the spread of the

19      virus. For example, Long Island Rail Road has

20      introduced a smart phone app that indicates to

21      passengers, which cars have more available space

22      to spread out. Metro-North has not. And Metro-

23      North has yet to make hand sanitizer widely

24      available on trains. What sanitizer stations are

2       available are rarely filled. And what sanitizer

3       is available the in bathrooms isn't alcohol-

4       based, making it a much less effective disinfect.

5                  While having worked hard and sacrificed

6       to overcome the spread of COVID-19, our region

7       can ultimately only control the virus so much. By

8       not providing an adequate environment for

9       passengers to socially distance, risk will remain

10      exacerbated and potential passengers will opt not

11      to ride on Metro-North.

12                 Thus it is critical that Metro-North

13      cease with the distractions and accept its

14      responsibility to create the best safety scenario

15      possible to protect workers and passengers alike.

16      On August 1st, a female conductor was brutal

17      assaulted by a male passenger while working her

18      train. She was punched approximately 30 times and

19      suffered a concussion, bruised jaw, lacerations

20      inside of her mouth, bruises on her head, arm and

21      shoulders, swollen eye that may include further

22      damage and extensive emotional trauma.

23                 Such violence against ACRE members is

24      both alarming and now unsurprising. There is

2       almost no police on Metro-North trains. In

3       addition to exposure to COVID-19, many of our

4       members remain persistently at risk of assault by

5       members of the public while on the job.

6                  On this front, ACRE has engaged with

7       Metro-North for months in pursuit of securing a

8       proper police presence on the trains and adequate

9       benefits for victims of on duty assaults. Now, to

10      make matters worse our members are at a

11      heightened risk of assault for simply trying to

12      enforce social distancing and mask wearing

13      requirements on the trains during this pandemic.

14                 Metro-North needs to maintain a regular

15      police presence on our trains. It would deter

16      violent crime as well as verbal abuse,

17      [unintelligible] [02:23:04], terrorist activity

18      and theft. A police officer is better situated,

19      unlike our conductors, to enforce compliance with

20      the mask requirement. With such a force, we are

21      confident that passengers and crew members will

22      feel greater security in their commute, as

23      criminals will think twice before engaging in

24      violence or theft.

2                  In addition, Metro-North must adequately

3       compensate workers who are the victims these on

4       duty assaults. As it is stands, the railroad

5       requires to use their own accrued sick leave to

6       recover from on-duty assaults. Rather than

7       penalizing the worker for the railroad's lack of

8       security, Metro-North should be liable for the

9       medical costs and leave that is attributable to

10      the on duty assault. ACRE strongly supports

11      legislation introduced by Chairman Comrie, which

12      would codify such an obligation into statute.

13                 Finally, it is important to mention the

14      lack of accommodations for pregnancy at the MTA

15      and Metro-North. In addition to the immediate

16      viral threats the of the COVID-19 pandemic, the

17      duties of ACRE members are strenuous, carrying

18      heavy equipment, climbing up and down equipment,

19      throwing hand switches, locking down pantographs,

20      and all while these workers are constantly on

21      their feet. New York has has long recognized

22      disability caused by or in connection with

23      pregnancy for receiving workman's comp.

2       workman's compensation, as a a matter of

3       principle pregnant workers need to be treated

4       fairly on the railroad too. Anything short is

5       discrimination. The MTA Metro-North must

6       implement a functional system where an expecting

7       Metro-North worker is not forced to risk life or

8       injury to themselves or their baby as a condition

9       of employment. This includes providing adequate

10      PPE and enforcing social distancing and mask

11      requirements to the best of the railroad's

12      abilities, as well as accommodations, light duty

13      or time off if determined medically necessary by

14      the worker's doctor.

15                 The MTA announced the task force in July

16      to review poor accommodations for pregnant New

17      York City transit workers after a tragic and

18      entirely avoidable miscarriage. There have been

19      no updates since. ACRE requests that the

20      committees here use your oversight authority to

21      ensure the MTA does not let this important

22      obligation to its workers fall by the wayside.

23                 ACRE is committed to protecting the

2       Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1179. I'm Jose

3       DeJesus, president and business agent of the

4       local. While these hearings focus on the MTA,

5       what I highlight applies to all transit workers

6       on the frontlines fighting against COVID-19. This

7       includes the members of ATU Local 1179 in Queens,

8       Local 726 in Staten Island, Local 1056 in Queens

9       and also Local 1181 in Brooklyn and the riding

10      public.

11                 Local 1179 members operate and maintain

12      MTA bus routes serving Queens, some routes

13      extending into Brooklyn and Manhattan. ATU

14      members are working under an expired contract

15      that the MTA refuses to update. The MTA already

16      settled a new contract, including mew wages for

17      the workers represented by TW Local 100. This

18      creates two classes of workers paid differently

19      to perform the same work.

20                 Many of the legislator present today and

21      others flagged this inequity to the MTA, and we

22      thank you. The MTA recognizes -- excuse me. The

23      ATU recognizes, as do most experts, that without

24      a fully functioning transit system, we cannot

2       expect New York City and other, and thus our

3       state and national economy to fully recover and

4       achieve growth beyond. That includes treating all

5       workers fairly and equitable and all that perform

6       the same work must receive the same pay and not

7       be treated as part of some caste. ATU workers

8       deserve a contract for the same work as the MTA

9       already settled and refuses to discuss with ATU.

10                 Our members are classified as essential

11      employees and continue to work in order to make

12      sure our essential workers, including doctors,

13      nurses, police, grocery store clerks and others

14      can get to their jobs and return home to their

15      families. The work of our members has put them at

16      increased risk of exposure of the coronavirus.

17                 This exposure has not been without

18      consequences. In New York, ATU has lost 33 of our

19      brothers and sisters to COVID. They put their

20      lives on the line as essential workers during

21      this crisis, and our membership performed their

22      jobs in exemplary manner, despite the MTA

23      treating them as a second class worker without

24      the same compensation afforded to our brothers

2       and sisters at Local 100, working at the MTA

3       under a new contract. Transit workers are unable

4       to shelter in place. We are required in a

5       workplace that requires the minimum at home

6       shelter or better shelter as the workplace.

7                  Transit workers are exposed to all

8       dangers and still have shown great resiliency

9       mentally and physically under certain conditions

10      despite the MTA treating themes a second class

12      our brothers and sisters at Local 100 and working

13      at the MTA under a new contract.

14                 The priority of the ATU has been to

15      protect the health and safety of our members who

16      are essential workers on the frontlines of this

17      crisis. And at the start of this crisis, our

18      members were put in harm's way without the proper

19      protection. Our workers were not given the

20      personal protection equipment, PPE such as masks,

21      gloves and cleaning supplies necessary to prevent

22      transmission of this virus. It was their union

23      that supplied those basic mandatory items, while

24      other members better but limited access to PPE

2       now, delay in getting equipment was too

3       insufficient.

4                  We must ensure that the MTA has access

5       to supplies and PPE equipment to its workers on

6       the frontlines. We must also ensure that is MTA

7       sets mandatory standards for PPE for transit

8       workers and for the cleaning of buses and transit

9       stations. These standards need not to only apply

10      to the situation today, but also apply going

11      forward, so we are not ill prepared for the

12      situation like this in the future.

13                 Our members continue to put themselves

14      at risk while the MTA treats them as a second

15      class worker without the same compensation

16      afforded to our brothers and sisters at local

17      100, working at the MTA under a new contract. In

18      addition to the PPE, the MTA must put in place

19      protections to guarantee the safety of our

20      members.

21                 The MTA needs to equip buses with

22      functional sheeting or Plexiglas barriers to

23      reflect the spread of the virus and must ensure

24      proper ventilation on its equipment, including

2       buses and all work spaces. We need the highest

3       available MERV filters. We need protections from

4       our drivers, explore offsite fare boxes to

5       minimize drivers' contact with passengers and

6       speed up the time line on implementing the Omni

7       system.

8                  Our depots, some built in the early

9       1900s, need upgrading, including eight track

10      systems to improve the social distancing, explore

11      a remote clock-in and clock-out system for our

12      workers as they report to work. We must also

13      closely explore the airflow on buses and adjust

14      design of current upcoming fleets needed. Air in

15      buses recycles in the cabin and then flows to the

16      front, potentially carrying bacteria and viruses

17      with it. We must work to ensure updated

18      ventilation and air control systems on our buses

19      that meet the appropriate air standards to ensure

20      the health and safety our drivers and passengers.

21      Our transit workers suffer from pulmonary

22      diseases at the rate of 70 percent or higher than

23      the general public.

24                 This remains all the more important as

2       fare collections of all MTA buses resumes next

3       week on the 31st. And the MTA still refuses to

4       treat our members as anything but second class

5       workers, without the same compensation afforded

6       to all our brothers and sisters at Local 100

7       working under the MTA new contract.

8                   Cleaning protocol are needed. The ATU

9       supports a recently mandated 24-hour cleaning

10      schedule of all transit equipment and the

11      overnight subway closures. The MTA Authority

12      already enjoys shuttle bus replacements with

13      parts on system that's shut down and should rely

14      solely on MTA bus operators and replace public

15      employees operators for non-union drivers. ATU

16      supports the cessation of private operations

17      doing the overnight hours and [unintelligible]

19      hours while the subways remain closed for

22      members as a second class citizen without the

23      same compensation afforded to our brothers and

2       show up to work despite these real threats to

3       their health and safety. We believe that our

4       members should be compensated for their work

5       through the implementation of hazard pay, which

6       would be 1.5 times their normal wage or rate,

7       funding provide by the general government should

8       be allocated to the membership. The hard working

9       men and women came to work and ensure that other

10      essential workers to get to where needed to go.

11      Their dedication and hard work must be recognized

12      and never marginalized.

13                  The MTA requires our members to work as

14      second class public servants without the same

15      compensation afforded to our brothers and sisters

16      at Local 100, working under the MTA's new

17      contract.

18                  We know all of these initiatives require

20      facing the state right now is dire, but ATU

22      of $32 million in emergency operating aid for the

2       will be used to maintain essential service, avoid

3       in a city this size. But does it not shine

4       attention to public service, delivering public

5       transit as a second class worker at the same

7                  The lack of financial support from the

8       federal government also impacts the ability to

9       finalize the contract for our members with the

10      MTA. For decades, [unintelligible] [02:35:18]

11      bargaining at the MTA resulted in the members of

12      ATU receiving the same benefit negotiated between

13      TW 100 and MTA. This year the MTA refuses to

14      honor this pattern of bargaining, settling our

15      contracts collectively involves very little

17      need to ensure the MTA receives adequate funding

19      happy to answer any questions that you may have.

2       for your service and for your leadership. And I

3       mentioned in my opening remarks earlier, but I

4       want to mention it again. Our hearts go out to

5       the families that have lost loved ones during

6       this very difficult time.

7                  Chairman Foye mentioned earlier today

8       that 131 individuals have lost their lives across

9       the system. Those are individuals that sacrificed

10      everything for the betterment of our community.

11      And we can never forget them and we have to honor

12      them and their sacrifice, a real sacrifice, by

13      get up and going to work every day to make sure

14      that the system functions so that, as many of you

15      testified today, the essential workers on the

16      frontlines that are fighting back this horrific

17      virus can get to their places of employment, and

18      so that our communities can function. So once

19      again, thank you to each and every one of you.

20                 I can take pieces of each of your

21      testimonies and tie them up because they were

22      consistent, that there's been concern about

23      having enough PPE, enough sanitizer, enough

24      safety materials, the concern about security and

2       enforcement of the precautions and the

3       requirements of wearing a mask, simply wearing a

4       mask. You know, 90 percent, the 90 percent number

5       I think, Tony, you brought that up. Chairman Foye

6       said 95 percent earlier, although he was just

7       putting a number out there. You know, any time

8       it's not universal, we're putting people at risk,

9       and because of that, it's essential that we have

10      the enforcement mechanism in place. Each of you

11      testified to this effect.

12                 I'd like to ask Chairman Simon a little

13      bit about this. The enforcement mechanisms that

14      are in place, can you talk about what's

15      happening. I know that there's been attacks and

16      some aggressive acts against conductors and other

17      members of your workforce, and harassment. Can

18      you talk about the policing of the requirements

19      that are in place and the need for more as well

20      as the essential workforce, the potential for

21      cuts, and what that could possibly do as well?

22                 MR. SIMON:           Thank you, senator, for that

23      except. I can absolutely talk about how the

24      assaults and the harassment on frontline

2       conductors has gone up so much and we've been

3       begging for more police. It seems like the

4       commuter routes are being shortchanged for

5       policing on the trains and we need more of that.

6                  To try to ask somebody to put a mask on

7       is a very difficult situation for a frontline

8       conductor. He or she either gets spit on,

9       harassed with threatened. As you might have seen

10      there's a wanted poster now out for somebody

11      pulling out a knife on a conductor then jumping

12      out the window before he can get caught, kicking

13      out the emergency window.

14                 Our members continue to come in and face

15      this ever day, yet we are begging for more police

16      on the trains. We shouldn't have to be begging.

17      It should be something that should be done

18      automatically. The funds that they use for safety

19      and security, we should have all the safety and

20      security experts at the MTA saying our

21      organization, to the TWU to ACRE, to all of us,

22      what can we do to better protect your members?

4       pushed to the side. That has to stop. If you care

5       about us, then show it with your actions, not

6       with words, and that is what's so frustrating.

7       When we talk about reduction of forces, how could

8       you discuss reducing or laying off, like my

9       brothers have said, any essential worker when we

10      came in and some gave their lives? It just is

11      mind-blowing that you could even talk about that.

12      They talked about their hiring is not happening.

13      If you just look at their posts, their posting

14      for $200,000 a year jobs. How could you do that?

15      How could you hire -- I ran out of abbreviations

16      for who they hire COO, CEO, CFO, CWO, CRO, it's

17      just gotten out of control, and I'm not trying to

18      be disrespectful to the senior management but

3       of dollars trines formation team. We know how to

4       do it. We have been doing it as labor leaders.

5       We're not standing here as pigs saying we want

6       all the money. We're working with them. When are

7       they going to work with us? When we talked about

8       Brother Utano and the TWU, they all deserve that

9       money, they all deserve those raises. So do all

10      of us. But we are being put back, when in the

11      height of this pandemic they gave out millions of

12      dollars, millions in contract, and they deserve

13      it.

14                 So I've spoken to all the brothers and

15      sisters over at the TWU and ACRE and ALIGN and

19      we're broke, but we're going to hire a $250,000 a

20      have a year senior management. That's being done.

21                 If you notice, Mr. Foye's statement was,

22      no, we're not going to. He basically said when

23      asked, well we have, I can't say we're not going

24      to, we're going to look at those places. We're

2       going to look to cut essential workers. I just

3       cannot see how you can do that. We have to stop

4       and really consider. Why not every senior manager

5       that makes over 200,000? Why don't they take a

6       cut? Why don't they take a cut in their salary?

7       That would be a good way to show leadership, but

8       that's not happening. So, thank you, senator, for

9       your question.

10                 SENATOR KENNEY:              Thank you, Chairman

11      Simon. And again thank you for your leadership.

12      Recognizing, I'm short on time here. I want to

13      ask one other question and again, President

14      Utano, you alluded to this in your testimony

15      about the pandemic response plan. Obviously this

16      virus upended everything as we know it both here

17      in our country and across the globe and took

18      everyone by surprise.

19                 That being said, there was a pandemic

20      response plan. Can you talk about the

21      implementation of that? Obviously you were not

22      pleased with how it was implemented. But can you

23      talk about recommendations on moving forward and

24      what we can do better in preparing for the

2       future. Look, we are not out of the woods yet

3       with this first wave. We may see a second wave

4       coming this fall. We need to be prepared. What

5       can we do, in your mind, to get ahead of it at

6       this moment?

7                  MR. UTANO:           So right now in my own mind

8       I just learned that they updated a 2012 pandemic

9       plan to 2017. And what they do is they update

10      these policies, they don't include us. We need to

11      be included. We need to be able to tell them what

12      went wrong because we were all on the frontline.

13      We were there with the members. We know what went

14      wrong. They weren't getting the PPE out in the

15      beginning as quickly as we needed it. They were

16      following CDC guidelines, we told them they were

17      wrong. And they said, and that pandemic that they

18      talked about in 2012, they never even mentioned

19      it. It was like they found it, they dusted it

20      off, and that pandemic plan says they're supposed

21      to store masks in case of a pandemic.

22                 So what I'm concerned about, and I guess

23      what everybody should be concerned about, is a

24      second wave coming. If a second wave is coming,

2       we cannot operate the same way that this first

3       wave came here. We can't. We have to have a mask.

4       If we don't have masks, then we're not going to

5       work because we've got families too. We have

6       families. We go home and we've got, we're going

7       to get exposed to this and we're going to expose

8       our family to this, we need the PPE. That's one

9       of the biggest pieces of the pandemic plan that

10      was not implemented.

11                 They had some masks. They said well,

12      these masks were for PPE, for when you do your

13      job. Yeah, but you're supposed to have masks in

14      case this happens. When Ebola happened, they had

15      a plan, apparently. I don't know where those

16      masks went. Maybe they had a budget cut and they

17      stopped buying masks and were using that masks

18      that they had. You can't keep putting pandemic

19      plans in place without including all the unions.

20      We are the voice of the people. We know what went

21      wrong out there.

22                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you, President

23      Utano. And I'll tell you I hit the nail on the

2       advocate for. We know we're in the middle of this

3       have pandemic. We know we're not out of woods. We

4       need labor at the table. We need the people on

5       the frontlines that are understanding the

6       implications at the very grassroots level, and so

7       we will advocate for that.

8                  MR. UTANO:           Thank you.

9                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               And without further

15      Chair Paulin, and gentlemen, thank you so much

16      for testifying today. And, you know, the words

17      above and beyond don't go, don't explain the kind

18      of work that all of your members did over the

19      last five months. My grandfather was a TWU Local

20      100 mechanic in the Coney Island yards. The work

21      all your members do is so essential to making New

23      insight from all of you about 24/7 service in the

2       Utano. Is it possible, is it safe, should we do

3       it? Because I know it's very concerning for many

4       of my constituents that feel we've lost an aspect

5       of city life and we may not get it back.

6                  MR. UTANO:           I didn't hear the beginning

7       of that question, I'm sorry.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARROLL:                     24-hour

9       service of the subways, is it possible to get

10      back? Is it safe to get back to doing that?

11      Because I know lots of my constituents want to

12      see 24-hour service of the subways continue, or

13      be reinstated.

14                 MR. UTANO:           I believe, I believe that if

15      we could sit down with a plan together, we can do

16      it. We have lots of people working here. We have

17      lots of cleaners able to do it. We don't need to

18      bring the private contractors in and spend money.

19      We need to start using the resources that we have

20      in-house. We can't keep going outside, getting

21      consultants and getting everybody to tell us what

22      to do. I think we could sit at the table, and I

23      think we could come up with a plan, yes.

24                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARROLL:                     And can you

2       tell me more about those private contractors

3       because I've heard of that. I've heard that the

4       MTA is using them. How many are they using? And

5       why are they not using your members to clean

6       subway stations?

7                  MR. UTANO:           Okay. They are using our

8       members to clean. They are using our members to

9       clean. When the pandemic first hit, and they

10      changed the regulations to cleaning every 24

11      hours, it was a little difficult because of a lot

12      of our members were sick from the virus. Okay, so

13      they brought the contractors in because we didn't

14      have the manpower. But now we're in pretty much

15      full force. We know now what we need to do to

16      protect ourselves, we know we need to wear masks,

17      we need to know, we have to social distance. We

18      know the rules, and if we sit down, I think we

19      can come up with a plan. I think together we can

20      come up with a plan to clean the trains. They

21      have other stuff that they're investigating right

22      now, right, they're doing the UV lights. They're

23      doing the spraying. They now, I believe they're

24      purchasing these sprayers. Our cleaners can go in

2       and spray the trains just as quickly instead of

3       standing there and wiping it down, you can get

4       those sprays and spray them. And there are other

5       things that they're looking at that can expedite

6       the process.

7                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARROLL:                     President

8       Utano or anyone else, because this goes the same

9       for the commuter retails, in your opinion, how

10      much capacity could the system handle as more

11      people maybe go back to work or school? How many

12      more trains do we need to run? How safe is it for

13      folks to be on subway cars or in buses and at

14      what capacity? Because that's obviously the thing

15      that so many folks are grappling with is, are kid

16      going to start going back to school, are more

17      people going back to work, people moving around.

18      What do we need to do to make sure that your

19      members are safe, but that also commuters are

20      safe and that we have the capacity in the system

21      to make sure they stay safe?

22                 MR. VALENTE:            Yeah, I'll touch on that

23      for Metro-North. It's mask, mask adherence. So a

24      conductor can only do so much, tell a passenger,



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       hey, please wear your mask. The conductor walks

3       away. Same issue five minutes later or ten

4       minutes later. So a police presence on the trains

5       is really needed. They could definitely do things

6       we can't. We've asked for it in numerous letters.

7       It's been pretty much ignored by the officials at

8       Metro-North, even at the MTA. They don't address

9       it.

10                 And the other thing we can do, since

11      mask adherence is difficult and the MTA seems not

12      to want to put the MTA police on the trains is

13      run the most service that you can. And that's

14      something that ACRE has been pushing for, and I

15      know the other commuter rail, Long Island I'm

16      sure would like the same, and I'm sure the TW

17      would also. If you can't put police on the trains

18      to make people and oversee them wearing masks,

19      spread people out as much as you can.

20                 MR. DEJESUS:            The problem being is that

21      even though with social distancing, like Ed said,

22      about masks, wearing masks, and the areas that my

23      membership work and drive their bus, a lot of

24      people will fight you on the mask, and the



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       problem being is the social distancing is hard to

3       keep on a bus, and we're losing part of that bus.

4       And when they start opening that front door, our

5       operators is that the operators will start

6       getting sick again, because when they had that

7       divider, the numbers started going down. The

8       pandemic with this started going down and less

9       operators were getting sick.

10                 But the thing about it is they cannot

11      put this flimsy things, and the last thing use a

12      curtain, we can't move the curtain, you can't see

13      driving at night. But all these provisions

14      they're making, and like Tony said, there's other

15      companies, other bus companies that run in Vegas

16      and they're completely closed off from the public

17      and it protects the operator altogether. So we

18      have to invest in new equipment.

19                 But they're trying all these steps to

20      change something but you're not going after the

21      real problem. The problem is that the operator

22      will close that curtain when they're loading and

23      unloading but what happens when a passenger comes

24      and asks a question and coughs or whatever.

2       There's no reaction time. There's no way to keep

3       the operators safe. And the thing is, is about

4       the mask.

5                   And the MTA tells you we're trying to

6       have people out there police it. We don't know

7       how. We can't enforce it. We really can't tell

8       them how. And the comments Foye said that we have

9       people wearing masks, I don't think that's fully

10      truthful. Not all communities wear their masks,

11      really.

12                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                   Thank you.

13                  MR. DEJESUS:           And when school starts

14      these buses are getting more crowded. They really

15      are.

16                  MR. UTANO:          It has to be enforced. It

17      has to be enforced by the police, not our

18      members, because our members are always the

19      target. We don't carry guns. We transport people

20      to where they got to go safely to get to their

21      job. When we become the targets, they have TBTA

22      people, they have police, MTA cops, they have

23      transit cops. They need to do some kind of hit

24      and continuous hit to show people that

2       sporadically they're going to pop on buses,

3       they're going to pop on the trains, and then

4       people are going to say, I better wear my mask,

5       and they've got to enforce and it maybe give you

6       a person a ticket for not wearing a mask. You

7       know what? Give them a $100 ticket. And I know

8       it's hard for people to pay the ticket, but you

9       know what, it's a lot harder to go to a funeral

10      for somebody who passed away because you didn't

11      wear your mask.

2       on in the pandemic. And I'm very glad that the

3       MTA finally came to providing the unfortunately,

4       the death benefits for the large number of

5       transit workers who have succumbed.

6                  When we get the MTA leadership or

7       management in front of these hearings, I often

8       ask them about financial matters just because

9       over the years it's not always easy to believe

10      what they say when it comes to operating matters

11      because you ask them operating questions, they

12      tell you one thing, and then we get the people

13      who actually do the work in the tunnels and on

14      the streets, which is all of you guys, and we get

15      a totally different answer.

16                 And so I just want to be clear that what

17      I'm hearing in your initial responses and in your

18      response to some of these questions so far is

19      that you think the system can, can go back to a

20      24-hour system. Is my understanding correct or

21      there's some provisos to that?

22                 MR. UTANO:           I think, I mean, you guys

23      want to answer? But I'll answer. I believe yeah,

24      we could and we should go back to a 24-hour

2       system and figure out a plan to disinfect those

3       trains. We have the cleaners. We have the people,

4       and disinfect those trains and buses.

5                  SENATOR LIU:            Because the MTA is

6       basically, they basically say that they can't go

7       back to 24 hours because they need time to clean

8       the system, and meanwhile your members are doing

9       the cleaning and the maintenance. It's kind of

10      relatively new to me that they're hiring a lot of

11      outside people to come in to do the cleaning, but

12      operationally you think it can be done with TWU

13      and the current workforce.

14                 MR. DEJESUS:            The thing about it,

15      senator, we're not asking to reinvent the wheel

16      and that's what MTA keeps trying to do, try to

17      reinvent the wheel. Meantime, there's a workforce

18      between Local 100 and all the other unions that

19      they have guys there. If you do the proper

20      training, they can do the job and then do the job

21      wholeheartedly because they know what's at risk,

22      and that's the difference. That MTA is looking

23      outside, looking beyond what is sitting right in

24      front of them, with these union workers that are

2       willing to do the work. And that's our biggest

3       fight with them. You have them sitting in front

4       of you. The farm system is right in front of you.

5       Use them.

6                   SENATOR LIU:           Okay. That's very helpful.

7                   MR. SIMON:          Senator, I agree with that.

8       We're fully prepared as a union, as a membership.

9       My organization represents conductors as well as

10      cleaners, and we're fully prepared. But you've

11      got to utilize us and talk to us about what you

12      think is best, and get our opinions. Don't -- the

13      easy thing for them to do, and it seems like the

14      MTA it's always easy to just shoot a phone call

15      out to a consultant. That's just easier instead

16      of getting us in a room and figuring it out.

17                  We have full service right now. We're

18      prepared. Let us do our jobs that we do best,

19      we've been doing all along instead of taking the

20      easy course and going to consultants. It's at

21      this point now, where they're throwing away

22      money. And I think in that report that came out

23      where Ms. Feinberg from the transit talked about

24      how there are so many consultants here that we

2       don't even know where they are. Well, you know

3       where our members are. They're very easy to be

4       found. We're working.

5                  MR. KELLEY:           Senator Liu, Robert Kelley.

6       I'm in stations. Cleaners fall under me. Our

7       cleaners have been operating with the ridership

8       from the beginning of time, with high pressure

9       hoses and doing a phenomenal job. We don't work

10      on GOs, but some from time to time.                        But when the

11      contractors came on, the authority gave them GOs

12      to work with, so that they can prove they are

13      better than us. They failed. They straight up

14      failed.

15                 Our workers are the best in the

16      business, sir. We clean every day with crowded

17      platforms, we rope things off. We're

18      professionals. We do this every day. We certainly

19      can. This system needs to open up 24 hours. This

20      is the moral fiber of what New York City is built

21      on, that's the bottom line. We can handle it.

22                 SENATOR LIU:            Thank you. You know, one

23      last quick question, which is the MTA said they

24      need all this money. I hope that they get all

2       this money from the federal government, but

3       again, it's important to know what the numbers

4       really are. Out of the $12 billion that Pat Foye

5       is asking for now, that includes $2.7 billion of

6       expense basically, over expenditures over the

7       next four years, about $2 billion of which is

8       within that $12 billion.

9                  So my question to you, Tony and the

10      other leaders, have you all gotten a huge pain

11      crease? Because the MTA seems to be spending $2

12      billion more in operating costs.

13                 MR. UTANO:           No, but I wanted to let you

14      know that Anthony said they were putting jobs out

15      for $200,000, it's more like 300,000. They hire

16      the transformation officer McCord? I don't even

17      know where he is. What are they paying him for?

18      What does he do?

19                 SENATOR LIU:            So what do you think --

20                 MR. UTANO:           [unintelligible] [02:59:15]

21      we ain't getting that money, you know. We ain't

22      getting that money. These gentlemen don't have

23      the contract. I have a contract. And they should

24      get a contract, right. But what are we asking

2       for, two percent raises? [unintelligible]

3       [02:59:29].

4                  SENATOR LIU:            I think what I'm hearing

5       from you is that they're actually, they are

6       contracts, not labor contracts, but contracts

7       with these outside companies that are being

8       brought in to do work that we already have a

9       workforce at the MTA ready, willing and able to

10      do.

11                 MR. UTANO:           Yes, absolutely.

12                 SENATOR LIU:            Thank you. Thank you very

13      much for all the work that your members do.

2       during this COVID pandemic, so I'll thank you

3       again to you and your members.

4                  I did want to have more of a, it's not

5       so much a question, I just wanted some more input

6       from you gentlemen if I could. First, I want to

7       direct it to Mr. Simon. You guys may have covered

8       some of this in your testimony, but I think it's

9       important to go back over it and hear it. I

10      wanted to see from Mr. Simon, maybe you and

11      others afterward, if you could talk about what

12      SMART and your broad based membership you

13      represent, has done as essential workers. Maybe

14      describe some of your efforts and actions and, of

15      course, the challenges you encountered trying to

16      keep moving forward in keeping things running,

17      and probably most importantly, as Chairman

18      Kennedy mentioned, what recommendations would you

19      would you to offer to all of us, the MTA for

20      improvements, help in making things better as we

21      continue to move forward in situation for

22      everybody?

23                 MR. SIMON:           Thank you, assemblyman, for

24      that question. You know, our organization from

2       day one, we were 24/7. What I did as the leader

3       of the organization, I made accessible every

4       single union official who worked around the clock

5       at what we put together on the Long Island Rail

6       Road as a command center. That command center was

7       manned 24/7. We helped with the management side

8       to facilitate either people coming to work or not

9       coming to work, because we weren't getting enough

10      information as far as whose healthy and who's not

11      healthy.

12                 So the union stepped up with our smaller

13      resources that we have, because all of the

14      managers were home, working remotely. And what we

15      did was we facilitated the crew management book.

16      We facilitated getting people the proper rest

17      they needed. We actually did the job of crew

18      dispatching, what managers do because we wanted

19      to keep our members safe.

20                 What I recommend to the agency and that

21      this panel holds them accountable to is start

22      tapping into the resources of the labor

23      organizations who have 30 plus years experience,

24      I know I have 30 plus, I know Tony has 30 plus,

2       the other gentlemen. I mean, we have the

3       experience to show you how it's done. We're not

4       looking to hurt anybody. We're not always having

5       our hand out. If I remember correctly, they came

6       to us, the pandemic, they weren't prepared, and

7       it was the unions who made it work. It was us

8       that made it work. It was us that stepped up, it

9       was our members who stepped up. And at the end of

10      the day, we went three months trying to figure

11      out how to keep our members safe and how to get

12      PPE to our members.

13                 I mean, on the Long Island Rail Road at

14      some point we were making our own sanitizer. We

15      were making it with getting liquid, they were

16      given have giving us cloth to fill in a bottle

17      and mixed it with cloth to -- it was absolutely

18      out of control. Mask compliance was a problem.

19      First we needed them, then we didn't. But you

20      didn't see us running to the newspapers, you

21      didn't see us beating them in. What we did was we

22      worked with them. Mr. Eng and I were in constant

23      communication and I was in communication with

24      Foye, but there was a disconnect. There was a

2       disconnect. They should tap into us instead of

3       running to a consultant. You can negotiate a

4       contract with a consultant but the people that

5       are putting their lines on the line for you, you

6       cannot negotiate with. That makes no sense

7       whatever. That is actually throwing money out the

8       window. And I think at this point, what they can

9       do is start listening to the organizations who

10      have been there for them since day one. Thank

11      you.

12                 MR. DEJESUS:            Well, I remember back in

13      February, we were having meetings

14      [unintelligible] [03:03:46] about the PPE and the

15      masks, and they sat there and told us, no, it was

16      not possible, it is not receivable. We had enough

17      masks for them to work, for the guys to work on

18      the brakes and work on the buses and work on the

19      transit systems that are needed for that. In the

20      meantime, we argued just to give it to them to

21      give them a sort of comfort. And in the long run

22      what had was when they didn't have it, ATU unions

23      got together with the 726, was able to get us

24      masks, get masks from different suppliers that we



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       gave it our members, gave them masks, as many as

3       they needed, gloves as many as they needed, get

4       as much hand sanitizers that we could. And we

5       begged and borrowed and did what we needed to do

6       to take care of our members.

7                  And when MTA came to us about with

8       different proposals, we did not argue, like

9       Anthony said, we didn't argue with them. We made

10      it work. We listened to what they had to say and

11      we made it work. And when we took it on to our

12      members and some did it gratefully and some did

13      it willingly, but they did their jobs because

14      they needed move New York. People, they needed to

15      get people from place A, to work and back home to

16      their families.

17                 And the thing about it that gets me is

18      like Anthony said, we're not always looking for

19      the handout, we're looking for the greater good.

20      And our members are loyal to this city and are

21      loyal. They just want their fair share. They want

22      to get a day's wage for a day's work. That's all

23      they're looking for. And don't treat them any

24      differently than our sister unions and try to

5                  SENATOR MAYER:              I mean the issues of

6       having the trains be 24 hours, how many no

7       layoffs, what are the staffing needs.

8                  MR. UTANO:           I have not been called to

9       have a meeting, no.

10                 SENATOR MAYER:              Not a single meeting

11      with Chairman Foye?

12                 MR. UTANO:           Not in the past, I haven't

13      met with them in, I don't know, maybe, the past

14      two months.

15                 SENATOR MAYER:              You have not met with

16      Chairman Foye in the past two months?

17                 MR. UTANO:           No.

18                 SENATOR MAYER:              Is that true for your

19      other, the other union leaders who are here?

20                 MR. DEJESU:           My ATUs have been meeting

21      for impact bargaining and has turned away from

22      impact to basically griping on needs that we need

23      to do for our members and different things that

24      were needed. And we always get the same runaround

2       answer from week to week, and never an answer and

3       it never goes anywhere.

4                  SENATOR MAYER:              Understood.

5                  MR. DEJESUS:            And it got to the point

6       from the last meeting to say give us somebody

7       that can give us an answer, please, because this

8       is ridiculous. We're chasing our own tail.

9                  SENATOR MAYER:              Yes, I understand.

10                 MR. UTANO:           Just so I'm clear, right.

11      What we're talking about operations, like just

12      stuff that's going on every day not related to

13      the pandemic, but related to the pandemic,

14      layoffs or anything around that area, no, I have

15      not met with them.

16                 SENATOR MAYER:              No, I'm not talking

17      about your usual HR kind of issues. I'm talking

18      about the big issues we are talking about here

19      that you set out, Tony, at the beginning,

20      enforcement of the mask policy, testing, these

21      kinds of issues about how this major economic

22      engine for our city and our region is going to

23      continue to work.

24                 MR. UTANO:           No, we sent them ten-point

2       plan in the very beginning that we had, and we

3       didn't get a response. But some of the stuff on

4       the ten-point plan has been implemented and some

5       not. The latest is the NYU study that we sent

6       them, we wanted to do a study. They didn't

7       respondent, so we went from NYHU and said we want

8       to do a study, we want to know what happened

9       here. It's the same group that did the study for

10      the 9/11.

11                  SENATOR MAYER:             Right.

12                  MR. UTANO:          And now they're trying to

13      get into the study. And we welcome them into the

14      study. We want to see what happened here. We're

15      not trying to make this a big movie here. We're

16      trying to find out what happened, because we want

17      to prevent it from happening again.

18                  SENATOR MAYER:             Absolutely.

19                  MR. UTANO:          And in the very beginning

20      when they said they didn't need masks, I was at

21      that meeting that Jose was at, and I directly

22      told them we were told once before that we didn't

23      need masks. Remember when the trade center went

24      down and they said the air was good? Well, today

2       3,000 trans workers showed up to that pile, and

3       today we have people dying from that because

4       somebody in the EPA said you didn't need a mask,

5       so we said, we want to wear a mask. And they said

6       it wasn't part of the uniform, and then they came

7       off it. But every single thing we had to do was

8       always a fight. It wasn't always like, okay, you

9       guys are right. It was always a fight. But we

10      haven't met. And I don't know about these

11      gentlemen but I haven't, I haven't sat down with

12      them.

13                  SENATOR MAYER:              Well, I was interested

14      in yours. Ed, I have a question for you. Is there

15      a markedly diminished presence of the Metro-North

16      police on these trains, on your train?

17                  MR. VALENTE:            Yeah, unfortunately

18      there's zero police presence on the trains.

19      Unless they're called because of an incident,

20      they're actually not, they don't ride trains in

21      their daily routine. They stay at stations. And

22      something we've been pushing for since January,

23      due to an assault and a pattern of assaults over

24      the years, was police officers that are solely

2       responsible in their duties to ride the trains.

3       And it doesn't take that many to create a

4       presence on the trains. You know, you take two

5       police officers, start one in the front, start

6       one in the back, and they walk to meet, right,

7       and the passengers realize, wait, there's police

8       on the trains.

9                  And that's something we've been pushing

10      for and even more so now with the issues with the

11      masks. It's really very difficult for our

12      conductors to enforce that. It's impossible

13      without police enforcement supporting Metro-

14      North, the Long Island Rail Road, the subways,

15      the buses, because we're not police officers,

16      like President Utano said. We don't carry a gun.

17      We don't have that authority. And I've asked in

18      multiple letters to President Rinaldi and

19      Chairman Foye for police on the trains for this

20      purpose, and I've been ignored. So, it's

21      disheartening to say the least.

22                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you.

2       intend to follow up with Metro-North about that.

3       Thank you.

4                  MR. VALENTE:            I appreciate that.

5                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

6       much. Our next assembly speaker is Assembly

7       Member Steve Otis.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER OTIS:                   Thank you,

9       gentlemen, and thank you for what your members

10      have been doing and are going to continue to be

11      asked to do. And as ridership increases, we all

12      understand that the exposure to people that may

13      be carrying the virus is going to be out there.

14      And so your members are very brave.

15                 I have a question. Just back to the mask

16      issue, as it relates to customers. And for New

17      York City Transit, subway and bus, for Long

18      Island Rail Road and for Metro-North, for each of

19      these units, what is the hard and fast rule? And

20      is there signage on buses or on cars that say you

21      can only ride with a mask? And what is the stated

22      policy? And it may vary between conveyance here,

23      so I'd like you to go down the four that I listed

24      and let us know what is being done right now.

2                  MR. DEJESUS:            On the buses, there is

3       signage. There is a message set every 15 to 20

4       minutes, [unintelligible] [03:12:40] are

5       bilingual to wear a mask, but as for the

6       enforcement part, there is really no enforcement

7       that a bus driver can enforce that unless he

8       calls the command center, and the command center

9       is going to tell him keep the bus moving

10      basically.

11                 And then what the problem is, it puts

12      the operator in a certain predicament because the

13      public, the riding public is going to look to the

14      operator to do something. So now we've got a

15      confrontational issue. And our drivers are not --

16      having too many operators assaulted, spat on, or

17      verbally assaulted and called names, especially

18      our female operators. And the thing about it is

19      we don't come to work to drive a bus for that

20      reason. They want to get people to where they

21      need to go, but they're subject to that, and MTA

22      is leaving that door open and not closing it or

23      trying to close it and use the people around

24      them, especially in other transit hubs, the main

2       transit hubs and show police a presence. That we

3       can't get, we can't get them to promise that.

4                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER OTIS:                   And what about

5       the subways?

6                  MR. UTANO:           On the subways, they are

7       starting to put stickers around the cabs and

8       social distancing stickers and our conductors are

9       making announcements to wear the masks. But

10      again, if there's no enforcement, I mean, we can

11      make all the announcements we want. I'm not

12      advising any of my members to go out and say

13      you've got to wear a mask. We need some police

14      presence. We need somebody on the train to walk

15      around and say, you need to put your mask on or

16      you need to leave, you know, if you don't want to

17      get the ticket, then you need to leave. If you're

18      not going to follow the rules, I go into a 99-

19      cent store, if I don't have a mask, I get thrown

20      out of that store, so why should it be any

21      different on a subway? You go in a subway. You

22      know what? You do not even have to wear a mask.

23      You can wear a face piece, right, they've

24      downgraded it that you can just put a face piece

2       around you. So there's no excuse where people say

3       they can't get a mask. They could wear a face

4       piece. It's just about enforcement. That's the

5       problem.

6                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER OTIS:                   I mean, in a

7       store people can be in and out of a store in two

8       minutes. You're on a conveyance, it's an extended

9       period of time, so it heightens the risk. How

10      about the commuter rails?

11                 MR. SIMON:           As far as the Long Island

12      Rail Road, I think public affairs and public

13      relationships in my opinion have been doing a

14      good job getting the message out there and the

15      conductors putting the message out there. But it

16      still goes back to what Tony and everybody says.

17      Compliance, we get into confrontations. You can't

18      put our frontline employees in that predicament,

19      you just can't put them. Safety is supposed to be

20      the number one concern, and at this point, as Ed

21      said and we've all been echoing, they have what

22      they -- years ago, they used to have train

23      patrols. They have none now, for police. Train

24      patrols were police. We're begging them to put

2       train patrols back on. Like Ed had said, they

3       start from the front and the back and work their

4       way to the middle.

5                    When you see a police officer, I

6       remember back in the day, when we had state

7       troopers our trains. Well, nobody did anything.

8       The state trooper walked through that train, just

9       the presence that of state trooper. All we want

10      is the MTA police to start focusing on the

11      commuter rails and start putting train patrol

12      back on the trains so that we can feel safe

13      again.

14                   So as far as the information that's

15      going out there, we can't force them to do it,

16      like Tony said, we can't say oh by the way -- we

17      all have heard horror stories about somebody

18      telling somebody to put a mask on and it becomes

19      violent. So get the train patrols back on the

20      trains where they should be with the MTA police

21      and maybe that would help.

22                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER OTIS:                   Metro-North?

23                   MR. VALENTE:            Yeah, I mean Anthony said

2       issues we have. We do have signs. The conductors

3       make the announcement. But we can't enforce it. I

4       actually asked if this was enforceable by law

5       enforcement beginning early on, and I didn't get

6       a response, so there's really no clear cut policy

7       from the railroad on what's enforceable, what the

8       police will do, and zero police presence on the

9       train, is a recipe for disaster.

19      speaking up today and talking during the hearing,

20      listening to the MTA and giving us the feedback.

21      I just wanted to follow up on the line of

22      questioning that Shelly Mayer started regarding

23      how much consultation have you been getting from

24      or talking to the MTA about the pandemic work and

2       your challenges working with the pandemic. So I

3       think all of you said that you haven't had any

4       real feedback or opportunity for confrontation

5       with them in the last three months or so. Is that

6       correct?

7                  MR. SIMON:           I can speak on behalf of

8       Long Island Rail Road. The only thing we're

9       getting is they're letting us know how broke they

10      are and how bad it is and we can't sit down at

11      the table with you. You know, that's again

12      another slap in the face. And going back to the

13      relationships that all these unions have built,

14      that in itself, we have built relationships with

15      not only the Senate and Congress, you know, and

16      they've asked us to help with the funding and

17      we've done that.

18                 So why are you not talking to us yet?

19      You want us out speaking to Congress and Senate

20      for the funding, which we think is proper, but

21      yet you're not having a conversation with the

22      union leaders about what our members are worth,

23      what they deserve and the safety of them. I mean

24      at this point, we're getting tired of hearing of

2       how broke you are when you're not cutting from

3       the fat at the top and you're talking and you're

4       sending messages out to our employees who were

5       here for the pandemic. The messages you're

6       sending them, oh, by the way, we might to have

7       lay you of you off.

8                  That's an absolute disgrace and I think

9       they should be ashamed of themselves for saying

10      that or even thing along the lines of looking at

11      essential workers to be furloughed or to be laid

12      off. It just doesn't make any sense when Tony and

13      I and I both said it, $200,000, $300,000. I was

14      being generous. If one of those jobs you want to

15      look for, they're online, they're two or $300,000

16      jobs. It's insane.

17                 SENATOR COMRIE:              I brought it up, as you

18      know, from the hearings that we first had of the

19      issue of all of the jobs that are on the books

20      but off the books at the MTA. Sarah Feinberg

21      mentioned it, but from her sounding today, they

22      already got to her, so she's already spun what

23      her original focus was. I was very sorry to hear

24      her reaction. I didn't want to call her on it at



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       the time, because I was short, but clearly, she

3       is starting to drink the water unfortunately.

4                  So, we need to do everything we can to

5       work with you, all of the unions, and I know that

6       while we can't do direct contract negotiation,

7       that there needs to be an understanding that the

8       essential workers need to be maintained ahead of

9       the management. And I did ask her whether or not

10      she would get a real chart on and a real update

11      on what their employee status is and who is there

12      at the MTA. They've never provided that type of

13      transparency as to all of those people that are

14      working in management there.

15                 And to hear that management was too

16      chicken to even come out during a pandemic to

17      support you guys out in the frontlines and they

18      were doing it from their offices is very

19      disappointing, also. So I want to say that I'm

20      just so proud of all of the work that you guys

21      are doing. Ed, I've gotten your request regarding

22      the assaults. I don't understand why you're

23      getting so many assaults up there and it has not

24      been addressed. We will work to make sure that

2       the MTA is making sure that they're working with

3       PD up that way to do more.

4                  For whatever reason your people are

5       being assaulted and is that's something that we

6       should not tolerate. Anyone who is assaulting an

7       essential worker during this time needs to be

8       punished to the full extent of the law allowed.

9                  I can't thank all of you gentlemen

10      enough for what you're doing. Please keep in

11      constant contact with our offices so that we can

12      help advocate for you so that we're not doing it

13      after they testify but before they come to the

14      table, so that they can know that it's part of

15      the process. I hope that also tomorrow at their

16      board meeting, you're submitting your testimony

17      as well, so that the board can know the

18      frustration of the unions as well.

19                 They should not have to balance their

20      budget on the backs of the essential workers.

21      While we know that this is a difficult time and

22      an uncertain time with federal funding, there is

23      no need to eliminate the people that are actually

24      providing the service. You guys are the tip of

2       the spear. You've lost a lot of people that

3       wanted to work because you had a desire to keep

4       the system running.

5                    That has to be commended, but it has to

6       be respected, and it also has to be understood by

7       the MTA that they should provide opportunities

8       for the essential workers to keep their jobs

9       ahead of management and consultants. So I want to

10      thank you for your service. I want to thank you

11      for your continued efforts to fight. And you can

12      count on us in the legislature to back you up as

13      much as possible. Thank you all for being here

14      today.

15                   MR. UTANO:           Thank you. Thank you so

16      much.

17                   ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. I

18      have no more assembly speakers. I just want to

19      also mention, like the assembly members who did

20      speak and the senators who just spoke, we just

21      really want to be here to support you. We want to

22      keep you safe, your families safe. We've heard

23      today so much about that concern above all else,

24      as we all feel during this horrible pandemic, and

2       so I was wondering, I think Tony you mentioned

3       you had a list of 12 items. Were they all related

4       to safety?

5                  MR. UTANO:           Ten-point plan.

6                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    I'm sorry, ten-

7       point plan?

8                  MR. UTANO:           Ten-point plan, we can send

9       it over to you.

10                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    That would be

11      great. I would love to see a copy of that and to

12      know from you which ones were implemented and

13      which ones weren't. I also wondered along those

14      same lines and same questioning that I've heard,

15      has there been any conversations about cost

16      savings or cost cutting, or for your input across

17      the board, Metro-North, LIRR, subways, transit

18      system? Because we're hearing that there could be

19      dire consequences if there's no federal money.

20      Has there been anything in advance so that, you

21      know, we and you have some sense of what might

22      happen?

23                 MR. SIMON:           Can I just make a quick

24      comment on that? It's kind of hard coming to the

2       unions when they've been delivering all along and

3       saving them even during a pandemic, showing them

4       how to cut costs so that we can get through this

5       pandemic, and to ask the unions to keep cutting

6       and ask for savings to the unions while they're

7       not showing it themselves, I mean, put yourselves

8       in our shoes as leaders. How do we go to our

9       members and say to them, oh, by the way we've got

10      to cut a little bit more, we've got to take away

11      from this, we've got to knock away your crew book

12      and we've got to take away from the size of the

13      crews, or the amount of the hours you work when

14      we have upper management making the astronomical

15      salaries that they're making while sitting on a

16      zoom meeting at home.

17                 I can tell you we have 11 branches on

18      the Long Island Rail Road. I traveled all 11

19      branches during this pandemic to check mask

20      compliance myself personally, to talk to my

21      crews, to talk to the men and women, what they

22      were feeling. I have been out there to the track

23      department. Janno Lieber mentioned about 500

24      projects being done. Well, who did that? Who did



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       that? It was our members, my track workers. We

3       were out there. They were on Zoom. They were

4       home. And I'm sorry, but I'm passionate about the

5       fact that I had Senator Kennedy come out and see

6       the work that our men and women did on the track

7       department and he was amazed at the work that

8       they do and that all the other unions do on the

9       track, and yet those 500 projects that we

10      accomplished, they cut the ribbons yesterday.

11                 Wow, that's wonderful, wonderful ribbon

12      cutting. Did you see anybody there? Did you see

13      any workers there? Social distancing, I

14      understand, but you could have social distanced

15      and thanked the employees that were there during

16      the pandemic. I'm upset about that. I'm upset

17      about a lot of things that when you come down to

18      it, you're asking to us to cut. You don't want to

19      give us a contract, which understandably we may

20      not have money. But you have money to pay these

21      salaries and get these consultants in.

22                 So, no disrespect to Tony and his great

23      workforce, but during the heart of the pandemic,

24      the heart of the pandemic, they got back pay and

2       they got their raises. God bless you, Tony, and

3       your membership who deserves it, but what are we?

4       Are we second class people that we don't deserve

5       that? Where did you find that money from? That's

6       the question that should be asked. Where did that

7       money come from? Thank you.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    No, I hear what

9       you're saying you and you make excellent points

10      and there has to be more of a dialogue clearly

11      going forward or we're not going to get through

12      this whole thing, so the lack of a dialogue is

13      very concerning.

14                 SENATOR COMRIE:              I hear what you're

15      saying also. I put in a transparency bill to look

16      at management at the MTA. I hope that we can get

17      that bill passed, because I'm sick and tired of

18      them dodging that question about transparency in

19      their upper management. There are a lot of people

20      that are there that even, as I said earlier,

21      Feinberg realized she doesn't know who the hell

22      is there and getting all this money in upper

23      management.

24                 And it's time the MTA comes clean,

2       especially now. So we hope to help you and we

3       understand clearly what you're going through and

4       we want to do whatever we can to call the MTA on

5       that so that they can be totally transparent

6       about where they're spending their money in

7       management and in contract.

8                  MR. DEJESUS:            The thing about it,

9       senators and assembly, Tony's contract at 100

10      wasn't done last week or last month. It was done

11      last year, before the pandemic took effect.

12                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Right.

13                 MR. DEJESUS:            So, they understand that

14      their pattern of bargaining happens. What

15      happened to that? What happened to that money?

16      What happened to -- I just don't understand how

17      you could be so shortsighted, and yet during

18      these meetings they're talking about money

19      happening three years from now, but when it comes

20      to labor, they're very shortsighted with us.

21                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    No, I

22      understand.

23                 MR. DEJESUS:            And they expect to put the

24      brunt on our backs.

2                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Got it.

3                  MR. VALENTE:            And just to add one more

4       thing, I think everyone said it really well, but

5       during the pandemic, the essential workers showed

6       up every day, came in, ran the trains, cleaned

7       the trains, were there for the mechanical issues,

8       and management was at home. So if you look at

9       those two things, right, it just shows who is

10      really needed.

11                 So to look at the essential workers and

12      say, hey, you know you guys need to take a cut.

13      Well, you want to sacrifice service to take a

14      cut? That doesn't seem like the right way to go,

15      especially when we should be spreading people

16      out, running more service. It didn't work in the

17      great recession reducing service. That actually

18      hurt us coming back. So it's not the right way to

19      go about it.

20                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    No, I

21      understand what you're saying. All right, well,

22      thank you very much. That concludes this panel.

23      We have --

24                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you all.

2                    ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Yes, thank you.

3       We have our panel three. However, my

4       understanding is that panel four, neither of the

5       two people who were going to testify are able to,

6       but one of them has a substitute, so in texting

7       with Senator Comrie back and forth, we agreed to

8       just merge that one speaker. Maybe she could even

9       go first or he. And then we could go on to panel

10      three.

15      of the Public Interest is unfortunately out sick

16      today, so I am able to read her testimony. And I

2       very much for the opportunity to speak with you

3       about the effects that COVID-19 has had on

4       Access-A-Ride customers, who are also New Yorkers

5       with disabilities. Thank you to Senator Kennedy,

10      troubling times under COVID-19. As an Access-A-

11      Ride user, I am grateful that the MTA has

12      implemented several safety measures to keep its

13      customers and drivers safe. However communication

14      need to be improved. So far, it has been left up

15      to the community to let each other know what is

16      going on, rather than announcing these changes in

17      the citywide MTA newsletter which goes out

18      monthly. To [unintelligible] [03:30:42] other of

19      the customers who use access-a-ride would be

20      against the Americans with Disabilities Act and

21      it sets a dangerous precedent, the discrimination

22      of any kind against people with disabilities is

23      okay.

24                  As a double amputee with lupus, I can

2       tell you it's never okay. I have been a customer

3       with Access-A-Ride for 11 years now. I have

4       experienced everything under the sun, from

5       accidents to screaming matches with rude drivers

6       to sexual harassment to six-hour rides. I've gone

7       through it all simply because I'm disabled.

8                  Before COVID-19, I used Access-A-Ride

9       six days a week. Most days I'd be out of the

10      house around 7:00 a.m. and wouldn't return until

11      7:00 or 8:00 in the evening. Why? Because I had

12      an extremely packed schedule with early morning

13      meetings or classes, meetings scattered

14      throughout the city, work to do in the office,

15      workshops at various elected offices, and

16      outreach all over the city in places that

17      serviced people with disabilities. I often would

18      say as long as my above knee leg was charged, I'd

19      be good to go.

20                 I was relieved that Access-A-Ride

21      implemented several new rules that drivers and

22      independent contractors within the MTA should

23      abide by. I also want to particularly thank all

24      of you state legislators and your colleagues who

2       co-sponsored and voted to memorialize these rules

3       in law in the spring legislative session, despite

4       the bill ultimately being vetoed.

5                  The rules are that all drivers must wear

6       masks and gloves, that shared rides are

7       discontinued to allow as much social distancing

8       as possible within the vehicle, that all vehicles

9       are disinfected at least daily and the dedicated

10      blue and white vehicles are regularly treated

11      with antimicrobial shields. That rides have been

12      free, which avoids having to exchange cash

13      between drivers and riders. That recertification

14      is automatically extended to avoid in-person

15      assessments, many of which we viewed as onerous

16      and inefficient even before the pandemic.

17                 And for the time being, the on-demand

18      Access-A-Ride pilot has continued without caps on

19      rides or fees. However, we remain deeply

20      concerned that not enough riders have access to

21      on-demand dispatch technology, which should be

22      widely available and that restrictive caps and

23      fees may very well be implemented by the MTA in

24      the future. And finally, extensive wait times

2       between consecutive rides on Access-A-Ride have

3       been eliminated or reduced.

4                   However, my experience is that Access-A-

5       Ride is still often making customers wait an hour

6       or more for rides, and during a pandemic that

7       feels particularly unsafe, as we often have to

8       wait in lobbies, entry ways to buildings and

9       other places where social distancing isn't

10      possible.

11                  I experienced it myself when I had

12      several doctors' appointments in multiple

13      boroughs last week and needed safe and fast rides

14      to get me where I needed to go. Everything else

15      seemed to be in place, which made for a safe,

16      reliable and affordable ride all day.

17                  This may surprise some people who have

18      heard me testify at the monthly MTA board

19      meetings, but it made a huge difference to my day

20      to make it all work better. Because some of my

21      appointments changed, I used a combination of

22      broker service and on-demand service which made

23      it easier, faster, safer and quicker. I wouldn't

24      be able to do that if the MTA were to go ahead

2       with a plan to reduce the on-demand service,

3       especially once it's safe to start going to

4       offices again.

5                  The Access-A-Ride program, the MTA and

6       the City and the state have a responsibility to

7       make sure people with disabilities aren't

8       forgotten or ignored during this crisis. And

9       because of the ADA, this is also the law. The

10      communities that are most in need, it's our job

11      to make sure that these communities' needs are

12      met.

13                 We also want to recognize that many

14      elected officials, and thank you again, as well

15      as transit riders and workers around the city,

16      state and country are now begging Washington

17      literally for the federal funding needed to save

18      transit, and we share this sense of urgency and

19      thank all of you for your efforts to save the

20      MTA.

21                 We know the transit agency desperately

22      needs that money, including Access-A-Ride. For

23      these services to be cut or discontinued would be

24      devastating for people with disabilities who rely

2       on accessible transit and paratransit to get to

3       healthcare appointments, jobs and to live our

4       lives. I don't want to think about what would

5       happen if people are cut off from transit. I've

6       experienced enough death in my life and that is

7       ramped up during COVID-19 among my close friends.

8       We need to take all of this seriously. Our lives

9       depend on it, including mine. Thank you very

10      much.

2                  Thank you for to your service to New

3       York State during the COVID-19 pandemic. I

4       appreciate the opportunity to testify before you

5       today on the unprecedented challenges facing New

6       York's MTA. Though overall ridership is down, New

7       York City has depended on buses and subways

8       throughout the pandemic. Essential workers

9       continue to rely on transit as they provide

10      medical care, stock grocery shelves and keep

11      basic services like utilities running.

12                 Bus service should be distributed to

13      meet the needs of these workers and prevent

14      crowding onboard. However, new data from transit

15      app shows crowding is more concentrated on bus

16      lines in lower-income and black and brown

17      communities, where large numbers of essential

18      workers live. The BX3 route, which travels

19      through the Bronx and Upper Manhattan and the B35

20      route between Brooklyn's Brownsville and Sunset

21      Park neighborhoods, for instance, appear to be

22      more crowded than lines serving more affluent

23      areas of the city.

24                 Transit Center has urged the MTA to



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       address the inequities of bus crowding by

3       reallocating service from low ridership routes to

4       high ridership routes. Members of the legislature

5       can help by pressing the MTA to revise schedules

6       each month and reallocate services to meet the

7       needs of black, brown and low-income New Yorkers.

8                  Transit Center also has called on the

9       MTA to set objective benchmarks that will trigger

10      a return of late night subway service. For

11      instance, the number of consecutive weeks with

12      the positivity rate below one percent.

13                 Now I'd like to discuss the n MTA's

14      five-year capital program, a historic and hard-

15      fought investment in our region's transit system.

16      While New York rightly focuses on the short-term

17      dangers posed by the virus, we must also remember

18      the serious long-term problems plaguing our

19      transit infrastructure. The signal system is

20      ancient and failure prone. Hundreds of stations

21      lack access for people with disabilities. Subway

22      cars that should have been retired long ago are

23      still pressed into service.

24                 Failure to address these problems will



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       have devastating long-term impacts on the region

3       and will exacerbate inequities among our

4       neighborhoods. The consequences of unreliable,

5       inaccessible subways are felt most acutely by New

6       Yorkers who do not have the means to live close

7       to Manhattan. Riders with low incomes tend to

8       lose more times to delays than affluent riders,

9       and accessible subway stations are scarcer in

10      neighborhoods with more affordable rents.

11                 Given the practical limits on the

12      authority's spending due to COVID-19, the MTA

13      must make every effort to complete maintenance

14      work and capital upgrades at costs competitive

15      with peer agencies. The MTA can stretch capital

16      funds farther through the following two measures.

17      First, tight fiscal constraints will make the

18      need to prioritize projects within the capital

19      program even greater. We urge the MTA and state

20      officials to shift focus from expansion projects

21      like the Second Avenue Subway toward investments

22      that serve the many essential workers who

23      continue to rely on transit today. Core track and

24      station maintenance, signal modernization and

2       accessibility upgrades to the existing system

3       must be the top spending priorities.

4                  Second, the MTA should review transit

5       capital costs from other large cities with old

6       rail networks and use industry averages as

7       benchmarks to assess its own progress on cost

8       reduction. Benchmarking based on construction

9       costs of older transit networks in cities in

10      North America and Western Europe will help reveal

11      which MTA practices are out of line with its

12      peers and must be altered.

13                 Under Janno Lieber, president of MTA

14      construction and development, the MTA has

15      identified a number of project management and

16      procurement reforms to increase efficiencies. For

17      example, by bundling projects to take advantage

18      of track outages and we commend these steps and

19      believe they have the potential to reduce

20      construction costs. Making cost control goals

21      highly visible to the public will strengthen the

22      MTA's case for politically challenging decisions,

23      like shutting down segments of track continuously

24      instead of drawn out night and weekend work.

2                  An effective model is the MTA's on

3       practice of reporting performance targets for

4       subway and bus service. There are no equivalent

5       targets or metrics for MTA construction costs.

6       Setting firm public goals for cost control is an

7       essential step toward building trust in the MTA.

8       Now we understand that none of this will be

9       possible without a federal rescue of our transit

10      system. That's why we urge the legislature to

11      play an active role in demanding the federal

12      government deliver adequate resources to keep our

13      transit system running and to move stalled

14      congestion pricing approvals forward.

15                 If fare hikes or cuts to the capital

16      program become necessary, we ask the legislature

17      to work with the MTA on a robust public process

18      and to hold a hearing next fall to assess the

19      ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the agency's

20      ability to maintain the system's core

21      infrastructure. Thank you for the opportunity to

5       CAMPAIGN:      Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Hold on.

6       I'm going to pull up my testimony. So hello, good

7       afternoon, my name is Kwacey Coggins. I am a

8       member of the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign and

9       I'm an essential worker. Thank you for inviting

10      me to testify today. I'll be sharing my

11      experiences as an essential worker and a bus

12      rider this year.

13                  During the pandemic, I have worked as an

14      essential employee at a large retail store in

15      several locations across Queens and Long Island.

16      I have been depending on many different bus

17      routes, the Q44, the Q20 A and B, the Q42 and 83,

18      as well as the e-train and the Long Island Rail

19      Road to get me to and from work as safely and

20      timely as possible.

21                  I am speaking today on behalf of the

22      essential workers across the city, because we

23      deserve better service regardless, but especially

24      now. Essential workers are the people who have

2       kept New York City going during this difficult

3       time. In New York over 840,000 essential workers,

4       particularly depend on transit for their

5       commutes.

6                   I have regularly taken the Q44 every day

7       with local hospital staff on an overcrowded bus.

8       Working during the pandemic has been stressful

9       and scary. But what made the experience worse was

10      bus service. I cannot depend on it. During these

11      times, these buses have been as slow and

12      unreliable as ever. I have been late to work

13      several times because slow and inconsistent buses

14      initially, as many routes were chronically

15      overcrowded because of the pandemic, with bus

16      ridership returning faster than subway service to

17      about 60 percent.

18                  My bus routes are again, packed and

19      making the social distancing I practice the rest

20      of my day impossible during my commute. When I

21      was working in downtown Flushing, commuting from

22      Jamaica, it was awful to get to Flushing. I would

23      take two buses with a transfer in between, which

24      is trouble because a double bus driver is a

2       double liable on my trip. The first leg of the

3       trip is into downtown Jamaica on the Q42 or the

5       lucky not to miss them since they're functioning

6       at three independent routes. If they all come at

7       the same time, it can be 20 minutes or more until

8       the next one. From downtown Jamaica, I would

9       transfer to either the Q44 or the 20. The 44 is a

10      select bus route that gets me to Flushing faster

11      than 30 percent during the worst of the pandemic.

12      But there are times when I have waited half an

13      hour for it to arrive. Other times, I just give

14      up and take the local, the local up to get off at

15      the Q20.

16                 Throughout that means, I am for a long

17      ride. Hopefully I brought a book. The commute was

18      bad, but it was even worse to hearing from

19      management, you're late. Managers where I work

20      must write you up. Employees must

21      [unintelligible] [03:45:29] for being late more

22      than three times and they fire you. In this

23      economy I can't afford to get fired, which means

24      I cannot afford to be late.

2                  Sometimes I work overnight and it is

3       difficult to get home. I had to pay many times to

4       Uber home from work because the buses, the bus

5       did not show up. I can't I pay for one every day.

6       I know that MTA has recently cut overnight

7       service, subway service, while I take the bus to

8       work. I know that people who work overnight

9       shifts, who have faced the same complications

10      I've had to with my bosses.

11                 Every time I get to work late, I risk

12      losing my job during the pandemic. With the

13      unstable economy and all the risks I'm taking

14      just going to work, I shouldn't have to worry

15      about losing my job or losing my income because

16      of unreliable bus service. With a third of the

17      New York City workforce facing unemployment, we

18      cannot allow New Yorker use jobs due to poor

19      transit service. Service cuts and fare hikes

20      would be devastating to those like me who

21      continue to travel to jobs and help reopen the

22      city each day.

23                 New York City cannot recover if

24      essential workers cannot get where we need to go.

2       We need the state to make sure the MTA has the

3       money it needs to not only keep service running

4       but improve it. The MTA should bring back

5       overnight service as soon as possible or let

6       riders know when it plans to do so.

7                  We also ask that the state ensure the

8       MTA does not raise fares on riders, especially

9       when so many New Yorkers are unemployed, or

10      struggling to pay for MetroCard.

11                 And finally, the MTA should make sure

12      that they are making mask wearing easier choice

13      of riders by keeping mask vendors full. Essential

14      workers are the people who have kept New York

15      City going during this difficult time, and I am

16      speaking today on behalf of essential workers

17      across the city who deserve better service now

18      more than ever. Thank you for your time, and have

19      a nice day.

3       Transportation and Corporations, Authorities and

4       Commissions. My name is Rachel Foss. I'm the

5       senior research analyst for Reinvent Albany. We

6       advocate for more transparent and accountable

7       stage government including for authorities like

8       the MTA.

9                   First, we want to thank you for holdings

10      this oversight hearing on the MTA and the

11      financial impact and operational impacts of

12      COVID-19. We strongly support increased oversight

13      by the legislature, particularly in times when

14      state government is acting in an emergency

15      capacity.

16                  And we ask that you hold an additional

17      hearing this fall on the MTA, ideally in

18      November. This oversight will be important prior

19      to the MTA's release of a November financial plan

20      and adoption of a '20-'21 budget in December,

21      given its dire financial condition. It will also

22      ensure there's greater public transparency and

23      opportunity for comment on the potential fate of

24      the 2020-'24 capital program, which is currently

2       on pause.

3                   These are difficult sometimes for the

4       MTA and all New Yorkers and we are fully

5       cognizant of the political difficulty that the

6       MTA faces in providing information about

7       scenarios that are likely if federal funding does

8       not fully make up for their deficit. Therefore,

9       the state legislature has the responsibility to

10      riders and taxpayers to ensure that the MTA and

11      those it serves come out of this crisis as

12      unscathed as possible.

13                  The MTA's financial crisis is of a

14      magnitude never experienced before and comes at a

15      time when the MTA was already on precarious

16      financial footing. Its debt services reached

17      record levels, nearly 20 percent of operating

18      revenues before COVID hit, and the massive drop

19      in fare revenue and tax receipts means now that

20      the MTA is losing $2 million a week. Any options

21      for addressing the MTA's deficit must learn from

22      the past and ensure that riders in future years

23      aren't suffering under a transit system so

24      saddled with debt, it can't maintain service or a

2       states of good repair.

3                  The only option that will not create

4       devastating consequences for riders remains

5       Congress providing a massive infusion of

6       emergency aid of more than $10 billion.

7                  My written testimony has more detail on

8       the following items, which I'll summarize for

9       you. First federal funding for the MTA would

10      benefit not only the New York City region, but

11      the nation as whole, as MTA spending creates jobs

12      across the United States. I encourage to you look

13      at our report, "Investing in the MTA is Investing

14      in America", if you've not done yet, it's on our

15      website and in my written testimony.

16                 Second, deficit borrowing is a last

17      resort option for the MTA, given it is huge debt

18      loads, it's nearly $2.8 billion in 2020 alone for

19      debt service payments. Debt service will reach 26

20      percent of operating revenues next year. This is

21      up from 11 percent in 2004. And large amounts of

22      additional debt could cripple the system's

23      future.

24                 Also on MTA debt, we recommend that the



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       Federal Reserve's municipal liquidity facility

3       program, which we had heard from MTA today that's

4       that they tapped at a limited level, this could

5       be improved further with zero or very low

6       interest rates and longer-term borrowing. This

7       would make any small amount of borrowing by the

8       MTA more feasible. I know Bob Foran mentioned

9       that they saved $12 million versus what they

10      would have on the public markets. If the program

11      were improved further, they could save even more

12      money.

13                   And second, the legislature should

14      require an independent debt affordability study

15      conducted by the state comptroller to determine

16      the true red line for MTA debt. Third, MTA

17      dedicated funds must be protected from raids.

18      Part of the $12 billion deficit stated by the MTA

19      and the governor would include $600 million in

20      reductions by the state if federal funding does

21      not come through for New York State as a whole.

22                   This raid, if advanced could be rejected

23      by the legislature through the state budget

24      adjustment process and we also call on the

2       legislature to lockbox mass transportation

3       operating assistance funds. These are for the MTA

4       and transit systems across the state by moving

5       them off budget and no longer subject to

6       appropriation. This was done for the payroll

7       mobility tax and other MTA in 2018 and 2019, and

8       as you know, the congestion pricing is lockboxed

9       as well.

10                 In moving some of these funds off

11      budget, the division of the budget even said the

12      following, it will remove the state's unnecessary

13      involvement as a recipient of these funds and

14      accelerate the availability of these funds. We

15      think there's no reason that this should not also

16      be applied to the MTA's largest source of

17      dedicated funds, MTOA.

18                 And lastly, the MTA should look further

19      at opportunities for sharing crowding and

20      cleaning information as open data. This would

21      help build greater trust to the public as if they

22      can see the information themselves, they will

23      have more confidence making decisions about

24      riding subways.

2                  And lastly I'd like to say that we

3       support Senator Comrie's request for a full list

4       of COVID-19 emergency contracts with the MTA.

5       This should be released publically as open data

6       to not just the legislature but the public at

7       large, along with all MTA contracts.

2       for holding this hearing today. It's been really

3       informative.

4                   We also greatly appreciate you outreach

5       to the New York Congressional delegation in

6       support of additional federal funds for the MTA

7       and its millions of riders through the end of

8       2021. As you've heard extensively this morning

9       and will hear more this afternoon, the MTA is the

10      most dire fiscal situation it's ever faced. The

11      agency is literally going broke helping move New

12      York.

13                  Without another infusion of emergency

14      federal funding, the MTA will be forced to make

15      difficult choices including deep service cuts,

16      reduced cleaning, fare increases, harmful layoffs

17      and a significant reduction in the MTA's capital

18      program. Without this critical federal funding,

19      the transit system has the potential to down

20      slide into a death spiral from which it could

21      take years, even decades to come back and riders

22      will be the biggest losers.

23                  Pandemic and emergent work from home

24      efforts have changed commute patterns maybe for a



                                Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       year, maybe forever. A survey by Partnership for

3       New York indicates that only 26 percent of

4       employees are expected to return to the office by

5       the end of the year, 83 percent of them will rely

6       on public transit. That means there must be safe

7       and sufficient service to get people where they

8       need to go when they need to get there.

9                  Clearly, given the lack of federal

10      responsiveness, it's time to look under every

11      couch cushion to find every available dollar to

12      spare riders in our region from a very bleak. We

13      have some thoughts on a mix of funding

14      possibilities and ask for your support in

15      exploring these avenues, more of which are

16      detailed in the written testimony we submitted.

17                 We understand that there may be tens of

18      millions of dollars available legislature set

19      aside funding, also known as CPRP money for

20      capital projects. While that won't fill the

21      congestion pricing hole, it could help advance

22      important projects. We're asking you work with

23      the MTA to identify key projects from a

24      reasonable regional perspective.

2                  It's time to revisit potential dedicated

3       operating revenue sources, as unappetizing as

4       that may be. MTA board member and our chair,

5       Andrew Albert is on record of in support of

6       raising the gas tax and our MNRCC and LIRRCC

7       chairs agree. We support a 15 to 20-cent per

8       gallon gas tax increase which could be phased out

9       or adjusted as other funding sources come back

10      online. Our back of the envelope tally indicates

11      in the gas tax doubled from eight cents to 16

12      cents, an additional $494 million a year would be

13      raised. If it's tripled from eight cents to 24

14      cents, an additional $988 million would be raise

15      raised.

16                 While we know that the City and State

17      are also hamstrung by lack of federal support, we

18      would like to see if there's a way that the $3

19      billion each in state and city funds could be

20      moved up in the cue to allow the capital program

21      and economic benefit it generates to commence.

22                 The MTA would also choose the

23      unappetizing route of going into more debt. Now,

24      it's generally not a good solution and we're not

2       sold on it now, but unfortunately it's it's a

3       reality that we could soon face.

4                    Making the MTA's financial and capital

5       project data available and usable in searchable

6       formats would help all of us better make the case

7       for funding now and into the future. Regular and

8       transparent reporting to the legislature could

9       spur the actions we've been calling for over the

10      years.

11                   I've been back to riding for months now.

12      And it's clear at that ridership is way down, but

13      starting to come back. The people are still

14      clearly concerned about catching the virus. The

15      MTA has taken significant efforts to clean and

16      disinfect trains and stations, but there's more

17      that it can do to convince riders it's safe to

18      return.

19                   Projects we're asking about include

20      expanding to subways and expediting on Metro-

21      North, real time alerts onboard trains and at

3       helpful.

4                    Additional rider friendly improvements

5       we'll be talking to them about include creating

6       an onboard cleaning dashboard with real time and

7       historical data by station, adding daily and

8       monthly ridership by route line, time of day and

9       station stops, including historical, aggregated

10      rider counts to the transit performance

11      dashboard, establishing the capacity of each

12      station and providing the percentage of capacity

13      reached in real time and making crowd source

14      crowding information for subways available for

15      real time.

16                   Thank you again for holding this

17      hearing. We'd like to see another in the fall

18      with updates. But would also like to echo the

19      call we heard about restoration of 24/7 subway

20      service. Thank you for your questions on that

21      today.

23      continue to need service at all hours and buses

2       and metrics rightly being the cornerstone of the

3       state's reopening, we urge similar publicly

4       disclosed metrics for restoration of overnight

5       service. We've heard reliably there are lines

6       outside some subway stations waiting for service

7       to begin again at 5:00 a.m. Since the majority of

8       overnight use has historically been between 4:00

9       and 5:00 a.m. we'd like to see a more immediate

10      metric-based option for rolling back closures to

11      restart service at 4:00. Anything you can do to

12      help move this forward is much appreciated.

13                 Of course, the surest and best way to

14      get all of the funding needed so that all of our

15      transit system needs can be addressed is to spur

16      the federal government to enact and to invest in

17      transit and its rider. Thank you.

18                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

19      much, and Danny.

22      you so much for having me, chairs and committee

23      members. And thanks so much for the MTA labor

2       appreciate everybody coming out on such a tough

3       occasion for such an important purpose and I want

4       to second what the folks here have said. I think

5       it's really, really important, all these points

6       have been made and they bear a lot of further

7       discussion and examination.

8                  I would start by where Lisa left off,

9       which is the urgent need for federal funding that

10      can't be overstated. Our biggest concern, I think

11      the biggest concern for New York and its future

12      should be the prospect of major fare hikes and

13      service cuts. They must be the absolute last

14      resort the of the MTA. We desperately need

15      federal funding to replace the funds lost to

16      COVID and if by catastrophe, the funds don't come

17      or they don't come soon enough, then every effort

18      needs to be taken to avoid fare hikes and service

19      cuts because they will do the most lasting

20      immediate damage to New Yorkers' livelihoods and

21      lasting damage to the city and to the state and

22      even really the national economy.

23                 And that's why everything must be done

24      to avert those to keep the transit system



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       running, to keep the millions of New York New

3       Yorkers in transit now moving forward in transit,

4       to make the system available to millions more who

5       will want to come back in the coming weeks,

6       months and over the next year.

7                  And really, the alternative transit is a

8       transit death spiral and our city, our region

9       really will ground to a halt. If that happens, we

10      are uniquely dependent on transit. That is one of

11      our struggles, being uniquely dependent on

12      transit American cities. But really, we are, you

13      know, our unparalleled vibrancy owes to the

14      density that transit supports and really, we

15      can't come back without it.

16                 More specifically, I guess, to hit a

17      couple of other points, congestion pricing is

18      something that cannot happen soon enough. We are

19      ready for it. We are more ready for it now than

20      before. That's why we so appreciate your

21      consideration, the last state budget seconding

22      support for congestion pricing. [unintelligible]

23      [04:01:34] to make it applicable to MTA

24      operations, MTA discussions with the federal

2       government, expedite it in any way possible,

3       either via administrative or legislative routes.

4                  And when it does happen and when it come

5       back it New York, it's incredibly important there

6       be no new exemptions. Congestion pricing is

7       robust and fair as it was written to the last

8       year's state budget. It must be implemented the

9       same way. There should not be more carve outs.

10      They will make work less well and they will

11      undermine trust in the system and in the

12      government that backs it. So it must go forward.

13      It must go forward with no new exemptions.

14                 Moving forward to the capital plan the

15      congestion pricing will help fund. Given that the

16      capital plan is now on hold and that a new

17      program will have to be envisioned and put forth,

18      we agree with the process points that my

19      colleagues have made about the how to do that in

20      the light of day and with the participation of

21      riders. But we also believe that at the end of

22      the day, it must emphasize basic state of good

23      repair. We can't depend on subway signals from

24      the last greatest crisis of the city's history



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       during the Great Depression. We can't depend on

3       subway cars that date to the 1960s. And of

4       course, we need to afford all New Yorkers the

5       dignity to the subway they can access. We need an

6       accessible transit system. And that something

7       that can only come through the MTA's capital

8       program that must be prioritized in the MTA's

9       capital program.

10                 So again, signals, subway cars,

11      elevators and ramps. That's what we need to bring

12      the subway back better than ever when we're able

13      to resume and reprioritize the capital program.

14                 And then lastly, I want to talk about

15      the service that riders need and the support that

16      riders need right now from the MTA, which is of

17      course transit service, right. It needs to be a

18      focus on the core of the MTA's basic operations.

19      That starts with 24/7 service. Overnight

20      commuters have punishing commutes already, that

21      we've taken away their subway option is

22      devastating to them. It doesn't matter if it's

23      one percent or two percent, it's tens of

24      thousands of New Yorkers. Essential workers by

2       and large, [unintelligible] [04:03:36] need to

3       get to work as easily and quickly as possible. we

4       owe them subway service. We must bring subway

5       service back. If you seen from the transit app

6       data that reported in The Daily News that bus

7       service is dramatically unequal across the city.

8       The heaviest ridership buses are experiencing the

9       worst crowding, and you have buses running empty

10      across Central Park in the middle of the day.

11      There must be service reallocation. It's the

12      equitable thing to do, it is essential for racial

13      justice in the City. We must see that happen

14      soon. The MTA must embrace it. They will be

15      elevated, supported, rewarded for doing that.

16                 And then, finally, and I'll just touch

17      on this very, very briefly. There is money in the

18      MTA budget for MTA police to police subway and

19      riders. We think that money needs to be spent on

20      service. We need as much service as possible.

21      That's the way to keep New Yorkers safe, that's

22      the way to build an equitable recovery. Thank you

23      so much.

2       Danny. Is that all the speakers for this panel? I

3       believe it is.

4                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Yes, I think

5       so.

6                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               Let me start by making

7       a statement, thanking each and every one of you

8       individually and the organizations that you

9       represent. I think in the last what would it be,

10      20 months we have made extraordinary strides in

11      the MTA system and that has been system wide,

12      from the tip of Long Island all the way up to the

13      highest peak of Metro-North and of course in

14      through the great City of New York.

15                 And we would not haven't able to

16      accomplish what we have without all of your

17      input, energy and support and advocacy, quite

18      frankly and we are very much reliant upon all of

19      your work in helping to inform us on where we

20      take it from here. This is no different. So thank

21      you all for participating in today's public

22      hearing. This is very important information that

23      you've all shared.

24                 And I think each of you touched on

2       various aspects of things that we've heard

3       already, whether it was from the administration

4       and questions that our colleagues had brought up,

5       to the leadership of the labor organizations

6       representing the thousands of workers on the

7       frontlines, making the system run. You brought up

8       some critical points. Also, the congestion

9       pricing plan, the implementation of the

10      congestion pricing plan, the focus on expanding

11      the capital plan, ensuring that the system has

12      the funding from the federal government, as well

13      and what do we do until then.

14                 So these are all important points that

15      you have all brought up and I'm just very

16      grateful for all of your efforts. So again, thank

17      you so much.

18                 Two quick things I want to throw out

19      there. Anybody feel free to chime in. I know

20      Danny, you even alluded to it, but others have as

21      well, on the importance of restoring that 24/7

22      service. Right now, there is a gap in service

23      between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. It's to clean the

24      cars. I brought it up earlier with the MTA



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       leadership. They spoke to that point. I want to

3       hear about the impact it's having on the ground

4       with the ridership.

5                  And also, regarding the Access-A-Ride

6       and the accessibility I know that the testimony

7       we were going to save until later on in the

8       further panel discussion that came forward

9       regarding Access-A-Ride. The state legislature

10      passed legislation extending the Access-A-Ride

11      accessibility and eligibility, especially for the

12      remote areas for those appointments and whatnot.

13      That legislation was vetoed, and it was done so

14      based upon the information that we got from the

15      administration, from the MTA saying that it was

16      redundant. So I'd like to hear if there were any

17      comments on that as well.

18                 I think each and every one of us has

19      been focused on making sure that we are not only

20      getting the system up to where it should be,

21      where we're 30 years past due with the Americans

22      with Disabilities Act and making sure we have

23      that accessibility for all riders. But at the

24      same time, what can we do with the technological

2       advancements that are available to us today to

3       achieve those same goals? So I'll throw those two

4       ideas out to you, and again are thank you all for

5       taking part in this today.

6                  MR. WOOD:          Thank you, senator. I could

7       start really quickly on the issue of Access-A-

8       Ride. Just to reiterate, we really appreciate the

9       legislature and everyone here and Senator Comrie

10      and Assembly Member Dinowitz for initially

11      sponsoring those bills that would have extended

12      all of these protections, which we do acknowledge

13      the MTA has done a good job of implementing. But

14      we were disappointed in the veto, obviously. We

15      would like those protections to be extended in

16      state law to Access-A-Ride users.

17                 We also think there's a lot of win-wins

18      in there that we continually reach out to MTA and

19      Access-A-Ride leadership about, with things like

20      reducing in-person assessments. There are cost

21      efficiencies there as well as eliminating onerous

22      requirements on people with disabilities. And we

23      want to continue to look from win-wins. Things

24      like using taxis and on-demand dispatch



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       technology can also be really be win-wins in

3       terms of reducing the high cost of the system,

4       while making it more responsive and bringing it

5       into the year 2020 in terms of the technology.

6                  So we were disappointed in the veto, but

7       we think it was really important that the

8       legislature passed those bills unanimously and we

9       got a veto statement that really reiterated a

10      commitment to these safety measures. And so we

11      really hope to keep working with all of you and

12      your committees to still push for innovation and

13      real reform in the paritransit system statewide.

14                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you.

15                 MR. WRIGHT:           I was just going to jump in

16      for the one part of that question. There are a

17      number of tools that the MTA, once construction

18      picks up again. There are a number of tools they

19      could employ to bring down the cost of some of

20      these projects. Transit Center has been out and

21      open on the record with a few of those, including

22      elevators that go directly from the street to the

23      platform, a new policy that is being shopped

24      around to local elected officials in New York

2       City that would change zoning law to take

3       advantage of development that's happening within

4       the city to have developers make various

5       concessions to the MTA in order to provide access

6       through their buildings to subway stations. That

7       would tremendously reduce the cost of certain

8       elevator projects within the city. So there

9       definitely are ways that the MTA could bring down

10      the cost of projects.

11                 And I also want to comment on your

12      question about the effect of the late night

13      closures on riders. And I'm sure that my

14      colleagues will have more to say on this. But

15      I've heard personally from riders who are --

16      people that, the one percent that Chair Foye has

17      mentioned, the 10,000 plus people who rely on the

18      subway system during that time, these are people

19      late night shift workers, who are cleaning

20      hospitals, providing medical care late night,

21      really keeping the lights on in New York City.

22                 And without adequate subway service and

23      adequate bus service to pick up the slack and now

24      with the cancellation of the MTA's overnight for

2       hire vehicle program, there are a lot of people

3       who are literally stranded and unable to find

4       adequate means of transportation and the MTA is

5       leaving them to fend for themselves.

6                  So what we have called for at least for

7       the MTA to, and Governor Cuomo, to articulate a

8       series of objective measurements that would

9       trigger the return of late night service. We

10      think gyms have objective measures that are

11      triggering the return of gyms. We think that the

12      same is possible for the subway as well.

13                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you very much.

14      I'll yield back to you.

15                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Oh, I didn't

16      know if you had another moment to just comment op

17      24/7 service or do we need to move on?

18                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Absolutely. Go ahead,

19      Lisa, and then we'll pass it back over to the

20      assemblywoman.

21                 MS. DAGLIAN:            Thank you. We have, since

22      the announcement in May that overnight service

23      was going to stop, been asking for information

24      about how long it takes to clean stations and

2       subway cars. That's reasonable information to

3       look at. How long it takes to get homeless from

4       the system to the help that they need. We have

5       not yet received that information from the MTA.

6       Those we think would be very helpful, that would

7       be very helpful in determining and helping to set

8       the metrics of what is needed for

9       [unintelligible] [04:12:59] so that it could be

10      shrunk or revised or at least looking to the

11      future, what is going to be, how we're going to

12      be able to restore 24/7 service from a metric-

13      based fashion.

14                 And I think that looking, gathering some

15      of that information would be helpful not just for

16      preparing for future emergencies and looking to

17      see what the costs and effects are going to be in

18      terms of cleaning and homeless and getting

19      homeless the help that they need but looking at

20      this restoration. And when I was out handing out

21      masks at subway stations and on the mask patrol,

22      I was told firsthand about people who wait in

23      line 5:00 o'clock in the morning to get into the

24      subways because they need to be work by 6:00 or

2       by 5:30 and there's literally no other way for

3       them to get there, since it's too short a

4       distance back when the essential service

5       connector was running and they don't have a bus

6       near them.

7                  So, looking at, taking all of that

8       information, listening to some of the anecdotals,

9       listening to what some of the labor folks said

10      about ways that their members could contribute to

11      the conversation, I think gathering as much

12      information as possible to be informed and to be

13      cautiously appropriate in reopening or rolling

14      back closures is really necessary. So thank you.

15                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you.

16                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you,

17      both. So I have a couple of questions. First, let

18      me start out by saying thank you to everyone who

19      testified on this panel. You have been such

20      teachers to me, in my years now as corporations

21      chair, on this issue in particular so I really

22      appreciate that. You know, you more than any

23      other group of citizens outside of the workers

24      and the administration, follow the transit

2       system. That's your mission as advocates. And so,

3       I wanted to just ask you some real general

4       questions. What do you think we should be doing?

5       I know you're saying we should have another

6       hearing in the fall. What else should the

7       legislature be doing at this point, what should

8       we be doing as the oversight committees for the

9       MTA? Is there anything you can think of in terms

10      of a more active role for us, question number

11      one?

12                 And, two, what should the MTA be doing

13      more actively than they are? What should the

14      unions be doing more actively than they are? From

15      your perspective, what can we do together to

16      make, or collectively make this horrible

17      situation a little better?

18                 MS. FAUSS:           I will start and I know my

19      colleagues will have more to say. Like I said at

20      the beginning of my testimony, we really

21      appreciate the hearings you have held and I think

22      they are extremely beneficial and that's why we

23      think another one this fall before any decisions

24      get made before the next year's budget will be



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       real, really important.

3                  There should be more clarity about the

4       federal funding situation in the next few months

5       or even if there still isn't, we're getting

6       closer to that time when the MTA is going to have

7       to adopt a budget. And I think your role in

8       probing and getting the right questions asked so

9       the public has an understanding of what's

10      happening and can weigh in is going to be really

11      important.

12                 The second thing I referenced in my

13      testimony, I'll just reiterate, is that you are

14      the stewards of the MTA state funds. They have a

15      number of dedicated funds and the legislature has

16      been I think doing a great job making sure to put

17      them in lockboxes like congestion pricing, the

18      internet sales tax, the mansion tax, moving the

19      PMT, payroll mobility tax off budget.

20                 I think it's time for the mass transit

21      operating fund to also be moved off budget, so

22      that it's protected in future processes. Because

23      the legislature can reject a cut to it that might

24      come to the state adjust process but it would be



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       better to have it go directly to the MTA. It'll

3       be more seamless and it won't be subject to the

4       political kind of negotiations. And I think it

5       would be extremely beneficial. So I would

6       encourage you to look at legislation to that

7       effect.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Anybody else?

9                  MR. WRIGHT:           Yes, I'll jump in as well.

10      Thank you for the question. I want to start off

11      by saying that I think we all commend the work

12      that of course that the MTA and the unions are

13      doing. I firsthand have seen the MTA passing out

14      masks. There is, I think, a very visible campaign

15      for riders to wear masks. And the evidence seems

16      to be that that's one of the most important

17      factors in being able to reopen and being able to

18      reopen as a city and also as a subway system.

19                 I'll just again reiterate, in my

20      testimony I think New York State, the

21      legislature, the governor, really needs to be on

22      the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure

23      that the approvals for congestion pricing move

24      through and do whatever you can to get the

2       federal funding that the MTA really needs.

3                  I know that that's not a very wonky or

4       policy-oriented question, but I think that right

5       now, if we could all be united as leaders in

6       calling for as much resources from the federal

7       government as the MTA needs, I think right now

8       that's task number one.

9                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. I

10      just have one other follow up. When it was

11      announced that there were going to be 500 new

12      transit police or whatever the number was, right,

13      everybody was almost unanimously as groups, you

14      didn't like it. And I wondered, if in light of

15      the mask issue that we heard today, the workers

16      don't want to be there with people who aren't

17      wearing masks. The riders don't want to be there

18      and it's perhaps causing ridership to be even

19      worse than it might be and might hurt increased

20      ridership in the future. Do you think there's

21      role there? I'm just asking the question. I know

22      Danny you spoke about trying to redirect that

23      money. But I'm just hearing everybody's testimony

24      today and wondered what you thought.

2                  MS. FAUSS:           I can speak for Reinvent

3       Albany. We still believe, we didn't support the

4       expansion at the time. We thought that a

5       reallocation and a better look at how the

6       existing NYPD police force was deployed would be

7       a far more cost-effective approach. There's 2,300

8       NYPD officers that patrol the subways. I think

9       that --

10                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    But what about

11      LIRR and Metro-North? We don't have any police

12      who do that.

13                 MS. FAUSS:           Well, I think there are 500

14      MTA police that are -- about 780 MTA police pre-

15      hiring of the new officers who were both bridges

16      and tunnels and Long Island Rail Road and Metro-

17      North dedicated. So I think that for us, the

18      question has been about the deployment of the

19      existing police force.

20                 And when you're looking at a more than

21      $10 billion deficit out through 2021, I think the

22      pause that's been putting on the hiring of

23      additional officers, there's been 170 officers

24      hired to date, I think given the huge deficit

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       coming in the future, additional hiring should

3       not be done at this time. That's our view. It's

4       best to look at the existing numbers that they

5       have, whether it's MTA working closely with NYPD

6       or looking at its current police force and

7       figuring out how to better deploy them in Metro-

8       North and Long Island Rail Road.

9                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you.

10      Anybody else?

11                 MS. DAGLIAN:            I wanted to go on the

12      record. We did not join the letters that my

13      colleagues regarding the 500 MTA police officers.

14      What we -- and I just wanted to clarify that and

15      why. What we called for was data driven

16      deployment. And data should be really the

17      cornerstone of all the efforts that the MTA is

18      making not just now, but pre-pandemic, post

19      pandemic in the work that it does.

20                 And so we don't know where the police

21      are that have been brought on. I think it was 130

22      have been hired. We've seen a decrease in mask

23      compliance. It's something that's not being

24      enforced and that's something that's I believe



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       statewide. And that was a decision made at many

3       different levels of government. So if there is

4       going to be a decision to increase or to

5       implement mask enforcement, mask compliance, then

6       I think there should be a lot of conversations

7       about how that's going to happen. Not just who is

8       going to do it but how it will be done with the

9       workforce that ends up doing it.

10                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you.

11                 MR. WRIGHT:           And just to add to my

12      colleagues' comments. The question of whether or

13      not to hire police officers is on pause now while

14      the MTA hiring freeze is in effect and Transit

15      Center agrees completely with Reinvent Albany's

16      assessment of the budgetary impacts of hiring 500

17      police officers.

18                 I will say the Transit Center also has

19      on the record given recommendations for how

20      transit police could be better utilized on the

21      subways and on the buses. We've called for

22      removing police from fare compliance on buses and

23      decriminalizing fare evasion. We think that the

24      MTA, especially as it moves to all door boarding

2       on buses with Omni should work with DAs to avoid

3       criminalizing New Yorkers, particularly black,

4       brown and low-income New Yorkers. And the MTA's

5       current eagle team, which is the name of the

6       transit police force that checks for fare evasion

7       on the buses, we think it should be overhauled to

8       include anti-bias and de-escalation principals

9       and really utilize more of customer service

10      approach than a criminalization approach.

11                 And to that end, Transit Center has seen

12      a growing number of cities across the United

13      States, joint increase the presence of unarmed

14      ambassadors on board to check for fare evasion

15      and other issues on board. We think that moving

16      toward a less punitive, less criminalizing

17      approach is the way to go here in New York City

18      right now.

3       advocating for is crisis response teams that

4       involve responses to mental health crises, other

5       than armed police officers, which has been a

6       highly successful model in other cities.

7                  And of course, in the transit system

8       there's a high likelihood of armed police

9       encountering people in mental health crisis and

15      piloted or introduced in the transit system,

16      among other things.

17                 And we've been working with the public

18      advocate in New York City and other local

19      legislators pushing for a pilot program in

20      starting with precincts that have a very high

21      rate of violent encounters between police and

22      folks in mental health crisis in New York City.

23                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you. All

24      right, with that now, turning back over to the

2       Senate. Thank you.

3                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. We don't

4       have anyone else that has any questions. I just

5       want to thank the panel for your continued

6       advocacy. And I would hope that you would keep it

7       up as the things that you mentioned are

8       important, that the public understand, and I

9       would hope you continue to engage the public,

10      especially in light of the fact that we need the

11      public to weigh in heavily on the issues that are

12      outstanding, and especially the need for the MTA

13      to go back to 24 hours.

14                 Also, the things that you mentioned

15      regarding revenue raising that the MTA can do and

16      budget cutting, we need the public to actually

17      advocate more on that as well. Honestly, I'm a

18      little dubious that we'll get any congestion

19      pricing money any time soon, especially in the

20      next six months. But even after that, with the

21      state of the world that we're in right now, you

22      know how much money we get from congestion

23      pricing is going to be subject to the state of

24      the world and unfortunately, it's not good.

2                  So I think we need to look at raising

3       more money internally, to maintain our capital

4       program, to readjust at that capital program. So

5       I wholeheartedly agree with you that we need to

6       have another hearing in the fall before they come

7       out with their capital update and I will advocate

8       with my chairs to make sure that happens because

9       I just don't see any progress on congestion

10      pricing between now and the end of year,

11      especially with this administration. There needs

12      to be some things that we need to be able do to

13      be self-sufficient within our own state and those

14      are hard decisions that we're all going to have

15      to make together.

16                 As far as the for-hire vehicle, and the

17      Access-A-Ride programs, I want you to thank you

18      for your support of the bills that you asked me

19      to sponsor and I'm happy to continue to advocate

20      for them and improve them, so we can eventually

21      get them passed. I think the Access-A-Ride

22      program should be a vehicle for-hire type of

23      program, once they improve the technology so that

24      those folks that are in most need of

2       transportation don't have to stand outside for

3       hours or be embarrassed if they come downstairs

4       or come out of a doctor's appointment late. So

5       it's a necessary upgrade that we need to do in a

6       for-hire vehicle program that is now disappearing

7       with a little help for those essential workers

8       from the 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. and that need to

9       be continued in some way, shape or form.

10                  So I want to thank you all for your

11      advocacy. I'm hope you're all testifying again

12      tomorrow. I look forward to continuing the work

13      with you in our state fight to try to make sure

14      that our transit system is as transparent as

15      possible.

16                  And also, that remind me, the questions

17      that you raised along with myself about the

18      transparency within the MTA is something that we

19      continue to have to push for. It's ridiculous

20      that this agency that is looking for billions of

21      dollars in assistance can't be as transparent as

22      we need to be on the legislature and everywhere

23      else. And as transparent as they're asking their

24      essential workers to be and their unions to be

2       with give backs, they have to be as transparent

3       as well to gain the public trust.

4                  So thank you all for your continued

5       advocacy. I look forward to working with all of

14      the Manhattan Institute?

15                 MS. NICOLE GELINAS, SENIOR FELLOW,

16      MANHATTAN INSTITUTE:             Good afternoon,

17      Assemblywoman Paulin, chairs Senator Kennedy,

18      Senator Comrie, thank you for inviting me to

19      testify this afternoon. COVID-19 is the biggest

20      threat to the downstate region's mass transit

21      system, and thus to the city itself since the

22      invention of the Model T. In the short-term, as

23      you heard this morning, the impact of the

24      pandemic on the MTA's ridership and finances far



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       surpassed the impact of previous crises.

3                  I'll give you just couple quick

4       examples. After September 11, 2001, for example,

5       the subway system lost two percent of its riders

6       until 2002. Ridership recovered and exceeded 2001

7       levels after just two years. After the 2008

8       financial crisis, the subway system lost three

9       percent of its riders because of the impact of

10      unemployment and fewer people commuting.

11      Ridership recovered and exceeded its 2008 levels

12      within three years. Similarly, after 9/11 and

13      after the 2008 financial crisis, the MTA lost

14      less than one percent of its passenger fare

15      revenue in the first instance and fare revenue

16      actually rose slightly after 2008.

17                 That was partly because of fare hikes in

18      those two years, but it speaks to the greater

19      capacity back then to increase fares with high

20      ridership versus capacity today. In fact, after

21      2008, the MTA's biggest program financially was

22      not a loss of riders or fares, but a substantial

23      loss in real estate related tax subsidies as the

24      housing bubble bust.

2                  So this time is very, very different. As

3       of last week, subway ridership remains three-

4       quarters below normal levels, commuter rail

5       ridership fares even worse, with Metro-North

6       ridership now down 81 percent, which speaks to

7       the fact that the white color workforce has not

8       returned in any substantial numbers to Midtown

9       Manhattan.

10                 Now, again, just reiterating what you

11      heard this morning, the MTA has never experienced

12      this type of substantial and prolonged drop in

13      its ridership. Although the MTA is already

14      planning for a fare hike for next year, no fare

15      hike can make up for this catastrophic loss in

16      revenue, as well as the historic loss in tax

17      subsidy revenues that you heard about this

18      morning. Now, that's the short-term picture.

19                 I'm not that worried that Congress won't

20      come through with another round of rescue funding

21      for the MTA. It is quite likely that Congress

22      will come through with more aid, either later

23      this year or early next year. It is the longer

24      term picture that that is frankly more worrisome.

2                  Although it's impossible to know for

3       sure, there's a real risk that the pandemic may

4       herald long-term pattern changes in white collar

5       working and commuting patterns. Before the

6       pandemic started, more than three-quarters of the

7       nearly four million people who commuted to core

8       Manhattan each day arrived on public

9       transportation. Most of those people, more than

10      two million people, came in every day on the

11      subways, most of the remainder came in on buses,

12      your commuter rail and a smaller amount on the

13      ferries.

14                 The pandemic has revealed that most

15      white collar workers can perform their job duties

16      as home, at least some of the time. And if you

17      think become back to some of the transit strikes

18      we've seen in the past, we had strike in 2005, a

19      strike in 1980 and a strike in 1966, white color

20      workers did everything possible to get to their

21      offices because they could not work at home.

22      Technology has reduced the white collar

23      dependence on the transit system and frankly

24      reduced the white collar dependence on the urban

2       environment itself.

3                  Now, that's not to say that white collar

4       workers will stay at home five days a week

5       forever. But is it a real risk that once the

6       pandemic is over they come into the office two

7       days a week or three days a week instead of five

8       days a week? Yes, that's a real risk and that

9       itself has a big impact on MTA finances when you

10      consider that more than half of transit riders

11      before the pandemic bought a monthly pass. That's

12      important revenue to MTA.

13                 So, what can we do and in fact this

14      situation is more like what happened after World

15      War II, getting back to the Model T comparison.

16      The mass marketing of the car after World War II,

17      up until now has been the greatest threat to the

18      transit system. And that indeed lowered transit

19      ridership for three decades after World War II,

20      until the MTA started to turn this around in the

21      late 1970s, early 1980s.

22                 So what can the state legislature, the

23      city government and other levels of government to

24      make a difficult recovery hopefully a little bit



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       less difficult? Yes, of course it's a given that

3       Congress should come through with this new money.

4       On the operating side, each MTA transit agency

5       should be proactively going to each of the union

6       bargaining units, ask the unions to come up with

7       clear, measurable cost savings through enhanced

8       productivity. The union members know the working

9       conditions and, you know, how to improve the work

10      flow better than anybody else. The unions can

11      bring these potential cost savings to the

12      management in order to avoid a wage freeze, in

13      order to avoid layoffs.

14                 On computer railroads, for example, we

15      could do cost savings by introducing some gated

16      fare entry, not having to check every single

17      passenger's ticket onboard commuter rail. On the

18      capital side, on all these construction projects,

19      to get more work done per scarce dollars spent,

20      the state legislature should consider revising

21      the prevailing wage laws for construction jobs to

22      allow the MTA's construction contractors to

23      eliminate duplicative construction jobs.

24                 In terms of new revenues, I think the

               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

1    Joint Hearing Impact of COVID-19 on MTA, 8-25-20

2       MTA should explain better what its strategy is to

3       overcome these supposed environmental review

4       delays in Washington. Is the MTA considering

5       suing the federal Department of Transportation

6       for example? Would the MTA consider going ahead

7       with the congesting pricing work and letting

8       itself be sued by the federal government and

9       arguing to a judge that the federal government's

10      delay is indeed a constructive answer that they

11      don't need to do an environmental review?

12                 But even if congestion pricing starts up

13      on time which it should, it is likely to bring in

14      less revenue than it would have without the

15      pandemic. In the short-term, in terms of fares

16      and toll hikes, toll hikes on the bridges and

17      tunnels are preferably to fare hikes on transit.

18      We don't want people to form a new habit of

19      driving into the city and also a fare hike

20      essentially right now is a tax on essential

21      workers.

22                 What we don't want to happen is white

23      collar workers gingerly coming back to the

24      transit system saying, you know what, I'll take

2       the railroad into the city, see happens and being

3       greeted with a slower commute, delayed trains, an

4       unpredictable commute, people not wearing masks

5       and then deciding, you know, I'm not going to do

6       this anymore. I will wait a few more months and

7       see what happens.

8                  And finally, I will say a quick word

9       about crime, although it's not in my prepared

10      remarks, because some of the previous panelists

11      talked about crime. Crime is indeed up

12      significantly on the subways over the past four

13      months, when you adjust for ridership and also in

14      some crime categories, just the raw numbers.

15                 We've had four murders on subway this is

16      year, all four murders were minority men. We

17      usually have two murders for an entire year on

18      the subways. And every rider is at five or six

19      times the risk of being robbed or assaulted

20      compared to last year. So crime is another

21      concern this terms of how do we get the ridership

22      back and how do we speed this difficult recovery

23      up.

11      Budget Commission. In the interest of time, I

12      will summarize my written remarks.

13                  It's clear that the MTA needs additional

14      federal assistance. However, as CBC noted in its

15      July report, the MTA must make its own hard

16      choices to solve its financial problems. The

17      choices will require shared sacrifices by all

18      constituencies, including the MTA must work with

19      the labor force to implement additional savings

20      by increasing the efficiency of operations,

21      reducing overtime and reducing personnel costs.

22      The MTA must forego new headcount. It simply

23      cannot afford new hires at this time.

24                  The MTA must also rescope the capital

2       program to focus on the projects that will

3       preserve the system's state of good repair and

4       reduce future maintenance expenses, especially in

5       the key areas of track and signals. The MTA must

6       also optimize service to match ridership patterns

7       and support critical needs of the economy. The

8       MTA should consider a revision of its essential

9       service plans to ensure that service enables the

10      ridership to maintain social distance guidelines

11      without running trains that are essentially

12      empty.

13                   Increasing tolls by a greater percentage

14      than the currently planned four percent increase

15      in 2021, given that toll traffic has returned at

16      a faster rate than ridership will help mitigate

17      some of the delays from congestion pricing and

18      also enable the MTA to address some of its

19      operating revenue gaps.

20                   However, the MTA has been given

21      authority to issue long-term debt to support its

22      operations, but this should not be considered

23      without taking all of the steps that I've

24      mentioned above to cut spending. Debt service is

2       paid through the MTA's fare and toll tax revenue

3       and subsidies. In 2020, debt service represented

4       19 percent of the MTA's operating revenues and

5       subsidies. In 2021, due to the pandemic's

6       effects, the MTA forecast this to grow to 26

7       percent. Thus, for every $5 of fare toll and tax

8       revenue the MTA receives, it will need to spend

9       more than $1.30 on debt service next year.

10                 With more revenue allocated to debt

11      service, fewer resources are available to enhance

12      service, keep trains and stations clean. Maintain

13      rolling stock or make other ongoing repairs that

14      are not capital eligible. Controlling debt

15      service growth once borrowing for operating

16      expenses is introduced will require

17      counterproductive reductions in capital

18      investments, risking the system's state of good

19      repair. Financial federal assistance aside, the

20      MTA should examine every aspect of its operations

21      and make the hard choices that will be necessary

22      to reduce spending and keep the system operating

23      until ridership returns and the economic activity

24      of the region rebound.

2                  The MTA has come too far in recent

3       decades to sacrifice its future to short-term

4       decisions that is will have long-term negative

11                 MS. RACHEL HAOT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,

12      TRANSIT INNOVATION PARTNERSHIP:                     Thank you,

13      Chairs Kennedy, Comrie and Paulin for hosting

14      this hearing on the future of the MTA in the wake

15      of the COVID-19 crisis. A modern and efficient

16      public transit system is essential to our city

17      and region's economic recovery and future growth.

18      The Partnership for New York City has actively

19      advocated for federal funding to fill the huge

20      revenue losses the system has experienced due to

21      the pandemic. But so far, only a quarter of what

22      is needed has been forthcoming. Without federal

23      action on the $12 billion the MTA says it needs

24      to get through 2021, there is no way the agency

2       can recover from what Chairman Foye has called a

3       fiscal tsunami.

4                  Prior to COVID-19, New York was on the

5       path to building a world class transportation

6       system after decades of decay and under

7       investment. Service, including on-time

8       performance was dramatically improving, capital

9       projects were being completed faster and at lower

10      cost and the MTA's historic $51.5 billion capital

11      program had just been approved.

12                 In 2018, the Partnership for New York

13      City and the MTA established the Transit

14      Innovation Partnership, incorporating private

15      sector expertise and cutting edge technology into

16      agency operations. Through this partnership, in

17      response to COVID-19, the MTA was quickly able to

18      deploy new technology to measure passenger flow

19      and reroute buses to accommodate frontline

20      workers during the hours the subway was closed.

21      In one example, it took just four days to launch

22      a solution that could have years under prior

23      procedures.

24                 We have also recently launched the

2       COVID-19 response challenge to make transit safer

3       and to safeguard the health of the MTA's heroic

4       workforce and riders. Evaluators are currently

5       reviewing more than 190 submissions from vendors

6       across the globe. And this fall, those companies

7       with the most promising ideas will be selected

8       for pilot projects and potentially adoption.

9                  Earlier this month, the Partnership for

10      New York City conducted a survey of private

11      sector employers to determine when workers are

12      likely to return to the office and what factors

13      influenced the timing. The results show

14      substantial uncertainty about when to expect

15      Manhattan's one million office workers to return.

16      This is not because they like working remotely.

17      The top three reasons for not returning to the

18      office were concerns about the status of the

19      pandemic and availability of a vaccine, the

20      safety of mass transit and safe reopening of

21      schools and childcare facilities.

22                 As of mid-August, the survey revealed

23      that just eight percent of office workers had

24      returned to the workplace. Only 26 percent were

2       expected to return by the end of year and 54

3       percent by July of 2021. Notably, 83 percent of

4       office workers will depend on mass transit for

5       their commute. The pandemic cost the MTA 90

6       percent of its ridership and 40 percent of its

7       revenues. But the subway, bus and commuter rail

8       systems today are cleaner, safer and more

9       comfortable than ever.

10                 Yet, many members of the public remain

11      reticent to return, primarily due to lack of

12      trust in the self-discipline of their fellow

13      passengers wearing masks, social distancing and

14      staying home when sick. There is also a growing

15      issue of crime throughout the city, including in

16      and around transit stations, subways, buses and

17      trains. The governor's executive order requires

18      everyone, including those using mass transit to

19      wear face coverings. Restoring confidence in

20      transit may require the legislature to codify the

21      governor's executive order into state law to

22      require wearing masks covering mouth and nose on

23      transit and in stations, as well as stronger

24      enforcement through a combination of NYPD

2       presence, real time monitoring and tools for

3       reporting violations.

4                  The financial losses facing the MTA will

5       not be covered in the short term by returning

6       ridership. Operational and administrative reforms

7       are also necessary. The MTA has implemented some

8       already, like design build that help speed up the

9       pace of projects while lowering the cost. Other

10      needed reforms are suggested in the 2018 report

11      of Metropolitan Transportation Sustainability

12      Advisory Work Group.

13                 The MTA leadership and transit workers

14      have done an exceptional job of maintaining

15      services and responding to the COVID-19 crisis.

16      They deserve our thanks and support during the

17      recovery process. New Yorkers, both transit

18      riders and workers, must feel safe on transit or

19      our economic recovery will continue to lag. Thank

20      you very much.

21                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you very much,

23      informative testimony from each of you. You know,

2       panelists that came and testified before us have

3       helped to inform us to drive the agenda. You've

4       each alluded to it over the course of the last 20

5       months.

6                  We have seen an extraordinary investment

7       into the MTA. We've seen some reforms put in

8       place by the Democratic senate along with our

9       colleagues in the Assembly, signed into law by

10      the governor. And look, we are just getting

11      warmed up. We've got a long way to go. We've got

12      a lot of work to do. And we knew, prior to COVID-

13      19 hitting us and really undermining the economy

14      not only of the city and the state, but the

15      nation and the globe, that the MTA was in need of

16      getting the ridership back on to the trains and

17      the buses and to create a more robust and

18      efficient system.

19                 So we were on the path to that. The rug

20      was pulled out from underneath us. And we've just

21      got to get back to where we were and better. I am

22      definitely intrigued by everything that each of

23      you has brought to the table and have done to

24      help drive this agenda thus far.

2                  I'm curious to know if you've been

3       working with the MTA, if they have been open to

4       working with you. And what in fact you may

5       present to us to advance forward from a financial

6       perspective, given the dire circumstances at this

7       point in time. Obviously, we're waiting on the

8       federal government to move, but if the federal

9       government fail to move, especially in the next

10      several months here, we're going to have

11      decisions to make. Do you have any ideas from a

12      budgetary perspective on where we should start?

13                 MS. RICHARDSON:              I can start with that.

14      It's CBC's custom, when we're going to issue a

15      report about an agency, any particular agency

16      operations, to give a copy of the report to the

17      agency in advance. And so typically when we're

18      making recommendations or observations about

19      agency operations, we will do that and the MTA is

20      no different.

21                 At this point, I think given the

22      situation with the federal government and some of

23      it may come out at tomorrow's board meeting and

24      in the future, obviously, the MTA is going to

2       have to come forward with some significant

3       changes that they need to propose.

4                  And so the question will be, I think

5       Lisa Daglian alluded to it earlier is with the

6       changes that they propose, what data do they also

7       share to show the entire community, including

8       yourselves, how they reached these decisions,

9       because they are going to be difficult and people

10      will be affected. And the issue becomes, for

11      everybody, all riders, all constituencies, is the

12      MTA sharing the pain broadly, equitably, equally

13      given that we all have a stake in the future of

14      the MTA? We all have a stake in helping the MTA

15      solve this problem right now. So in a lot of

16      ways, it really is a partnership between the

17      civic community, the MTA's unions and the MTA

18      itself and you as well because you represent all

19      of your constituents.

20                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you, Denise. And

21      Rachel, you presented some dire statistics.

22      Unfortunately, these are statistics that we've

23      all heard before. And it calls into question the

24      financial viability and the future of the city of

2       New York. We have to save the city of New York

3       and it starts with robust and efficient public

4       transportation system that people trust in. And

5       you used that word trust. People have to trust

6       that when we get on the train and they utilize

7       the system that they're going to get where they

8       want to get efficiently, reliably and safely. And

9       that means including and especially their health.

10                 And so, what other steps do you believe

11      that the MTA should be taking to get people back

12      into the trains, back into the buses and

13      utilizing that system again and what

14      opportunities that we may have to improve from

15      where we are with this historically low

16      ridership?

17                 MS. HAOT:          Thank you, Chair Kennedy.

18      Yes, we work very closely with the MTA at the

19      Transit Innovation Partnership. I'll give a few

20      examples of where we've had direction from the

21      MTA on where they're looking to further explore

22      solutions related to COVID-19 response. As

23      mentioned, we've recently announced a COVID-19

24      response challenge that calls for technology



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       solutions from around the world that help to

3       combat COVID-19 in a number of ways. And this

4       includes both product and tools that eliminate

5       the virus or prevent its spread, as well as tools

6       for monitoring and getting to what you spoke

7       about, trust and allowing customers and riders to

8       have even more information, so that they can feel

9       more confident about their commutes. We were very

10      appreciative to see that there were more than 190

11      responses to that competition. And the areas of

12      interest were submitted and indicated directly by

13      our partners at the MTA, in addition to, I should

14      note, other transit agencies within the region.

15      We have since expanded the Transit Innovation

16      Partnership to include other transit systems

17      within the region, as they have shared

18      challenges.

19                 So some of those areas were indicated by

20      Chairman Foye in his earlier remarks, including

21      exploring technologies and tools that help to

22      eliminate contaminated aerosols within the

23      system, and of course we cast a very wide net

24      with our challenge statement and thus we also

2       welcome a range of different approaches,

3       including innovations in PPE and other digital

4       tools that can be used to understand and

5       encourage mask usage throughout the system.

6                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               That's great. Thank

7       you very much. I'll yield to you, assemblywoman.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

9       much. I fear that your dire predictions are all

10      too correct. Living in the suburbs, I can with

11      Metro-North at the lowest among all of the

12      transit systems, I can tell you that I don't see

13      my neighbors going back any time soon into New

14      York City. Not until, I mean even when there's a

15      vaccine, the comfort of home is just the comfort

16      of home. And with Zoom and other technologies, I

17      do think we're going to see a reduction, whether

18      it's going to be permanent or whether it's going

19      to be temporarily permanent is hard to tell.

20                 When the vibrancy of the city comes

21      back, there will be a desire to go to the city.

22      But I don't know if it's ever going to be exactly

23      the same, so, we will just -- that's probably

24      true for Queens, you know, senator, and Brooklyn

2       and Staten Island, Manhattan, you can almost walk

3       wherever. So we're going to have a big test in

4       front of us and an unknown in front of us. So I

5       don't really have questions. I just want to say I

6       appreciate your perspectives. It's what I'm

7       thinking about as well. We are going to have to

8       look at that road ahead very carefully and make

9       good decisions so that we maintain the transit

10      system as best we can. So, thank you, all. I'm

11      going to turn it over to Senator Comrie.

12                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you, Chair

13      Paulin, Assembly Member Paulin. I want to thank

14      the panel for testifying as well. They gave us

15      some clear insights into what we really know. I

16      know I can tell you that talking to friends of

17      mine that work in the banking industry, work in

18      the fashion industry, work in the even

19      architecture industry, that their jobs are

20      telling them that they're not coming back until

21      maybe June of next year, and that was the latest.

22                 Some people said maybe January. We

23      really know that people are not going to come

24      back until there's a city again, until there's

2       Broadway, until there are restaurants. You know,

3       corporate America is not coming back until there

4       is a vibrancy for them to come back to and that's

5       the reality that we all have to face one way or

6       another, and that we have to, the challenge is

7       for us to reunite the city, to reignite the life

8       blood of this city, which is the night life,

9       which is the theaters, which are the restaurants,

10      which is why corporation America wanted to be in

11      New York City in the first place. So that's a

12      challenge.

13                 I hope you all submitted your testimony.

14      I didn't get a chance to download it. If not,

15      could you please e-mail it to me directly? I hope

16      that you all are testifying tomorrow at the board

17      hearing as well and that you will continue to

18      advocate for your different positions. You talked

19      about, Denise, you talked about reducing the MTA

20      debt service and the fact that the MTA is

21      spending more and more money in debt service. Can

22      you talk about how you think the MTA, what best

23      proposals the MTA could do to reduce debt

24      service?

2                    MS. RICHARDON:              Well, you know, the last

3       several capital plans, it really started in the

4       late 1990s, have been overwhelmingly funded with

5       debt, and, you know, the '15 to '19 capital

6       program came with about $10 billion of debt, the

7       '20 to '24 capital program had what I'm going

8       call the debt that was to be supported by the

9       dedicated revenues of the mansion tax, the

10      internet sales tax and congestion pricing. But it

11      also came with over $9 billion of what I'm going

12      to call traditional debt backed by tolls and

13      fares.

14                   Clearly, to address the debt service

15      issue, the MTA is going to have to look at some

16      form of rescoping of the capital program in one

17      form or another. One of the things that has not

18      really been talked about that could benefit the

19      MTA is that the Federal FAST act, the MTA gets

20      about 25 percent of their capital funding through

21      the regular ongoing federal transportation bills.

22      The FAST Act is up for renewal. It's obviously

23      unlikely that that will happen between now and

24      the election, however, I'm sure that next year it



                                 Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
                 256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018
                                                    Page 271

2       will be probably front and center of the next

3       Congress.

4                   So the MTA, aside from the immediate

5       need for federal funding to resolve their

6       financial problems, the MTA will find itself with

7       a new infusion of capital funding which comes in

8       the form of direct grant from the next federal

9       transportation bill. That will help a lot.

10                  The other thing that the MTA really has

11      to avoid doing, as I mentioned, is to avoid at

12      all costs, borrowing for operating expenses

13      because that will put way too much pressure on

14      their debt service obligation. It is a little bit

15      concerning that their debt cap in the last budget

16      was raised from the $55 billion cap to $90

17      billion. But if you make the analogy to a credit

18      card, you have a limit on your credit card that

19      doesn't mean you spend it up to the limit.

20                  So I think what the MTA really has to do

21      is look at how to maximize their operating

22      efficiencies so that they don't start down the

23      path of borrowing for operating expenses and

24      looking at how they manage the capital program to

2       keep that debt service level and to keep that

3       debt service reasonable, and that may mean

4       stretching out the schedule for some projects.

5       Which at this stage, every business in the

6       country is looking at their changed financial

7       circumstances, and looking at how they need to

8       change their own investment patterns, and the MTA

9       needs to do that same thing.

10                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. So you

11      talked about the technology and the innovation of

12      technology and that there was a solution that you

13      resolved with the MTA in four days as opposed to

14      four years. Could you expound on what that was

15      and how that was helpful.

16                 MS. HAOT: Yes, thank you, Chair Comrie.

17      The Transit Tech Lab is a program that is run by

18      the Transit Innovation Partnership in

19      collaboration with the MTA, and it provides an

20      opportunity for the MTA to rapidly evaluate new

21      technologies that align with high priorities at

22      no cost, no financial cost. One of the examples

23      of our first Transit Tech Lab was a challenge

24      focused on how to predict and prevent subway



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       delays. And as part of this, a company called

3       Axon Vibe developed an app that was able to be

4       repurposed in a matter of four days to serve the

5       Essential Connector Program that was enacted when

6       the overnight subway closures were put into

7       place. Normally, in order to launch, develop and

8       integrate with data sources from the MTA, for

9       example, this would have taken much longer. But

10      thanks to a meaningful, deep working relationship

11      with the MTA, this team was able to rapidly

12      deploy this new app helping to indicate and

13      provide guidance to essential workers traveling

14      overnight the best path that they could use to

15      make their journeys.

16                 SENATOR COMRIE:              So this is the

17      Essential Connector Program that allowed people

18      that were working from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. to

19      find alternate means of transportation?

20                 MS. HAOT:          Yes, that's correct.

21                 SENATOR COMRIE:              And that program was

22      operational within four days. Do you think that's

23      a program that needs to continue?

24                 MS. HAOT:          I would defer to the MTA on



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       their direction for the program. The app,

3       however, like all technology, the benefit there

4       is that it can be repurposed to serve workers in

5       different ways, and so thankfully this is a tool

6       that integrates directly with MTA data feeds. It

7       continues to support overnight workers because it

8       provides information on, for example, overnight

9       bus routes that they are able to use. In addition

10      to that in the future it can be used to support

11      workers in transit deserts that are perhaps

12      further away from transit, so there is continuing

13      value in the tool regardless.

14                 SENATOR COMRIE:              That's why I'm

15      interested in it. I represent Southeast Queens,

16      which, as you know, they're one of the worst

17      transit deserts in the city. Thank you for that

18      feedback. I would hope that you would also

19      convince them to develop an app so that the

20      Access-a-Ride program could be app based and make

21      it a lot more technically efficient through

22      having an app-based program so that people could

23      not have to go through the horror show that they

24      do now with Access-A-Ride. So hopefully that can

2       be part of the new technology that's developed as

3       well.

4                   And maybe, as an offshoot of this

5       Essential Connector Program that you've already

6       been working on, I hope the MTA would embrace

7       that as quickly as possible. Thank you.

8                   Nicole, you talked about suing the

9       federal government for the congestion pricing and

10      taking them on and starting that. Do you think

11      that's actually feasible if the MTA is actually

12      looking to borrow $12 billion or get another $12

13      billion from the federal government? And how do

14      you juxtapose suing when we're asking for money?

15      Can you give me a balance on that?

16                  MS. GELINAS:            Yes, thank you, Senator

17      Comrie, for that excellent question. You know,

18      you are obviously much better at assessing the

19      congressional situation and the federal election

20      situation than I would be, but given that we

21      don't know the outcome of the election in

22      November, the faster we get this out of the

23      political arena and into the legal arena, with

24      very little downside, I think that some form of



                                Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
                256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       new rescue package in Congress will pass.

3       Realistically, that rescue package is going to

4       need votes from both sides of the aisle,

5       including our two New York senators who are

6       obviously very interested in the transit

7       situation. But were the MTA to sue or were they

8       to be sued over congestion pricing, it would at

9       least start a process where the federal

10      Department of Transportation, where the rest of

11      the federal government would have to answer in

12      court for what is the reason for these delays.

13                 Robert Moses used to say if a project is

14      going to generate revenue, you want that project

15      up and running as quickly as you can get it up

16      and running because you need to get those dollars

17      in sooner rather than later. Even if the MTA had

18      to spend money an environmental review, just a

19      couple days of congestion pricing would make up

20      for that extra spending, same thing with spending

21      money on the lawsuit.

22                 So I think it's at least worth

23      considering and worth asking the MTA have you

24      thought about this, have you thought about a



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       strategy if this continues indefinitely with this

3       supposed federal obstacle. New York State

4       obviously has a precedent in suing the federal

5       government over other issues, even as it needs

6       general aid during the pandemic, so just

7       something to think about.

8                  SENATOR COMRIE:              It's been an

9       interesting idea. I'll have to talk about it with

10      you some more, if you could send us the details

11      on that, as usual.

12                 MS. GELINAS:            Yes.

13                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Your three groups are

14      always innovative and forward thinking. I want to

15      thank you, Nicole Gelinas and Rachel Haot and

16      Denise Richardson for your continued advocacy on

17      behalf of the city. I hope that we can continue

18      to work together with you. I just wanted one

19      final question for the three of you. Do you think

20      that full transparency of all of the jobs and

21      positions and contracting at the MTA is necessary

22      to develop trust within the agency and with the

23      people that have to work with the agency? And if

24      so, can you express why?

2                   MS. RICHARDSON:              I'll start. I think

3       it's very important. You know, I think the MTA

4       has done a good job improving their capital

5       program dashboard, but a number of the earlier

6       speakers alluded to it earlier. They've had to do

7       a lot of emergency contracts to deal with the

8       pandemic, and that's right. However, the time has

9       come now to identify what that spending was on,

10      identify who the vendors were, and identify what

11      they've gotten from it.

12                  Also, I think the earlier panel talked

13      about some metrics on the cleaning, on ridership.

14      Those are important things for people to have,

15      particularly because if the MTA has to make the

16      decision to make some service changes, it's

17      always helpful to be able to go to the public and

18      say we're making this service change because, in

19      fact, for whatever this service is, we have in a

20      four-hour period, 30 riders, and here's how we

21      can accommodate these 30 riders in some other

22      form.

23                  To keep silent when you have to make

24      decisions that are going to affect people's lives

2       and not affect them in a way that is convenient,

3       I think makes it much harder to get public buy-

4       in. And for you, who are accountable to your

5       constituents, to then go back to your

6       constituents and say, look, we all have to work

7       together here. This is what we need to do. So I

8       think the more information that the MTA can give

9       in a thoughtful way that explains what they're

10      doing will be more helpful to everybody.

11                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you.

12                 MS. GELINAS:            I guess I'll go next. One

13      issue where the state legislature, I would

14      respectfully suggest might be helpful in

15      transparency is this issue of construction

16      contracts. Under the prevailing wage law, the

17      wage rates are obviously set under the law, but

18      the construction contracts between not the MTA

19      and the contractors, but between the contractors

20      and the construction unions, those are private

21      contracts. We are not allowed to look at the

22      terms of those contracts between the construction

23      contractors and the construction unions.

24                 Transparency is always a good thing or

2       almost always a good thing. Changing the state

3       law to say that anybody project that receives

4       state funding, such as all of the MTA capital

5       projects, those contracts must be public would be

6       a big start in improving transparency.

7                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Actually, I have a bill

8       to that, Nicole. It didn't get far last year,

9       we're going to try to do it again.

10                 MS. GELINAS:            Yes, I know. And that,

11      just because sometimes, frankly we are guessing

12      when it comes to what are the efficiencies on the

13      construction contract side because we have very

14      limited information.

15                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Right. Thank you.

16      Rachel, go ahead.

17                 MS. HAOT:          Hi. Thank you, Chair Comrie.

18      I would echo that we support full transparency,

19      and I would also point to the MTA taking a

20      positive step in that, along those lines prior to

21      the COVID pandemic, releasing the open data

22      budgetary platform online.

23                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. My colleague

24      asked me a question. Do you think it was



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       necessary for the MTA to engage McKinsey to do a

3       COVID-19 impact? Don't you think they could have

4       done it on their own or working with your group

5       to do that, as opposed to going back to McKinsey

6       for another costly study about what they already

7       know on the ground? Kind of a loaded question,

8       but I'm asking it anyway.

9                  MS. RICHARDSON:              I spent a lot of years

10      in government before I transitioned out. And, you

11      know, it used to be kind of a joke among the

12      government agency people, and it really doesn't

13      matter which agency. I worked in a lot of them

14      and it was always the same, is that there is a

15      natural tendency, and maybe it's human nature as

16      well, if you think about family dynamics as well,

17      that you tend to believe the opinion of the

18      outside expert than your own people. And so it

19      seems to be a natural tendency in organizations

20      to rely on the outside help.

21                 Do I personally think that the MTA had

22      the ability to do this analysis? Absolutely. And

23      I do think that one of the things that people

24      don't do often enough is recognize that the MTA



                               Geneva Worldwide, Inc.
               256 West 38 t h Street, 10 t h Floor, New York, NY 10018

2       is an agency of transportation professionals, and

3       they do know what they're doing, and they run the

4       largest transportation mass transit agency in the

5       country, and most days they do it pretty well.

6                    Obviously, if you're the rider on the

7       late service, you don't think so, but the reality

8       of it is, is that they do have a very

9       experienced, knowledgeable staff to who knows

10      their finances and knows their ridership patterns

11      inside and out.

12                   But again, it's very hard to break that

13      tendency to go to the experts who many times just

14      parrot back what the agency told them in the

15      first place to say. So, yes, there is an issue

16      there.

17                   SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. With that,

18      Nicole, did you want to answer that? Okay. Thank

19      you. I saw you went off mute. All right, well,

21      expertise and your focus on trying to save the

20      I'm vice president of the government affairs for

21      the Associated General Contractors of New York

22      State. We are the leading statewide trade

23      association representing New York's construction

2       AGC members perform the majority of public and

3       private transportation building and environmental

4       infrastructure work in every region of New York

5       State. Thank you for holding this important

6       hearing to discuss the impact COVID pandemic on

7       the MTA.

8                  Today's testimony will briefly touch on

9       the challenges of working safely during a

10      pandemic, the capital program for the MTA and

11      recommendations to improve the procurement

12      processes for contractors, subcontractors, and

13      material suppliers.

14                 From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,

15      Governor Cuomo's executive orders deemed most

16      construction as an essential business. The

17      members of AGC, which already had significant

18      experience applying rigorous safety standards and

19      utilizing PPE developed and honed a comprehensive

20      plan of best practices to mitigate health risk

21      for construction workers. The construction

22      industry, informed by that experience and driven

23      by our abiding multiple to safety, was

24      exceptionally well prepared to continue moving

2       the MTA capital program forward during the

3       pandemic.

4                   Guided by our history of safety,

5       education and training, AGC quickly developed

6       recommendations for the New York Forward region

7       reopening plans. Our proposals, three main points

8       of our proposal mandated that, one, all employees

9       must be trained in established safe practices,

10      they're required to follow all measures

11      implemented to protect the workforce from the

12      potential exposure of the coronavirus, two,

13      safety plans, individual safety plans, must be

14      maintained on each construction project, and

15      three, both training and safety plan procedures

16      must be continuously reevaluated and updated

17      based on the OSHA guidelines, CDC and New York

18      State department of health guidelines.

19                  So fast forward it to today, the

20      economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and

21      a stalled federal funding recovery agreement with

22      direct aid to public transportation has further

23      deteriorated the MTA's current and future

24      finances, jeopardizing critical transportation

2       services, jobs and the capital program.

3                  In the coming months and years the

4       legislature and governor will need to make many

5       difficult decisions to restore the fiscal

6       stability of the MTA. AGC continues the work with

7       the MTA and our New York State congressional

8       delegation to secure necessary funding to keep

9       the capital plan and operations on track.

10                 To date, AGC has held 15 congressional

11      town hall style meetings with the New York State

12      congressional delegation urging them to find a

13      bipartisan compromise for direct aid to the MTA

14      as well as direct aid to both state and local

15      governments. Furthermore AGC commends the

16      legislature for passing legislation to reform

17      some of the procurement processes of both state

18      agencies and authorities.

19                 In 2019, two bills were passed that

20      helped move that process along. The first bill,

21      sponsored by Senator Comrie and Assemblyman Kim

22      requires state agencies and public authorities to

23      require damages for delay clauses and contracts.

24      The second bill, sponsored by Senator Breslinn

2       and Assemblyman Mike Cusick defines substantial

3       completion on public work.

4                   Unfortunately, both those bills were

5       vetoed by the governor, however on the

6       substantial completion bill, the legislature did

7       re-pass an almost identical bill this year in

8       which AGC and our partners in the construction

9       world will be urging the governor to sign that

10      bill.

11                  It's really more, we think, more of an

12      educational process by looking through at the

13      veto jacket and adjusting some of the concerns

14      and comments from some of the groups that opined

15      on the bill. But we're hopeful that that bill

16      gets signed into law because each of these bills

17      has even greater importance during the COVID-19

18      pandemic as contractors, subcontractors and

19      material suppliers struggle with cash flow and

20      contractual difficulties imposed by state

21      agencies and authorities.

22                  Once again, thank you for the

23      opportunity to share our thoughts at this

24      important public hearing to discuss the COVID-19

2       impact on the MTA. AGC stands ready to continue

3       to fight for federal funding, to ease the fiscal

4       stress caused by the pandemic and we promise to

5       work safely to help get the MTA and public

6       transportation capitals back on track once again.

7       Thank you for the opportunity, and we appreciate

8       it.

9                   SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you very much,

10      Walter. It's always great to see you. Thank you

11      for your work and thank you for the leadership of

12      not only you, but all of AGC. You're always

13      there, of course, with Mike Elmendorf as well and

14      in our ears when it comes to infrastructure all

15      across the state. The MTA is no different than

16      that.

17                  Can you talk a little bit about how the

18      capital projects have been progressing during the

19      pandemic, especially given the reduced ridership,

20      the overnight shutdowns and the revenue

21      shortfalls?

22                  MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Well, yeah, I think

23      earlier testimony by the MTA, I think it was by

24      Janno Lieber, really kind of summed it up pretty



                                Geneva Worldwide, Inc.

2       well for us. A lot of the construction projects

3       are currently on pause awaiting those federal

4       infrastructure dollars. Like I said, we've spoken

5       to 15 different congress people. We have had them

6       on for 30 minutes at a time, which is really

7       extraordinary, when you think about the hectic

8       schedules that the congressional representatives

9       have.

10                  And they know our points, and they know

11      the points of the governor, the points of both

12      the state legislature, that with construction

13      projects on pause and the MTA just using the

14      current federal cash that they have, you know,

15      we're very worried about this year, we're even

16      more so worried about next year, and without that

17      next tranche of federal dollars coming in,

18      everything is going to be on hold and we're going

19      to be just in -- we're not going to be

20      progressing forward, we're just going to be

21      trying to save what we have right now.

22                  SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you. And does

23      the association have any recommendations for

24      potential cost savings during this crisis?

2                  MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Yeah, well we focused

3       in on the federal side of things. I mean one of

4       the things that the industry always talks about

5       is reforming New York's scaffold law. The MTA has

6       clear data on their liability costs, on what

7       scaffold law costs them specifically. It's a

8       tough decision for the legislature and the

9       governor, but, you know, if all options are on

10      the table, then why not scaffold law right now?

11      It's, you know, in essence an equal protection

12      under the law scenario where a contractor should

13      have their day in court, as should the MTA in

14      that situation, as the owner, and scaffold law

15      reform is always something that would be

16      important to look at in terms of cost savings.

17                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Well, thank you for

18      your testimony. Again, thank you for your

19      leadership and all of your efforts. We look

20      forward to our continued work together.

21                 MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Great job, senator.

22      Thank you.

23                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Thank you.

2       you. Just a couple of questions, I'm just

3       curious, are construction costs going up or down

4       as a result of, you know, risks because of the

5       pandemic, for example, might cause them to go up.

6       Workers might demand more money, but the scarcity

7       of work might mean workers are willing to take

8       less or construction companies, so I just

9       wondered what your take is.

10                 MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Yeah, I mean, as it

11      relates to this conversation, we're talking about

12      prevailing wages here, so those wages are to be

13      bargained, so the wages side doesn't really

14      impact us all that directly. However, the costs

15      of PPE, the costs of just slowing down your day,

16      so, for example, you can't pack workers into an

17      elevator and bring them up to the 60th floor to

18      build a building. You can't pack workers in the

19      tight confined spaces because of social

20      distancing requirements.

21                 So those are some of the areas where

22      initially that we've heard the most concerns

23      about costs being a driver. But, look, at the end

24      of the day, construction is agile. The companies

2       are agile. The workers are agile. And you make

3       things work. And we make things work to deliver

4       projects on time and on budget.

5                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Are there some

6       projects that are more risky in terms of safety

7       issues because of the closeness, you have to work

8       together to be safe while you're doing a project?

9       Are there some things that have to be on hold,

10      underground projects, over ground, you know, you

11      mentioned going up in an elevator. How did the

12      individual projects, or are any individual

13      projects going to be impacted because of those

14      issues?

15                 MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Well, each project is

16      really on a chafes by case basis, and from a

17      safety assessment point of view, we have two

18      trained safety professionals that provide a lot

19      of guidance to the membership of AGC in terms of

20      training, education, best practices, and, you

21      know, we make that work. Interior contractors

22      have a little more difficult time. You work in

23      the tunnel at the MTA, it's a little more

24      difficult, some of the confined spaces. Hospitals

2       are a little tougher to work on because of

3       different entrances and different points of

4       egress. Those are some of the examples that we

5       have dealt with early on during the pandemic, but

6       like I said, we're an agile industry and we work

7       to get the job done.

8                  ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you very

9       much. I turn it over to the senator.

10                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you also for your

11      testimony and for your consistent advocacy with

12      AGC and to Mike and his team also, thank you for

13      everything you're doing, and we look forward to

14      working with you as we try to figure out how to

15      continue to revive this state.

16                 Are you able to and are your contractors

17      able to give the MTA suggestions about

18      efficiencies and alternate ways of doing the

19      projects to create faster turnaround? Is that a

20      good dialogue that you're having?

21                 MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Very much so, senator.

22      We consider the MTA under the leadership of Pat

23      Foye and Janno Lieber and some of the other team

24      work there, we're talking about big projects here

2       that require that continuous dialogue, the back-

3       and-forth that's required to get the job done on

4       time. A lot of times these are complicated jobs,

5       you're working in a very old system, as far as

6       the MTA goes specifically, and we find them very,

7       very receptive and we're grateful.

8                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Thank you. I was

9       thinking like they mentioned the issues with

10      third track and merging old tech with new tech

11      and old construction with new construction, so

12      your GCs are able to have those discussions with

13      them and not get caught up in six month delays is

14      they have to -- once they get in the ground they

15      see something that's totally different than

16      what's scoped. You're getting that kind of good

17      feedback from them?

18                 MR. PACHOLCZAK:              Generally speaking,

19      senator, yes. I haven't heard to the contrary

20      there, as far as working with the MTA, you know,

21      they're good people to work with, and it's an

22      important job to help resuscitate our economy.

23      Things are tough all over here in the state, in

24      the city, and in the nation, and we're there.

2       We're there when you need us and we're always

3       there when you need us. And then moving forward,

4       based on our record of safety, we'll be there in

5       the future should we get a second wave as well.

6                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Got you. Thank you.

7       With that, we have no questions from any other

8       members. Do you have any on your side, assembly

9       member?

10                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    I don't.

11                 SENATOR COMRIE:              I'm going to take the

12      opportunity to wrap up and thank you all for

13      testifying. I want to thank everyone for

14      testifying today. I want to thank my team that

15      helped make this happen so that I halfway acted

16      like I knew what I was talking about, and that's

17      my chief of staff Derrick Davis, Andrew Taranto

18      Chris LaBarge, the great Chris Higgins, the great

19      David Frazier, the great [unintelligible]

20      [05:25:07] Bahadi [phonetic], Allison Bradley,

21      who's always great and Daniel Ranalon [phonetic]

22      who is always great from our administrative

23      speaker's office, who helped out today.

24                 And I want to thank again my colleagues

2       for asking questions and giving me questions and

3       to all of the people that testified today, thank

4       you for participating. This is going to be a

5       process where we all need to collaborate together

6       to try to make sure that we resuscitate the

7       system so that we can help bring back our city.

8                  I also want to thank my great co-chairs,

9       my brother from Buffalo Tim Kennedy and my sister

10      from -- where are you? Westchester, Amy Paulin

11      for being the great chairs that you are. Amy

12      Paulin just did a 13 and-a-half hour hearing two

13      days I think. It felt like two days ago.

14                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    It felt like

15      yesterday.

16                 SENATOR COMRIE:              Yeah, it felt like

17      yesterday. So she's truly a champion at this. So

18      thank you for everything that you're doing to

19      make sure that we have these hearings. And as

20      you've heard, we need to keep the pressure on.

21      And I look forward to working with both of you to

22      make that happen. Thank you all.

23                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Thank you.

24                 SENATOR KENNEDY:               Chairman Comrie, thank

2       you for your leadership. Chairwoman Paulin, thank

3       you for your leadership. And I echo the

4       sentiments of Chairman Comrie in just thanking

5       all the staff for your extraordinary efforts in

6       once again making this a flawless public hearing.

7                  And let me just mention once again that

8       this Democratic Senate, along with our colleagues

9       in the Assembly, have done more public hearings

10      to make sure that we are being as transparent as

11      possible than ever before. So I would argue that

12      there's probably a historic number of these

13      public hearings, and I am hopeful that it's with

14      great effect and that we can come up with some

15      very strong solutions moving forward. It's a

16      pleasure and honor to work with you and look

17      forward to our continued work together. Thank you

18      again. Chairwoman.

19                 ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAULIN:                    Yes. I'll just

20      add my thanks to the assembly side of things. To

21      the staff, central staff, Dallas, Kristen and

22      Corey, and my personal staff, Stephanie who

23      worked diligently to help me get prepared. I

24      really want to acknowledge also Ashley and

2       Stanley who helped put this together, and without

3       their help and time clock abilities, we would not

4       be where we are. So thank you all.

5                   Thank you again for everyone who

6       testified. You really help us understand the

7       issues so much better and help us and guide us to

8       making the right decisions. So thank you all.

9       Thank you to my co-chairs on the senate side.

10      It's been an honor and a pleasure.

11                  SENATOR COMRIE:              Stay safe.
