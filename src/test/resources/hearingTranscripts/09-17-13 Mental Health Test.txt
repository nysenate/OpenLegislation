       1             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Good morning.

       2             I'm Senator David Carlucci, Chairman of the

       3      Mental Health Committee in the New York State

       4      Senate.

       5             I would like to welcome everyone here today.

       6             We're here today, as everyone knows, for the

       7      Regional Centers of Excellence, to hear the concerns

       8      of the community, for people that are working at the

       9      center, working in the community, families that have

      10      been living with consumers, and just to hear the

      11      concerns, to make sure that everything is taken into

      12      consideration, to make sure that we continue to

      13      provide the best level of care to people living in

      14      North Country.

      15             Yesterday, I had the opportunity, along with

      16      Senator Patty Ritchie, to tour the facility.  I was

      17      with Imogene Raeger [ph.], who is on the board of

      18      visitors, so we got to see the facility, and meet

      19      some of the staff.

      20             And, I thank you for allowing me to do that.

      21             With that, I would like to turn it over to my

      22      counterpart in the Assembly, Chairwoman of the

      23      Assembly Mental Health and Developmental

      24      Disabilities Committee.

      25             Assemblywoman.
