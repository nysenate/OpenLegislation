       1             SENATOR SAVINO:  So, good morning, everyone.

       2             I'm State Senator Diane Savino, and I am the

       3      main sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act of the

       4      New York State Senate.

       5             I am joined here by my colleague in the

       6      Senate Majority Coalition and the Independent

       7      Democratic Conference, Senator David Carlucci from

       8      Rockland County.

       9             We will be joined, on and off, during our

      19      of applause for that.

      20                  [Applause.]

      21             SENATOR SAVINO:  A year ago, people said that

      22      this bill was dead on arrival in the Senate.

      23             We knew better, and, we worked very

      24      aggressively to begin to change people's minds.

      25             And what we're doing today is trying to
