       2      Mike Kimelberg, Seneca Nation Chief Operating

       3      Officer, and I welcome you to this historic event.

       4             The New York State Senate and Seneca Nation

       5      leadership understand that the drug issue knows no

       6      boundaries.

       7             And we welcome the State's Task Force to our

       8      territory today, to work together on this matter of

       9      mutual concern.

      10             Today's joint forum reinforces the need to

      11      tackle this community issue with cooperation,

      12      collaboration, and commitment of all resources at

      13      our disposal.

      14             As is customary, we'll be starting today's

      15      event with a traditional prayer.

      16             I would like to introduce Seneca Nation

      17      member Travis Stafford for today's [speaking native

      18      language], which is -- kind of serves as a daily

      19      reminder to appreciate and acknowledge all things.

      20             Travis.

      21             Oh, for media purposes, we don't videotape or

      22      audiotape this portion.  Thanks.

      23                  [Proceeding taken off video and audio.]

      24                  [The forum resumed, as follows:]

      25             MICHAEL KIMELBERG:  Thank you, Travis, for
