       1             SENATOR VALESKY:  I want to welcome everyone

       2      to -- this is called "a meeting of public interest."

       3      It's intended to be more of a roundtable discussion

       4      than what a public hearing would be.  And I thought

       5      that might serve our purposes better for the topic

       6      that we're discussing.

       7             For those of you who don't know, my name is

       8      Senator David Valesky.  I'm the chair of the

       9      Senate Aging Committee.

      10             And, I have an interest in gathering all of

      11      you together, and many of you have actually reached

      12      out to me in my office, to have a discussion about

      13      the SAGE Commission's work, and the work that

      14      they're doing right now, and what may or may not be

      15      included as part of their report as it relates to

      16      the state Office for the Aging.

      17             Just before we start, the reason for the

      18      microphones, we in the senate have -- as, hopefully,

      19      many of you know, are placing a high priority on

      20      transparency and openness in government.  So, this

      21      meeting is being webcast.  And that's why the

      22      technology, here.

      23             And, in fact, anyone who has any comments,

      24      who might be watching this, we certainly ask you to

      25      submit them to my office.







                                                                   5
       1             So, again, this intended -- we may have other

       2      members of the Aging Committee join us.  There are a

       3      number of things going on here in the Capitol this

       4      morning.  So, hopefully, we'll have some of my

       5      colleagues join us as well.

       6             I thought what we could do:  We have about an

       7      hour, give or take, and this is intended, again, to

       8      be a rather informal conversation.

       9             My goal in conducting this roundtable

      10      discussion, is to listen to all of you, to take your

      11      comments, to take your suggestions.  And my intent

      12      is to catalog the comments that I receive here

      13      today, and get them to the SAGE Commission, and

      14      Paul Francis, who is heading up that effort, just as

      15      soon as possible.

      16             The intent is, therefore, that all of you

      17      will have a voice in the commission's deliberations,

      18      which may be taking a while.  I think that, you

      19      know, from a process perspective, I think it may be

      20      taking a little longer than they had originally

      21      anticipated; but, that's fine with us.  It gives us

      22      more time to make our case.

      23             So, I think with that, I would just like to

      24      go around the room, and have everyone, at this

      25      point, introduce themselves; tell us where you are







                                                                   6
       1      from, and then we'll open up the conversation.

       2             So, if we could, we'll start on my left.

       3             MS. MILLER:  Hi.  I'm Nancy Miller.  I'm the

      10             MR. BACHELOR:  Brendon Bachelor (ph.) from

      20             SENATOR VALESKY:  Very good.

      21             Thank you all for being here.

      22             I'm going to ask -- even though he doesn't

      23      know this -- I'm going to actually ask Mike Burgess,

      24      who, as all of you know, is a former director of the

      25      state Office for the Aging, actually, speak first,







                                                                   9
       1      and offer us his thoughts, from his perspective.

       2             And then, again, really, the intent is to

       3      have a give-and-take.  I would like everybody to

       4      have an opportunity to, certainly, weigh-in.  But,

       5      certainly, feel free to have a back-and-forth,

       6      because that's the intent of doing this in this

       7      format.

       8             So, Mike, if you wouldn't mind kicking us

       9      off, that would be great.

      10             MR. BURGESS:  Thank you for having this

      11      meeting, Senator, because we requested that you do

      12      this, and appreciate it.

      13             I would just say, to start, that, you know,

      14      the state Office for the Aging, the history of it,

      15      50 years, actually, this year, Governor Rockefeller

      16      started it before there was an Older Americans Act,

      17      and before there were state Offices for the Aging.

      18             But, anyway, you know, for 45 years, there

      19      has been a state Office for the Aging in New York

      20      State.  And it has been, the original charge of it,

      21      was to be an agency to, advocate, and serve older

      22      people, across the board, on a wide variety of

      23      issues and concerns.

      24             And, then, you know, here in New York State,

      25      we have an elder law that was put into place also.







                                                                   10
       1             And I think, in the context of the discussion

       2      today, I would like to keep pointing out, that the

       3      mission has always been very broad.  In fact, the

       4      idea was, at the time, when older people were not

       5      being fully represented in state government, and had

       6      a lot of very serious problems, which many of us

       7      have helped to address over the years, that older

       8      people needed an advocate in all of state

       9      government.  Not just providing services, but that

      10      there would be an agency that would sort of do an

      11      aging-impact statement about everything going on in

      12      government, whether it be in, health or housing,

      13      discrimination, or whatever.

      14             So, that's been the nature of the agency.

      15             And, then, the network of county agencies,

      16      over the years, of course, has been fully developed,

      17      along with all of the program and services in

      18      different areas that are represented at the table

      19      here today.

      20             And I think that many of us feel that, as we

      21      go forward, looking at, certainly, the fact that

      22      there can be some efficiencies, and some

      23      administrative changes, that will be saving some

      24      money, and maybe make services more coordinated, we

      25      don't want to lose the things that have made this







                                                                   11
       1      network so unique and special.  And that older

       2      people look upon this as their gateway into state

       3      government.

       4             It's really kind of a constitu- -- one of the

       5      few agencies that really, as opposed to being

       6      regulatory, or just a bureaucracy, is the

       7      constituent service agency, that provides some

       8      direct services, like the ombuds program, is

       9      actually run by the state Office for the Aging.  The

      10      only program that the state actually runs.

      11             And, then, having a senior citizens' help

      12      line, having a governor's advisory council, I think

      13      that all of these issues, as we have heard some of

      14      the debate about the SAGE Commission, are these

      15      kinds of things, this kind of entry, this kind of

      16      outreach to the public, is this going to be

      17      maintained?

      18             Or, you know, if there are other

      19      alternatives, let's separate out some of the

      20      functions that we've seen, and make sure that, that

      21      just for the sake of efficiencies, that we don't

      22      lose the advocacy part of it.

      23             So, that would be kind of my overview of

      24      this, but everybody else has a lot more they can

      25      give.







                                                                   12
       1             SENATOR VALESKY:  Who would like to --

       2             MS. MESICK:  Laura, do you want to speak

       3      first, and then I will?

       4             MS. CAMERON:  Sure.

       5             MS. MESICK:  Okay.

       6             MS. CAMERON:  Well, Senator, thank you again

       7      for convening this meeting.  It's very important, as

       8      we're looking at the future of aging.

       9             In preparation for this meeting, the group

      10      that is seated today has been working together in an

      11      informal coalition.  We've been having a lot of

      12      conference calls and in-person meetings.

      13             And our goal was, really, after we saw the

      14      SAGE Commission's goal of efficiency in government,

      15      et cetera, and there were a few recommendations

      16      that, you know, have bubbled to the surface from,

      17      apparently, their steering committees, and, we, as

      18      various groups representing senior programming, got

      19      together and said:

      20             Let's collectively put our minds together,

      21      and what can we dream that the state Office for

      22      Aging could be?  And, what would the possibilities

      23      be?

      24             And, how could we best serve the seniors of

      25      this state? -- which, pretty soon, will be us,







                                                                   13
       1      sitting in the room.  I think we're all realizing,

       2      that's kind around the corner for us as well.

       3             So, how can we put our minds together, and

       4      make a recommendation to the SAGE Commission, and to

       5      you, as chair of the Aging Committee?

       6             And, what would it look like?  What would we

       7      call it?

       8             All of those kinds of questions we've been

       9      talking about.

      10             So, we do -- we do -- we did put together,

      11      actually, a written proposal.  And we'd be happy to

      12      share it with you.

      13             To be honest, we finalized it in the late

      14      hours last night, so --

      15             [Laughter.]

      16             MS. CAMERON:  -- sort of "hot off the press,"

      17      if you will.

      18             But, what we would like to do is, I'll

      19      introduce the concept.  And, then, there are some

      20      others that will really talk about the underpinnings

      21      and the guiding principles that got us to the

      22      proposal we're going to give to you today.

      23             SENATOR VALESKY:  Great.

      24             MS. CAMERON:  Essentially, what we have

      25      proposed, is something that we call "The Office for







                                                                   14
       1      Aging and Community Supports," with added

       2      responsibilities; because, we believe that NYSOFA

       3      has always been the picture of efficiency, and has

       4      delivered services exceptionally well.

       5             Mike Burgess is a previous NYSOFA director;

       6      has highlighted a lot of the really good things that

       7      NYSOFA has done.

       8             What we envision is, an enhanced-and-improved

       9      NYSOFA; because, you know, as our state has fiscal

      10      issues, we believe that NYSOFA is well positioned to

      11      provide the cost-effective services to keep seniors

      12      in their homes, which is where they want to be.

      13             And, they only can do that, however, if they

      14      do have additional resources and additional programs

      15      that helps seniors.

      16             You're well aware of all of the demographics

      17      of seniors.  And we really believe that this would

      18      position the state office very well, for the future,

      19      and for our seniors.

      20             And as we examine this, what really led us to

      21      this, was a long list of guiding principles, that

      22      Edie will talk about, which will help you to

      23      understand how we came to that conclusion.

      24             MS. MESICK:  Right.

      25             So, we wanted to approach the question,







                                                                   15
       1      because we both understood that there was a

       2      proposal, perhaps, that the SAGE Commission was

       3      considering.

       4             But, we also understood that the real

       5      question is:  What is best for the aging of the

       6      population in New York State?

       7             And, also:  What is best, from a public

       8      policy perspective?

       9             And, so, we looked at, really:  What are our

      10      guiding principles?

      11             What do we think are the issues that need to

      12      be considered in any configuration of service

      13      delivery in New York State?

      14             And, so, we started to understand, to make

      15      clear to ourselves -- and we thank you again,

      16      Senator, for this opportunity to make it clear

      17      through your efforts as well -- that the aging

      18      process is multi-faceted.  That it is not -- most

      19      seniors, as they age, do not need medical services.

      20      What they need is social supports.

      21             And, as Mike said, as Laura said, it's so

      22      important that this ---therefore, that the state's

      23      Office for Aging services be, really, an independent

      24      office; an office that reports directly to the

      25      Governor, so that it really reflects the voice of







                                                                   16
       1      the people.

       2             We looked at the fact that, obviously, aging

       3      in place, in homes, and with community-based

       4      services, is the least expensive, and the most

       5      appropriate, way of delivering services.

       6             So, that has to be a part of whatever this

       7      new entity looks like.

       8             We recognize that the ombudsman program is a

       9      very successful program.  And, it needs to be

      10      protected from conflict of interest with an agency

      11      that otherwise regulates services.

      12             So, we put that down as one of our guiding

      13      principles.

      14             We also recognized that there is an important

      15      opportunity in this question for many other services

      16      that are provided in different agencies in

      17      New York State.

      18             And, therefore, our recommendation is, that

      19      we have, truly, a strengthened Office for the Aging,

      20      and an Office for Aging and Community Supports, that

      21      takes in some other of the services.

      22             So, those are our guiding principles.  That's

      23      how we came to this recommendation.

      24             And I'm sure there are others who want to

      25      jump in, from their particular perspectives.







                                                                   17
       1             MS. COOK:  Senator, AnnMarie Cook again, from

       2      Rochester.

       3             We also talked about strengthening, really,

       4      the Office for Aging, for two reasons, as others

       5      have said:

       6             One:  We recognize the difficult financial

       7      times that there are.  There is no question about

       8      that, and that services have to be delivered in a

       9      cost-effective manner.

      10             Second thing:  With this proposal, that we're

      11      saying, preserves the desire of older adults to

      12      remain independent.

      13             And I think the philosophy of NYSOFA has

      14      always been to support and empower older adults;

      15      and, therefore, has always led to that

      16      cost-effective way.

      17             We're also suggesting, in addition to

      18      state Office for Aging programs, because they are

      19      disbursed throughout the state, I'm just going to

      20      name a few:

      21             First of all:  The Kinship Care Program

      22      currently resides in the Office of Children and

      23      Family Services, in which, of course, is

      24      Grandparents Raising Grandchildren.

      25             And those individuals can benefit greatly, I







                                                                   18
       1      think, from other support services that Office for

       2      Aging could bring, and melding that into the office.

       3             Second one:  HEAP, the heating assistance

       4      program for older adults over the age of 60,

       5      currently, an OTDA, and, as we all know here, that

       6      provide direct services.  There are so many older

       7      adults who need that assistance.  And, need many

       8      other programs, that they need HEAP services.

       9             Third one we'd like to talk about is:

      10      False Prevention Program.

      11             Currently, in the department of health, falls

      12      are the leading cause of accidental death in older

      13      adults.

      14             Also, is a great way, very cost-effective

      15      way, in which we can provide evidence-based services

      16      to older adults, to prevent falls, in our senior

      17      centers, and other areas where older adults gather.

      18             And, then, the residential emergency

      19      services, home repair, to the elderly; once, again,

      20      helping them remain independent in their own

      21      community.

      22             There are other services in other areas of

      23      state government.  We have highlighted these, but we

      24      would like to bring these services that help older

      25      adults under the umbrella of the Office for Aging







                                                                   19
       1      and Community Support Services.

       2             MS. ALVAREZ:  Maria Alvarez, from New York

       3      Statewide Senior Action Council.

       4             The other thing is, that we also recognize

       5      that the population of New York State is

       6      increasingly aging, so the infrastructure has to be

       7      adapted to what the population realistically is

       8      becoming in New York State.  And, so, all of these

       9      services would be more efficient.

      10             In order to provide them a more efficient

      11      service to the -- this population, it would be

      12      better to do, you know, to consider it, this

      13      proposal.

      14             The other thing is, that, all of these -- all

      15      of these programs represent economic stability for

      16      seniors.  People who are living on fixed incomes

      17      need these supports in order to stay in the

      18      community.

      19             We have -- through our study, we have found

      20      that, on the average, in New York State, it takes

      21      about $26,000 for a healthy senior to live in the

      22      community, independently.  You know, that's without

      23      any type of home care or home attendants or

      24      long-term care in the community.

      25             We also know that only a quarter of the







                                                                   20
       1      seniors live socially on social security, which is

       2      about, you know, $14,000, this year.

       3             So, in order to bridge that gap, we need

       4      these services in order to keep seniors in the

       5      community, which are becoming the largest part of

       6      the population.

       7             MS. MILLER:  Nancy Miller, from VISIONS.

       8             I wanted to add to what Maria was saying, but

       9      from a slightly different perspective.

      10             People think of NYSOFA as an umbrella, but I

      11      think of it as an upside-down funnel.

      12             NYSOFA has a brand.  It is well known.  It is

      13      where people focus when they have a question, of all

      14      economic backgrounds.

      15             And, although NYSOFA has been a strong voice

      16      for people of low income and limited income, what

      17      they have been able to do is, mobilize people of all

      18      economic backgrounds to build the supports that

      19      older people need.

      20             They may be well-off today, but 30 years from

      21      now, when they outlive their savings, they may not

      22      be so well-off.

      23             So, think of NYSOFA as the funnel.

      24             It's like a laser.  Everybody knows where

      25      that point is.







                                                                   21
       1             That entry point is NYSOFA.

       2             And, then, the funnel opens to all of the

       3      other services and supports that exist, both, in the

       4      Aging Network, but also in the other agencies around

       5      New York State.

       6             The role that NYSOFA has played, as an

       7      advocate, to amplify the voice of older people, is,

       8      actually, to work collaboratively with other state

       9      agencies.

      10             So, for example:  The New York State

      11      Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped,

      12      which is housed in the Office of Children and

      13      Family Services, for the 200,000 older severely

      14      visually impaired and blind people, CBVH, the

      15      commission, works collaboratively with NYSOFA so

      16      that they can get the information out to the

      17      population that is most in need.

      18             I understand the purposes behind SAGE.  And

      19      there are some state agencies that, if they were to

      20      disappear, nobody would notice.

      21             NYSOFA is not one of them.

      22             NYSOFA is so well known, and is such a focal

      23      point, that its loss would be like creating a black

      24      hole.

      25             I think it also represents the extreme







                                                                   22
       1      diversity of New York State.  And some of the recent

       2      census analysis, is that, as New York State ages,

       3      it's not just the 60-and-over population, but we

       4      have fewer younger people.  And the average age

       5      upstate now, has gone up several years; which sounds

       6      like not much, going from, maybe, 30 to 33, average.

       7      But, when you look at what makes that happen, it's

       8      that dramatic increase of the 85-plus population.

       9             It's people who are the most frail, the most

      10      vulnerable, that's where you find most severe vision

      11      loss and blindness.  You're talking about other

      12      disabilities that people have to manage with.

      13             But, if you talk to older blind people, and

      14      if you ask them, "Are you sick?" they say:

      15      Absolutely not.  With rehabilitation, with support

      16      services, with transportation, with respite, I'm not

      17      sick.  I just need access.  And with that access, I

      18      can be as independent as any person, with or without

      19      sight.

      20             That's what NYSOFA is able to do; is to take

      21      that resource, that is the strength of New York, and

      22      provide it to individuals, so that, not only can

      23      they age in place, but they can age in place as

      24      healthy as possible, which is less stress on all of

      25      the other resources of New York State.







                                                                   23
       1             So, it's nursing-home diversion, it's

       2      Medicaid delay.

       3             We're not going to say that our services

       4      prevent people from needing long-term care.  But, if

       5      we can delay it six months, eight months,

       6      nine months, that's billions of dollars of savings

       7      for New York State.

       8             So, why fix something that isn't broken?

       9             NYSOFA works.

      10             And it works as a collaborator, and it works

      11      as a focal point.  Everybody knows it's there, uses

      12      it.  And, NYSOFA has been agile enough to really

      13      meet the needs of seniors who ask for it, and need

      14      very different things.

      15             SENATOR VALESKY:  Uh-huh.

      16             I want to follow up on one of the points that

      17      you made.  But, before I do that, I want to

      18      introduce Marty Golden, who, as all of you know, is

      19      former chair of the Aging Committee, and a

      20      tremendous advocate for seniors around the state.

      21             We just began about, 10, 15 minutes ago.

      22             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Thank you, Senator.

      23             SENATOR VALESKY:  And the participants here

      24      have, actually, done a lot of homework already,

      25      before this meeting.







                                                                   24
       1             And, Laura began -- actually, Mike began.

       2             They have actually put a proposal together,

       3      that would actually strengthen the role of NYSOFA,

       4      as opposed to potential of diluting that role.

       5             SENATOR GOLDEN:  I happen to agree with them.

       6             SENATOR VALESKY:  I do too.

       7             [Laughter.]

       8             SENATOR VALESKY:  Very wise.

       9             Let me, just, to your point, you had said,

      10      many seniors, who view NYSOFA, and use NYSOFA, and

      11      your point about them not being sick.

      12             You know, we have all heard the potential of

      13      NYSOFA being, in some way, shape, or form, folded

      14      into, or swallowed up, by one of the largest

      15      agencies in the state.

      16             When you think of state bureaucracy, you

      17      know, you think of the department of health.

      18             Can -- I would just like, maybe, some folks

      19      to speak to that particular issue, and what that --

      20      the message that that could send to seniors in the

      21      state, if, in fact, that's what --

      22             MR. JELLINEK:  Igal Jellinek, Council of

      23      Senior Centers and Services.

      24             I think we're at a critical time in services;

      25      in aging and health services.







                                                                   25
       1             And I think we -- there's an opportunity here

       2      to really do some culture change.

       3             With the longevity revolution, people are

       4      living longer.  The issues out that there are no

       5      longer acute care.

       6             The system has to shift into chronic-based

       7      care.  And that's the home and community-based

       8      services that folks around this room provide.

       9             And that is also, less expensive.  It makes

      10      sense.  It gives us social supports in the

      11      community.

      12             One of the other points that we thought of,

      13      we came to the conclusion, is that, the state Office

      14      for the Aging needs, as representing all the seniors

      15      in New York State, not just the people who are on

      16      Medicaid, is, needs to have an identity of its own,

      17      and needs to report directly to the Governor, not to

      18      the health commissioner.

      19             I think it medicalizes the process.

      20             And I think, if we're going, and with the

      21      baby-boomers coming, I think it's critical that the

      22      state Office for the Aging be enhanced with the

      23      social supports.

      24             So, instead of things going over to health,

      25      is that, health -- some of the health programs that







                                                                   26
       1      have been stated here, and I'm sure there's many

       2      others, be brought over to SOFA, and really make it

       3      a robust state Office for the Aging, because that's

       4      where the needs are going to be, and that's where

       5      the services, that are in the community.

       6             Because, if you want to age in place today,

       7      you don't need high-tech supports.  You need your

       8      Meals-on-Wheels.  You need to have a case worker.

       9      You need to have -- when you're discharged from the

      10      hospital, you need to have a set of services that

      11      don't bring you back into the hospitals, which the

      12      hospitals are no longer going to get paid for,

      13      including falls prevention.

      14             So, all I'm saying is, there's an opportunity

      15      to really shift this whole system, and rebalance it.

      16             And I don't think this comes along a lot.

      17             It's really a critical time for us, right

      18      now.  And I think we all feel very strongly about

      19      this; that there needs to be, instead of the state

      20      Office for the Aging going over to health and

      21      becoming medicalized, it's sort of the reverse, and

      22      having an identity, and making it much more robust,

      23      and representative of the aging population in

      24      New York State.

      25             MS. DISARRO:  Ann DiSarro, from NYSCA.







                                                                   27
       1             I think there's also a culture difference --

       2             MS. MESICK:  Absolutely.

       3             MS. DISARRO:  -- between the community-based

       4      service providers and the health system.

       5             I sit on the board of Northeast Health, which

       6      is a local large health-provider organization.  And

       7      having worked in the aging field, I can now see both

       8      sides of that street.

       9             The health system is very regulated, and

      10      everything is very prescribed.  And there is no --

      11      or, little opportunity for responding to, kind of

      12      on-the-ground operational efficiencies and needs of

      13      the consumer.

      14             The aging system has been developed across

      15      the country, in a very different mode; looking to

      16      having local development of service provisions.

      17             One area agency is one area agency, across

      18      the state.  They are:  Take their money, and respond

      19      to the needs that are in the community, according to

      20      what other community supports are there, trying to

      21      maximize the resources among the community.

      22             It's a very cost-effective way of organizing

      23      service-delivery system.

      24             And that's why we think, if we look at

      25      companion services in the department of health, and







                                                                   28
       1      bring them to Aging, we actually think we can help

       2      save money.

       3             This is an opportunity to kind of take the

       4      Governor's challenge to all of us, to look at how we

       5      can be more efficient and effective, and kind of

       6      turn the idea on its head, and say:  We agree.  We

       7      think there's an opportunity to save money here.

       8             But, it's to look at this more,

       9      community-based.  Use the power and strength of the

      10      community.  And, also, of older people.

      11             We're very committed to using the

      12      independence and power and strength of older people,

      13      to advocate for themselves.  But, also, they can be

      14      a force of doing good things in the community, not

      15      just receiving services.

      16             Aging is not a health issue.  It's actually a

      17      resource that we can look at in the community.

      18             So, there's a very acute culture difference

      19      between the two organizations.  And we think that

      20      there is a danger that the strength and the

      21      cost-effectiveness that the Aging Network now

      22      provides, will get lost, if we made this move into

      23      health.

      24             SENATOR VALESKY:  Let me just come back to

      25      you.  I know that David wanted to jump in, and then







                                                                   29
       1      we'll come back with you.

       2             MR. McNALLY:  Well, thank you,

       3      Senator Golden, and Valesky, for this opportunity.

       4      We very much appreciate it.

       5             Well, this is upside-down conversation for

       6      sure.

       7             I think she referred to it as "a funnel," and

       8      said to think of everything in reverse.

       9             I mean, to take a well-run, fairly small

      10      agency, that has a very targeted purpose, and has a

      11      very clear mission, and to dump it into the abyss of

      12      what is now called "department of health," makes no

      13      sense, politically, economically, and even from a

      14      public-policy perspective.

      15             And I don't want to repeat all of the words

      16      that have been said here, but, you know, I'm --

      17             I am David McNally, with AARP, by the way.

      18             Hello.

      19             [Laughter.]

      20             MR. McNALLY:  You know, we have 2.4 million

      21      members.

      22             50-plus, and aging, is not about a disease.

      23             Aging is not an illness.  Aging is not a

      24      disease.

      25             And when we put it in the department of







                                                                   30
       1      health, that's immediately what it becomes, in

       2      everybody's mind.  Okay?

       3             So, rather than saying, maybe we've -- maybe

       4      the staffs for Aging should, somehow, be put into

       5      that abyss of DOH, DOH ought to be taking some

       6      lessons from what SOFA does.

       7             And I think the whole idea that this is just

       8      about the medical model is a terrible way for this

       9      state to go, again, both from a public-policy

      10      perspective and from cost perspective, as Ann and

      11      Michael and Igal have suggested.

      12             The -- this is an opportunity, for sure,

      13      though.

      14             Aging is not just health.  It's

      15      transportation and housing, and older workers, and

      16      discrimination.  And those issues are -- do not

      17      belong anywhere in a place called "the department of

      18      health."

      19             But, I do -- as Ann said, this as challenge

      20      by the Governor.  We should take that up and run

      21      with it.  That this is the time to create a robust,

      22      fully integrated opportunity for us to -- for all

      23      aging in New York.

      24             And aging is not just 65-plus.  We're all

      25      aging.  And it's an office that is called upon







                                                                   31
       1      frequently by those who are not, what we consider,

       2      older, but those who are grappling with trying to

       3      provide those services to the aging, of caregivers,

       4      of family members.

       5             So, it is an office critical to people of all

       6      ages.

       7             And I might say that, I think we learned, I

       8      think, a terrible snapshot of what the future might

       9      hold.  We kind of saw this most recent budget with

      10      New York Connects.

      11             We almost lost New York Connects because, the

      12      health department, or DOB, or somebody, said,

      13      "Oh, here, we need this one," without thinking about

      14      the long-term consequences as it relates to state

      15      and federal health-care reform.

      16             And we needed an ABRC.  And, here, we

      17      almost -- we've got one on the works here, and it

      18      was almost thrown out because we needed to save

      19      money.

      20             Again, I think that we're going to see more

      21      and more and more of that, if SOFA does not remain,

      22      and become even more, a powerful voice for the

      23      senior.

      24             And the last piece I want to add is what Ann

      25      alluded to about, about, this isn't just about --







                                                                   32
       1      this is a two-way street.

       2             This is:  How do we provide the supports, and

       3      services, so people can remain in their homes and

       4      their communities, which we know costs less money,

       5      which we know have better outcomes?

       6             But, it's also the other way around; how can

       7      all of us create opportunities to help to provide

       8      those services?

       9             We have a vast array of volunteer

      10      opportunities before us, if we could seize just a

      11      moment to create the communities, or "villages," as

      12      some are calling them.

      13             A volunteer; you know, we see what high-cap

      14      counselors can do.  But we also know, there's

      15      bill-paying programs, and delivering meals, and

      16      escorts to medical appointments, in the community.

      17      These are all, yes, sometimes they need to be paid

      18      for; but, many, many times, they can be developed

      19      into volunteer opportunities.

      20             Again, we're saving money.  We're providing a

      21      method to deliver them in the community, and the

      22      locality.

      23             And, even pet walking, frankly.  We all know

      24      the importance of pets in some of the older people's

      25      lives; in particular, when it comes to isolation.







                                                                   33
       1             That's another type of service.

       2             But, we should be seizing this moment, for

       3      sure.  And, not running from it, but running to the

       4      SAGE Commission and saying:  This is our moment.  We

       5      need to plan for the future, and for the burgeoning

       6      elderly population in the state.

       7             SENATOR VALESKY:  I couldn't agree more.

       8      That's a great point.

       9             Michael, before you do it, I just wanted to

      10      ask a question, and correct me if I'm wrong.

      11             But, this notion of an aging -- an

      12      "Office for the Aging" director, reporting to

      13      someone other than the governor, and, therefore, not

      14      a cabinet-level position; does not the federal

      15      Older Americans Act require, for receipt of certain

      16      federal dollars, require cabinet-level position

      17      for -- and I'm looking to you, Michael?

      18             No?

      19             MR. BURGESS:  There has to be a director.

      20      But, you know, a lot of these states have a

      21      health -- have, like in Washington, health and human

      22      services, and then there's an Aging division within

      23      that.

      24             But, a lot of them are independent.

      25             In our elder law, which was enacted, it says







                                                                   34
       1      that there has to be a director, I believe,

       2      reporting to the governor.

       3             And I think the point here is, that, if there

       4      were a proposal to change that, you would be

       5      changing the elder law.  And we'd like to know if

       6      that was the intent, if that's what the

       7      SAGE Commission comes up with.

       8             But I think that's a good point, because the

       9      director should have the governor's ear, and should

      10      be confirmed by the senate.  Otherwise, it's just a

      11      division within another department.

      12             SENATOR VALESKY:  Mike?

      13             MR. ROMANO:  Mike Romano, from Oneida County.

      14             And I just thought it was important to speak

      15      to the fact that there are a number of counties in

      16      New York State who have effectively blended

      17      Older American Act programs with Medicaid long-term

      18      care community-based programs.  And it has proven to

      19      be cost-effective and consumer-oriented.

      20             For example:  Those counties, at the

      21      programs, can, you know, seamlessly transition

      22      consumers from non-medical programs into more

      23      skilled-type community-based services, fairly

      24      seamlessly.  And it has proven to be a good model of

      25      Aging services.







                                                                   35
       1             The key to that, though, is that, the

       2      Aging Network really needs to be the focal point for

       3      those types of programs and services.

       4             The Aging Network, especially in the last few

       5      years, has really taken some federal dollars and

       6      federal programs, and created consumer-directed care

       7      under the Older Americans Act.

       8             So, it's proven to be able to administer, you

       9      know, flexible consumer-directed services.

      10             I feel that any model that the Aging Network

      11      is not the lead of, you know, would be a detriment

      12      to the aging population, and their consumers.

      13             And just one final point, is that, just

      14      within the last two years, other networks, such as

      15      the Veterans Administration, has looked upon the

      16      Aging Network as a leader for community-based care,

      17      and has established partnerships with several

      18      counties here in New York State, to provide services

      19      for veterans; long-term care services for veterans.

      20             SENATOR VALESKY:  Richard?

      21             MR. HALDEMAN:  Yes, Senator, thank you for

      22      inviting us here today.

      23             My name is Richard Haldeman.  I represent the

      24      Ombudsman Alliance.

      25             By the way, the "Haldeman" name has no







                                                                   36
       1      reference to any past political parties down in

       2      Washington.

       3             [Laughter.]

       4             MR. HALDEMAN:  As the ombudsman program is

       5      listed, we came here to Albany, February 8th, to

       6      make our legislators aware of the ombudsman program.

       7             Many people in this state, when you mention

       8      "ombudsman," they look at you, like, funny, "What is

       9      that?"

      10             We're the largest volunteer organization in

      11      the state of New York.

      12             We are under the Department of Aging.  We're

      13      funded by Title 7, the Older Americans Act.  So, we

      14      have the money from the money stream that does come

      15      from Washington, and it's disseminated through the

      16      Office of Aging.

      17             Last year, our volunteers provided over

      18      206,000 volunteer hours, to nursing homes, assisted

      19      livings, family-type homes, adult homes.

      20             If the department of health had to take over

      21      that, that equates to about $5.8 million that the

      22      state would have had to spend to send people from

      23      DOH out, to do the same job that our volunteers do.

      24             So, we're probably one of the few programs

      25      that don't normally come in and ask for money.  Our







                                                                   37
       1      funding does come from Washington.

       2             And some of our concerns would be:

       3             If we were to go under a department of

       4      health-type environment, how would that money stream

       5      be disseminated?

       6             Would it be, continually with, the Aging, you

       7      know, budgeting program?  Where would it go?

       8             Also, another concern that we have is, our

       9      program is very unique, in that, as we certify our

      10      volunteers -- which we are doing around the state

      11      now, again -- we are exempt from all HIPAA laws when

      12      we advocate for residents in nursing homes, assisted

      13      living.

      14             Our advocacy is that of, you know, a

      15      doctor-patient, lawyer-client.

      16             We also spend a lot of time in these

      17      facilities that, normally, a person in a working

      18      environment would not be able to do.  Our volunteers

      19      are in nursing homes, two, three, four hours a week,

      20      trying to maintain, and indicate, that the care is

      21      being provided, that's supposed to be provided, in

      22      those facilities.

      23             So, we advocate for that.

      24             Protections under the Older Americans Act,

      25      are unique to us alone.  And our concern, that if







                                                                   38
       1      Aging did move into another entity of DOH, DOH is

       2      part of what we work with.  But, also, when we find

       3      problems in facilities, we have to move that,

       4      sometimes, up the ladder, to DOH, and -- to look

       5      into it.

       6             And if they decide that it's not something

       7      that they feel is a complaint in a nursing home,

       8      they could kind of overrule, or cause a conflict, if

       9      you will.

      10             So, conflict is another issue that, you know,

      11      we really can't be a part of, being the unique

      12      program that we are.

      13             In our autonomy, is what I was talking

      14      before, DOH being a licensing agency, also, could

      15      overrule some of the concerns that we would have in

      16      our advocacy.  It would put us in a very difficult

      17      position.

      18             And, perception, more than anything else, if

      19      we were to tie into an entity, such as DOH, the

      20      people that we advocate for, and the staff and

      21      people that we become involved with in facilities,

      22      know that DOH comes in and does surveys every 12 to

      23      15 months.

      24             They come in, looking for critical issues

      25      that, you know, they want to cite you for one thing







                                                                   39
       1      or another.

       2             By being autonomous, we, many times, hear

       3      from staff, administrators, about issues that are

       4      very high concern, through the department of health.

       5             So, when you get down to where the rubber

       6      meets the road, our autonomy, and

       7      conflict-of-interest issue, is extremely important,

       8      to ensure that this program is viable, and

       9      continues.

      10             And I heard around the table, saying, that

      11      the population is aging.

      12             Well, it is.  We're all aging.  And I'm doing

      13      it pretty fast myself.

      14             [Laughter.]

      15             But, when you look down the road, with the

      16      baby-boomers coming through the doors, nursing homes

      17      are going to be expanding.  I hate to say that, but

      18      it's going to happen, even though you're going to do

      19      a lot of care in home, you know, in-home care.

      20             So, you know, the ombudsman program is very

      21      vital.  They're probably the most vulnerable part of

      22      our society.

      23             We don't want to see that interrupted, and be

      24      in conflict with, or have another interest, that,

      25      you know, may be detrimental to what we do.







                                                                   40
       1             And I got to tell you:  We're teaching an

       2      ombudsman certification course right now, up in

       3      Saratoga.  We have 24 people.

       4             People come from all walks of life to become

       5      volunteers in this program.  And they are the

       6      most -- I just can't -- their advocacy is just

       7      something that they bring to the table, they bring

       8      it to these people, in nursing homes, and assisted

       9      livings.  You know, it's almost like it's their

      10      family.  People create that relationship.

      11             We would not want to lose that; that ability

      12      to do that.

      13             And we, also, and I think, the gal that

      14      mentioned before, I think that the SOFA, director,

      15      or whatever may be the outcome of this, should have

      16      the ear of the governor's office.

      17             And I don't really have anything else.

      18             MS. MESICK:  Senator, one other comment from

      19      one of the other meetings that we had:  We heard

      20      from a North Country local Office for the Aging,

      21      that talked about their blend, also, of the medical,

      22      with social supports, again, directed by the local

      23      Office for the Aging.

      24             And they talked about difficulty in getting

      25      answers and direction from the health side for some







                                                                   41
       1      of the work, from the state Department of Health.

       2             And only recognizing, kind of the size of the

       3      bureaucracy, and the way in which questions, by

       4      culture, need to be answered; as opposed to the way

       5      that the Office for the Aging -- the state Office

       6      for Aging is able to provide support.

       7             So, again, it's an example to your question

       8      of:  What are some of the issues we see, if we were

       9      to make the move in that direction, as opposed to

      10      really strengthening the state Office for the Aging.

      11             MS. AULDRIDGE:  If I could build off the

      12      point you're saying, I also think --

      13             My name is Allison Auldridge, from

      14      Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders.

      15             -- and I wanted to raise the issue of the

      16      population of older adults who are in the greatest

      17      social and economic need, which is something the OAA

      18      spells out as a mandate for state units on aging,

      19      which is -- which are groups that, I think, that

      20      most of us are concerned about, kind of losing a

      21      focus if NYSOFA were to be absorbed into DOH.

      22             These include:  People of color.  GLBT

      23      elders.  Older adults with HIV, disabilities.

      24             A number of these groups experience extreme

      25      health disparities.  They have lower rates of







                                                                   42
       1      health-insurance coverage, higher rates of diseases.

       2      They experience more stress than other counterparts

       3      of their age.

       4             So, I think that that's another concern that

       5      we also outline in our principles, as a concern for

       6      what happens when the DOH is overseeing all of

       7      these.

       8             MS. MILLER:  I think, also --

       9             Nancy Miller, from VISIONS.

      10             -- that my experience with the department of

      11      health -- and we are not funded in any way by DOH,

      12      so I don't speak as a contractor -- it's a very

      13      rigid system by -- by its funding streams.

      14             NYSOFA is, soft, and cushy, and it molds to

      15      the need.

      16             And I think that --

      17             SENATOR VALESKY:  Is that your legacy, Mike?

      18             MR. BURGESS:  I hope not.

      19             [Laughter.]

      20             MS. MILLER:  But the point is, that -- and I

      21      think it's been mentioned by most of the speakers,

      22      that there's a creativity and flexibility that is

      23      allowed by an agency that has to look at, new ways,

      24      pilots, demonstrations, new ways of communicating.

      25             I think the strength of NYSOFA is actually in







                                                                   43
       1      this room, if you see the diversity of the various

       2      Aging cohorts that are being represented, that's

       3      natural for NYSOFA.  We all sit together, and figure

       4      out how to blend what is there.

       5             That's not the culture of DOH.  And it's much

       6      harder to get to the level of a decision-maker;

       7      whereas, the director of the state Office for the

       8      Aging has always been extremely accessible.  You

       9      pick up a phone, and you can actually get to that

      10      person.

      11             And that's what state government should be.

      12             Why is state government in business?  It's

      13      for the people.

      14             NYSOFA is state government, that is

      15      accessible to the people; the little people, as well

      16      as the advocates.

      17             And that's something you would lose through

      18      the culture of DOH.

      19             SENATOR VALESKY:  Well said.

      20             MR. BURGESS:  I just want to make one point

      21      about what Rich said, because I want to illustrate,

      22      there was a real conflict of interest that we faced

      23      last year.

      24             The ombuds program was appointed by the

      25      bankruptcy court to represent the patients -- or,







                                                                   44
       1      the residents of four nursing homes, Northwoods,

       2      that was go through a bankruptcy proceeding.  And

       3      that court put the ombuds program -- the judge said,

       4      "I will decide this case on the best interests of

       5      the patient" -- "of the residents."

       6             And what the ombuds director says -- and the

       7      local ombuds' director, not the state office --

       8      "Will be what I determine."

       9             That situation was not exactly -- I mean, the

      10      health department did go in and inspect these

      11      facilities, and try to make sure that they were not

      12      short-staffing during this bankruptcy proceeding.

      13             But if the ombuds program had said, they

      14      are being mistreated, and whatever, and those

      15      facilities had closed, that wasn't necessarily a

      16      gift to the health department, because they would

      17      have had to look at finding a place for all of them.

      18             So, that's an example of where there was a

      19      direct difference between what the ombuds program

      20      would be doing, and I'm not saying the

      21      health department didn't care, but it would have had

      22      a different role, and a different purpose.

      23             And I wanted you to be aware of that because

      24      there are other responsibilities that the ombuds

      25      program has.  And recognizing -- the bankruptcy







                                                                   45
       1      court recognizing them is something totally outside

       2      of state government.

       3             SENATOR VALESKY:  Deb?

       4             MS. RITANO:  Hi.  Deb Ritano, from

       5      Jewish Family Services, the neighborhood NORC

       6      program; and, so, I have the opportunity to really

       7      give direct service.

       8             And what I wanted to say, something that

       9      Nancy had said, when she was describing the

      10      "cushy" NYSOFA, was, for us to be able to pick up

      11      that phone and speak to them directly is very

      12      important, because they are the agency that combines

      13      their head and their heart when they're dealing with

      14      an individual.  And you can call, with an

      15      individual, through the NORC program.

      16             And for us it would be disastrous, if, in

      17      fact, as you said, we were swallowed up by the

      18      department of health.

      19             Our seniors are -- we do not have a medical

      20      model.  We have social model.

      21             We do, now, have a part-time nurse who can

      22      follow up, so that we can prevent re-admission to

      23      the hospital.

      24             We have a handy man that the seniors can

      25      call, to come and change that light bulb, or to be







                                                                   46
       1      able to clean out those gutters so that they won't

       2      fall.

       3             We're able to do those kinds of things.

       4             But, the bigger part of it is, is that, on

       5      that grant, we're a bigger -- has -- is a bigger

       6      partnership, with all of these senior services and

       7      Catholic clarities, and all of the other people

       8      around the community, who are able to support that

       9      NORC initiative, to be able to respond to the needs

      10      of the seniors in the community.

      11             MS. KRAKOWSKI:  Molly Krakowski at JSA.

      12             Actually, I wanted to go back to what Nancy

      13      said, and what we talked about, in terms of that

      14      point of entry, because I think that that speaks a

      15      lot to the difference between the two directions

      16      that are sort of in front of us.

      17             A lot of energy went into bringing us all to

      18      the table, creating these points of entry, looking

      19      at how we can all work together, being community

      20      partners with the state Office for the Aging.

      21             We were reached out to when it came do the

      22      Medicare Part D enrollment, education.  A lot of us

      23      had been involved with the advocacy when it came to

      24      you know, Part D, for example.  But, then, we were

      25      the same go-to people when it came to trying to







                                                                   47
       1      educate people, and help them to figure out how to

       2      navigate the system.

       3             I think that it's, both, tangible, and it's

       4      also the perception of, if you fold in aging into

       5      this vast DOH, or other, you know, medical model, it

       6      loses that exact piece and component which all of

       7      us, I think, are connected to, which is, that we are

       8      a partner with this state.

       9             We are very effective at getting out the

      10      information, communicating with people, and saving a

      11      lot of money in the process by funneling people to

      12      the right direction -- you know, getting people to

      13      the right service, in the right way, and so that

      14      they're not inundating a health-care model or a

      15      health system.

      16             And I think, also -- and I'm not a dollars'

      17      person -- but, I think it's clear, that once an

      18      Aging department would be folded into a health

      19      model, we're no longer really on the -- we're no

      20      longer a point of interest in terms of looking at a

      21      budget.

      22             I think it then becomes this enormous budget

      23      that we always look at.  And, how can we cut the

      24      budget?  And, how can we slice-and-dice these huge

      25      departments?







                                                                   48
       1             And, Aging is just inside there, somewhere,

       2      but it's no longer on the radar as a distinct budget

       3      cut, or as something very clear, and how it's going

       4      to affect all of us in the community.

       5             So, you know, we are a lot of big and small

       6      agencies out in the community.  And we do represent

       7      very different but conjoined -- you know, conjoining

       8      organizations.

       9             And, that network, I think, would be

      10      completely decimated once folded into a different

      11      model.

      12             I think that things we do now with VISIONS,

      13      for example, or other groups which are now under

      14      state Office for the Aging, would then fall under

      15      some other category within health.

      16             It wouldn't necessarily be that same flow

      17      that we currently have, and where we are able to

      18      pull together and say:

      19             Okay, what do we all need?

      20             And, how can we word this so that it's

      21      inclusive?

      22             Or, that, you know, we're really recognizing

      23      where the state is coming from, but also not losing

      24      where we all are.

      25             And the other thing is, this idea of block







                                                                   49
       1      grants being the answer, when a lot of us have been

       2      doing services in the community, and have a lot of

       3      experience doing really good work in the community.

       4      And trying to sort of not lose sight of what's a lot

       5      of work has gone into over the years, in developing

       6      that other model.

       7             MS. TINNEY:  Carin Tinney from

       8      United Neighborhood Houses.

       9             I just wanted to build on a lot of what's

      10      been said here, and to speak a little bit about what

      11      happens when you medicalize a service.

      12             When you think about somebody who has, say,

      13      dementia, and they go in to a doctor; and, what does

      14      the doctor do?

      15             They prescribe, like, an anti-anxiety

      16      medication and anti-psychotic, Aricept.  They treat

      17      the symptoms.  Right?

      18             The programs offered by SOFA will look at the

      19      whole person, and look at the whole family and the

      20      whole support system, and help that person and that

      21      family get along in society, that's the community,

      22      which is often the sick part.  Right?

      23             They'll look at, you know, if somebody is in

      24      the third stage of dementia, or they're speaking in

      25      tongues, and they don't know, you know, what







                                                                   50
       1      their -- their spouse doesn't know what they're

       2      saying anymore, they'll help their spouse, as well

       3      as the person who has dementia.

       4             So, SOFA programs often look at the broader

       5      picture.  They're not just looking at blood-pressure

       6      outcome.  They're looking at the whole person, the

       7      whole community, the whole support network.

       8             So, that's -- you know, that's one of the

       9      downsides of a medical model, is that, you're losing

      10      sight of the whole self -- to which SOFA does,

      11      amazingly so, with NORC programs, with

      12      SAD programs (social adult day), with

      13      case-management programs, caregiver-support

      14      programs -- you know, in addition to the financial

      15      cost of medicalizing something, that that is there,

      16      and that's very much a reality.

      17             I also just wanted to, you know, point out,

      18      like, something that I've often thought of, is that,

      19      we've never really prepared our own communities and

      20      our neighborhoods to deal with an older-adult

      21      population.  Because of longevity, we are living

      22      longer.

      23             So, things like -- you know, and AARP has

      24      done amazing work on this, and level of communities

      25      has done amazing work on this -- is that, you're







                                                                   51
       1      looking at things, that, we don't have the

       2      transportation systems to support somebody once they

       3      have not -- where they've stopped driving.  Right?

       4             You're looking -- you can go outside and

       5      probably find five broken sidewalks, you know.

       6             You can -- you know, just this -- the pure

       7      computerization of every service out there, you

       8      know.  And computers are like a third and fourth

       9      language to a lot of older adults, so it's a

      10      preventive factor from going out and doing the

      11      business that they used to do.

      12             And, you know, and on fixed incomes, and

      13      somebody mentioned before, you make something like,

      14      $1,400 a month.

      15             You know, the cost of a meal; you know, for

      16      somebody who cannot -- can no longer really pick up

      17      a pot because it's too heavy, and can't buy a pot

      18      because they're on a fixed income, you know, that's

      19      lighter, a cost of a meal is preventive to living

      20      wholly in the community.

      21             So, I often, really feel that our communities

      22      are the ones that are sick.  You know, not

      23      necessarily the people who are receiving services

      24      from SOFA.

      25             So, I think that the SOFA services that we







                                                                   52
       1      have are, often, fill the gaps to make the community

       2      whole, so that somebody can live very independently,

       3      and with dignity.

       4             And that's a huge word: with "dignity."

       5             The other point that I just wanted to make;

       6      you know, I've worked in nursing homes that are --

       7      you know, have not subscribed to culture change, and

       8      I've worked in nursing homes that have subscribed to

       9      culture change.

      10             And culture change is trying to undo that

      11      medical model.  Right?

      12             So, you know, an advocacy point for not

      13      putting SOFA in DOH, is that we don't want to do

      14      what they've done in the nursing homes; is, go to a

      15      place where the language is foreign, and, like,

      16      everything there is medicalized.  Right?  Because

      17      they're trying to get out of that now.

      18             Why would we want to go into that?

      19             So...

      20             And the last point is, that, you know, when

      21      this population was school-aged, they had to expand

      22      the schools.  Right?  Had to add more classrooms to

      23      on to deal with this.

      24             You know, when they started to get jobs, you

      25      know, the workforce was increased.  You know, and







                                                                   53
       1      the numbers of houses that were built, and

       2      apartments that were built, were increased.

       3             Now this population, that we're facing right

       4      now, is coming into communities.  We need to expand

       5      the services within the communities, to help to

       6      support them, to live.

       7             So, with that...

       8             MR. McNALLY:  I want to build off that a

       9      little bit.

      10             We're not ready, and the future is not, as

      11      far as the size of the aging population that Nancy

      12      mentioned.

      13             If you go to Miami-Dade County, or if you

      14      have ever been to Senior Day at the State Fair,

      15      that's what our population is going to look like

      16      very, very soon.  And we're not prepared at all.

      17             And we couldn't -- even if everyone wanted to

      18      go into a nursing home, and could afford to -- which

      19      are two ridiculous "ifs" -- we couldn't build

      20      enough.

      21             [Laughter.]

      22             MR. McNALLY:  We couldn't build enough.

      23             So, we really need to be focusing on these

      24      pieces of the non-medical.  And, SOFA is the only

      25      place to do it.  Or, something like SOFA, or a







                                                                   54
       1      more-empowered SOFA.

       2             But I don't want to miss the opportunity to

       3      raise the issue of efficiencies as well.

       4             And I'm not -- I don't know anything about

       5      SOFA's internal bureaucracy.  Maybe Mike can speak

       6      to that a little more, or some of the providers that

       7      deal with them.

       8             But, if there are, HR issues, web-design

       9      issues, contracts; all that kind of stuff that goes

      10      on in a bureaucracy, if that, somehow, can help save

      11      money, that's great, by doing it with other parts of

      12      the government.

      13             But more important, from my -- our

      14      perspective, is --

      15             And I'm David McNally, with AARP.

      16              -- is:  Does that free the agency up even

      17      more, to actually focus on their mission, and

      18      delivery of services and programs?

      19             MR. NADEAU:  Christopher Nadeau, with

      20      NYSADSA.

      21             I think most big states are moving in the

      22      direction of -- of, they're realizing that they've

      23      over-medicalized their long-term-care system.  And,

      24      so, they're sort of moving in the other direction,

      25      looking how you can blend in services.







                                                                   55
       1             And I think that's a lot of what we're

       2      talking about here.

       3             And the division is, that NYSOFA could be a

       4      tremendous gateway to coordinated care.  And I think

       5      that's the direction that we need to go.

       6             And, I think to be on the right side of

       7      history here, in terms of home and innovative

       8      services, that's what families want.  And we know

       9      it's cheaper.

      10             So, I think that there's a tremendous amount

      11      of synergy here, to move in that direction.  I just

      12      hope that we have the will to do it.

      13             SENATOR VALESKY:  Just one second.

      14             Yes, Senator Golden?

      15             SENATOR GOLDEN:  I want to jump in.  I have a

      16      load of committee meetings this morning.

      17             I think it's important.  I want to thank

      18      Senator Valesky, the chairman, for putting this

      19      together, and bringing all of the advocates together

      20      in a room, to discuss this issue.

      21             There are several things, obviously, and it's

      22      been said:  From the design of --, they can absorb

      23      some of the -- HR, some of the other areas that

      24      might be duplicated.  Maybe they can do it better,

      25      in health, in certain instances.







                                                                   56
       1             The problem that I've seen with aging over

       2      the years, at SOFA, I've seen the, I think,

       3      neighborhood NORCs?  Tremendous.

       4             Open NORCs?  Tremendous.

       5             Ombudsman; we worked to make sure that we got

       6      that done.

       7             Mike, we worked with you as the advocate, and

       8      as the director.

       9             And we've always had one problem, and that

      10      was getting enough money for the director.

      11             We always seem to be able to fight for,

      12      keeping senior centers open in New York City,

      13      getting transportation for Upstate New York, trying

      14      to get these open NORCs to include areas -- vast

      15      areas of upstate and downstate.

      16             And, coming up with, you know, the tens of

      17      millions of hours that are donated by the

      18      caregivers, coordinating that, and making sure we're

      19      keeping our aging population out of nursing homes,

      20      and out of the assisted-living facilities, and out

      21      hospitals; as a last resort, after we have exhausted

      22      all of our volunteers, and all of our volunteers --

      23      and we've trained those volunteers, and they can't

      24      do it anymore, and it's the only step left, is to go

      25      into the medical -- into an assisted-living







                                                                   57
       1      facility, which saves this state, and this nation,

       2      tremendous, tremendous money, with what this SOFA

       3      has done, in the past, and can do in the future.

       4             There are two areas that we have to -- I

       5      think, to be able to expand on, and that's, you

       6      know, recommendation that you brought here today.

       7      And, getting our message to the Governor.

       8             And I applaud the Governor for trying to do

       9      the work that he's trying to do here in this state.

      10             I think that, the new Medicaid design, I

      11      think is going to have some issues.

      12             God willing, we'll be able to work through

      13      them over the course of next six or eight months.

      14             But, I already see a low number of areas,

      15      where it's already impacted, and they need help.

      16      And that's before we get to the 2014

      17      President Obama's health care for our nation.

      18             So, when you finish with the state and the

      19      nation, what is left here for the consumer, the

      20      client, us?

      21             What are we to have, as we grow older; what

      22      are we to expect?

      23             And we cannot allow our dignity, and we

      24      cannot allow our quality of life, to be changed to

      25      such a degree that it would impact on our health,







                                                                   58
       1      impact on our families, and impact on our

       2      volunteers.

       3             So, the second part of this is:  How do we

       4      get our message to the Governor, and have the

       5      Governor understand the importance of, maintaining a

       6      SOFA agency, funding more money into SOFA, and

       7      allowing them to continue to do, and to enhance the

       8      mission, that they have been, and should be, given?

       9             I think we all agree here, department of

      10      health, I love them, but it's a black hole.

      11             And, the commissioner is going to do a great

      12      job in trying to coordinate and organize, and do

      13      what his responsibility will be.  But, his

      14      responsibilities in the department of health are too

      15      many.

      16             There are too many tentacles in the

      17      department of health; and, therefore, only one

      18      reason to move SOFA into the department of health,

      19      is for savings, so that means we're covered.  Right?

      20             So, the programs we see here today, that we

      21      talked about, are going to be cut.  So, we can't

      22      allow some of those programs -- many of those

      23      programs, we have to enhance those programs, bring

      24      new programs in, do best practices across this

      25      nation, and around the world, to bring the best







                                                                   59
       1      possible outcome to the seniors here in our

       2      communities.

       3             So, that's the two, I think, missions that I

       4      think Senator Valesky, the chairman, is focusing on;

       5      and that's:  The recommendation expansion.  And,

       6      getting our message, and the understanding, that

       7      this is something that this state must have.

       8             So, that challenge is to you:

       9             How do we get this governor, this good

      10      governor, to understand the necessity of SOFA?

      11             How does that message get delivered to your

      12      client base?

      13             How does that get delivered to our governor?

      14             And, how do we manage this, and create and

      15      expand on the recommendations, that the good

      16      governor would want to put his name to, and

      17      participate in?

      18             I think that's the focus.

      19             And I might have left a couple of things out,

      20      but that's what -- I have had the privilege of

      21      working with a good director, and a couple of good

      22      directors here.  And Mike did a good job.

      23             Thank you.

      24             MR. McNALLY:  Could you tell us a little bit

      25      about what your perspec- -- what is going to happen?







                                                                   60
       1             I mean to say, we keep hearing different

       2      rumors of:

       3             Whether they've met.

       4             Or, are they meeting?

       5             Or, are they going to make this May 30th

       6      deadline?

       7             Is it an up-or-down vote this year?

       8             Do they have several years to do this?

       9             What is the legislature's --

      10             SENATOR VALESKY:  We're the same --

      11             MR. McNALLY:  Okay.

      12             SENATOR VALESKY:  We're in same boat as you;

      13      we're hearing the rumors that no official

      14      communication, certainly, with me and/or with you.

      15             I don't think -- whatever happens, I think

      16      the process is, will take a much longer period of

      17      time than they may have originally indicated.  I

      18      don't think we're going to be doing anything,

      19      legislatively before the end of this legislative

      20      session, on any this stuff.

      21             And I think -- I think they're acknowledging

      22      that now.

      23             So -- but, you know, I think Senator Golden

      24      was right.  I think the -- one of the great

      25      challenges that we have -- and I want to commend







                                                                   61
       1      everyone for being proactive.

       2             I mean, you know, so often in government, we

       3      can sit back and wait for something to happen, and

       4      then we're forced into reactive mode.

       5             You know, from a budget perspective, I guess

       6      that's the way the process works.  But, we ought to

       7      see this, not as a threat, but as an opportunity.

       8             And I don't think we're up against a clock,

       9      necessarily, that has anything to do with this

      10      legislative session.

      11             So, you know, rolling out a communication

      12      strategy with the commission, and, as Senator Golden

      13      says, directly with the Governor, is, I think, all

      14      of our collective challenge.  And, I think this is

      15      the beginning of that process.

      16             SENATOR GOLDEN:  And if I may, I do believe

      17      that there are people within state government that

      18      believe this is a done deal.

      19             So, having said that; so, if people already

      20      believe it's a done deal, it's just a matter of time

      21      before the legislation is sent down:  Is the

      22      legislation going to be required, or is it just

      23      going to be absorbed?

      24             Because of the way the SOFA is listed in

      25      the -- on this state, I don't know if they need







                                                                   62
       1      legislation to move you over.

       2             MR. BURGESS:  This is the way --

       3             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Pardon me?

       4             MR. BURGESS:  This is the way that it's

       5      listed, as part of the executive --

       6             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Correct.

       7             MR. BURGESS:  -- department?

       8             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Correct.

       9             Do they need legislation to move you over?

      10             MR. BURGESS:  Well, the elder law, as I

      11      looked at it, I think they'd have to change it.

      12             You wrote it, actually --

      13             SENATOR GOLDEN:  I know.

      14             MR. BURGESS:  -- when you were there.  Right?

      15             [Laughter.]

      16             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Which they didn't want to

      17      take; which, they took three-quarters of it.  I wish

      18      they had taken all of it.  But, we did the

      19      neighborhood NORCs, we did the ombudsman; we did all

      20      of these programs over the last five years.

      21             MR. BURGESS:  That's right.

      22             SENATOR GOLDEN:  And I'm proud of each and

      23      every one of them.  And, of course, the elder law.

      24             MR. BURGESS:  Well, I think they would have

      25      to say that, you know, there's no longer a separate







                                                                   63
       1      agency, and no longer a director.

       2             That language had to be stricken from the

       3      elder law, and repealed.

       4             And -- so, I don't know that they could do it

       5      without you, the legislature.

       6             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Okay.  So, then, there would

       7      be -- I think we would have to do a little bit of

       8      homework on that.  And then that would be, we would

       9      increase, now, the goal of, not just talking with

      10      our governor, but also talking with the legislative

      11      bodies here, on the assembly and the senate side, to

      12      see the importance of delivering for the clients and

      13      base across the state of New York.

      14             And I think the legislature would understand

      15      that, and I think the Governor would understand,

      16      when, in numbers, and, in fact, what the savings can

      17      be, and how we can expand on those savings for the

      18      state of New York.

      19             I think that message has to be delivered.

      20      And I think the message has to go out, this can't be

      21      a done deal.  This has to be -- there are, all of

      22      the advocates -- and this is, again, just a small

      23      portion of the advocates across this great state --

      24      they have to be heard.  And we cannot allow it to go

      25      forward.







                                                                   64
       1             So, I agree with my good colleague,

       2      Senator Valesky, here.  I don't see it as one of the

       3      pressing issues.  There are a number of pressing

       4      issues coming down in the next four weeks.  But, I'm

       5      not so sure this can't just be absorbed.  So -- and

       6      come in for the legislative fixes in January or

       7      February.

       8             So, I think it's important, and imperative,

       9      and that we get our message out as soon as possible.

      10             MR. BURGESS:  Could I just add one thing;

      11      that, regardless of whether there is legislation,

      12      having been in that job over there, I think it would

      13      be unfair to the agency if the Governor did not --

      14      if there's no legislation this year, did not give

      15      clarity, and put a director in the agency, whether

      16      it's the acting director and make him official; but

      17      to keep the agency going as -- in limbo for another

      18      year, I think would be unfair to all of us, as well

      19      as to the staff there.

      20             So, I would urge you, that, if nothing else,

      21      that you urge the Governor to make a decision on the

      22      status of the director of that agency, so that we

      23      have something for the next year.

      24             SENATOR GOLDEN:  I think it's important that

      25      he makes an educated decision.  And that educated







                                                                   65
       1      decision is what you're putting together here today.

       2             MS. DISARRO:  To the pressure points that we

       3      have to make, would you tell us, I mean, is it, to

       4      the Governor? is it to the SAGE Commission?

       5             Where is --

       6             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Both.

       7             MS. CERENOS:  Okay.  We need to make sure

       8      that we take your charge, and do it to the right

       9      places here.

      10             SENATOR GOLDEN:  You have to show what some

      11      best practices around the nation.

      12             You pointed out Dade County.

      13             I was down in Hollandale and -- what's the

      14      county next-- Fort Lauderdale.  And I couldn't

      15      believe how that had changed.  I was there 40 years

      16      ago, with kids.

      17             I went down there, recently.  It was nothing

      18      but people, like me.

      19             [Laughter.]

      20             SENATOR GOLDEN:  The transformation, it was

      21      amazing.

      22             Then you went to Miami, and this whole part

      23      of Miami, there was thousands and thousand of young

      24      people.

      25             But, the majority of that part of Florida is







                                                                   66
       1      seniors.

       2             I think you have to expand on the

       3      recommendations.  You have to show savings.  And,

       4      you have to show what your mission -- what the

       5      mission of SOFA, can, and will be able to do, going

       6      forward.

       7             MS. DISARRO:  I understand.

       8             SENATOR GOLDEN:  And it comes down to the

       9      tens of millions of volunteers' hours that are going

      10      out there: the transportation, the Meals-on-Wheels.

      11             I dare to say, you know, I would ask the

      12      SAGE.

      13             And maybe I'm pushing this just a little bit

      14      too far, this envelope, but I don't want to do that,

      15      and I don't want to be dramatic on it, but, if any

      16      of the individuals that sit, and think that this is

      17      something that we should move, brought into health,

      18      they should go on -- in a van and deliver a meal

      19      at -- to a family, or to a woman, or a senior.  Go

      20      inside to some of the homes of our richest

      21      communities, our best communities, and you will see,

      22      and walk away from that in tears.

      23             So, there are people living substandard, our

      24      seniors.  And if it wasn't for the refrigerators,

      25      you would cry again.







                                                                   67
       1             So, I'm not trying to be dramatic here.  I'm

       2      trying to get a point across: there is a need.

       3             And I believe we cannot allow that need to be

       4      absorbed into what can be a bureaucracy that will

       5      slow down the process, and put more people into

       6      nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, and deny

       7      a quality of life for many of our seniors here in

       8      this great state.

       9             So, I think that has to be, without being

      10      with the drama, but I think that it has to be that

      11      dramatic; that they have to understand the

      12      necessities:

      13             The number of meals.

      14             The transportation Upstate New York, and how

      15      you have to be able to get around.

      16             The hospitals; how you keep people out of the

      17      hospitals, and out of nursing homes.

      18             And, real quickly, I have to close:  In

      19      Brooklyn, New York, where I represent, you actually

      20      wait 40 to 50 hours in the emergency room to get a

      21      bed.

      22             That's today.  That was before any of this

      23      went into effect.

      24             There are some points of the year, that you

      25      can wait over 100 hours for a bed in the hospitals







                                                                   68
       1      in my community.

       2             Now, if you know somebody, like a

       3      Senator Golden, you pick up the phone to get

       4      somebody a bed?  Well, great for that individual;

       5      but, what about the other 99 people that are

       6      sitting, waiting for a bed.

       7             Now, in self-injury; you get the bed.  Now

       8      you need rehab.  You've got to go to a nursing home.

       9             There's a line of a nursing home.  You cannot

      10      get into that rehab.  You have to actually wait, and

      11      make appointments for that.  That could be weeks

      12      before you get into a nursing home.

      13             I have no nursing beds in my community.  I

      14      don't know where all these nursing beds are.

      15             So, I think we have some serious crises going

      16      on.  I think Brooklyn is definitely going to be a

      17      "ground zero" for health-care issues in the future.

      18             But, there are a number of Brooklyns around

      19      the state of New York.  And we have to try to

      20      concentrate on that.

      21             Just think about that.

      22             There are lines, today.  And that's before

      23      the baby-boomers kick in.  That's before we see some

      24      real changes that will change that system to a way

      25      that we no longer know.  And we can't allow that to







                                                                   69
       1      happen.

       2             I have to run to my committee meetings.  I

       3      know I threw a lot out on the table there.

       4             But you have a very qualified and good

       5      chairman here.  He'll help.  And I will work with

       6      you, to coordinate, to get our message across.  And

       7      I think we have to get it across in a timely

       8      fashion, and it has to be a concise and decisive

       9      piece of literature, and information, that goes to

      10      the Governor, and to SAGE.

      11             Thank you.

      12             MS. MESICK:  Thank you.

      13             MR. JELLINEK:  Senator Golden, thank you for

      14      all the good work you have done on behalf of seniors

      15      in New York State.

      16             MS. MESICK:  Yes, thank you.

      17             SENATOR GOLDEN:  You're quite welcome.

      18             You keep up the good work that you're doing

      19      for seniors.

      20             Tell that "good little Bobbie," I said hello.

      21             [Laughter.]

      22             SENATOR GOLDEN:  Where are we hiding that

      23      woman today?

      24             MR. JELLINEK:  City hall.

      25             [Laughter.]

       1             SENATOR VALESKY:  Thank you, Senator.

       2             SENATOR GOLDEN:  You're quite welcome.

       3             Mr. Chair, thank you.

       4             SENATOR VALESKY:  Okay, who else?

       5             I want to make sure we have -- I don't know

       6      if we've heard from everyone?  Is there anyone who

       7      hasn't had a chance to weigh in?

       8             No?

       9             To wrap up, the last five minutes or so,

      10      anybody have any final thoughts that they want to

      11      share?

      12             MR. JELLINEK:  I think what's exciting about

      13      this, for us here, is that we're all embracing this

      14      opportunity.

      15             SENATOR VALESKY:  Uh-huh.

      16             MR. JELLINEK:  We're not being defensive.

      17      We're trying to take advantage of a seed change

      18      that's occurring.

      19             SENATOR VALESKY:  Yep.

      20             MR. JELLINEK:  And we believe it's the right

      21      thing to do.

      22             And I think, in the last three months, or

      23      longer, we have come together, to unite on this

      24      position.  And I think that could become a very

      25      powerful force.







                                                                   71
       1             And working with you, and all of groups

       2      around this room, and the groups that aren't in this

       3      room, I think we can force some of this change.

       4             The strategic work that needs to be done, we

       5      would love, all of us, to work closely with your

       6      office, and see how we can make this happen.

       7             And, with the Affordable Care health-care

       8      act, hospital is not getting a lot to-- getting

       9      reimbursed for discharge planning.

      10             Anybody who's discharged, and if someone is

      11      telling you, discharge planning is an oxymoron,

      12      there's no such thing.

      13             So, if they're not getting reimbursed for

      14      this, it's the community-based services, that are

      15      there, that need to be invested in.

      16             To me, it's a no-brainer.

      17             I mean, it's -- the services out there, that

      18      need to be invested in.  And there needs to be a

      19      flip, a rebalancing, of how to look at this.

      20             And from what I understand, hearing what the

      21      health commissioner said yesterday, he certainly

      22      gets this, in terms of product-based services.

      23             And the last piece is, you need a voice for

      24      aging in New York State that's independent, of

      25      somebody reporting to the health department.







                                                                   72
       1             SENATOR VALESKY:  Right.

       2             MR. JELLINEK:  So, I don't want to speak for

       3      everybody, but I'm just saying, I think we're pretty

       4      united on all of this.

       5             And I think the question is:  Do we get the

       6      seniors -- it's time to go back to the seniors, and

       7      start talking once, and putting some numbers to

       8      this.

       9             And if your staff can be helpful, in helping

      10      us to come up with some of the numbers -- I know

      11      some people have the expertise -- that would be

      12      really helpful.

      13             SENATOR VALESKY:  Absolutely.

      14             MS. MESICK:  I just also think, Senator,

      15      again, thanking you for your statement at the

      16      outset, which is, that you would like to communicate

      17      to the SAGE Commission, your own perspective.

      18             I think that's very powerful, and important.

      19      And we thank you for your willingness to do that.

      20             SENATOR VALESKY:  Well, that's my immediate

      21      next step after this.  And, again, communication is

      22      key.

      23             And I don't -- you know, the SAGE Commission

      24      is charged with lots and lots of, or will develop

      25      lots of, recommendations across the whole scope of a







                                                                   73
       1      $132 1/2 billion state budget that funds all our

       2      state agencies.

       3             But I think that, first, and foremost, all of

       4      you coming together, and being proactive -- and I

       5      don't have to repeat what I have already said --

       6      but, putting a proactive plan in place, as opposed

       7      to reacting to whatever they suggest, number one,

       8      critical.

       9             Now, it's that communication, from me, and

      10      from the perspective of the committee; from all of

      11      you, from the perspective of your leadership

      12      positions in your own communities.  And, then, as

      13      you just indicated, going back to your seniors, and

      14      others.

      15             Because, I don't know that -- you know, I

      16      haven't heard, in other areas, this kind of a united

      17      front, and communicating to the commission, and

      18      then, by extension, to the Governor.

      19             So, I think that's, clearly, the next step.

      20             I think the one thing that I would just, to

      21      follow up to Mike, on the issue of whether or not

      22      legislation would be needed?

      23             I think in addition to the elder law, you

      24      know, I mean, the budget is legislation.

      25             I can't imagine that there could be any







                                                                   74
       1      defunding of any state agency, without that being

       2      part of a legislative process.

       3             So, I can't -- you know, I could be wrong,

       4      but I can't imagine that there is any way that

       5      something like this could happen without the

       6      legislature's ultimate approval, so...

       7             And I don't see any chance of that happening

       8      in the next four weeks before this session ends,

       9      so...

      10             So, this is, again, the beginning of a

      11      process, and hopefully the end will be successful.

      12      And, you know, everyone, as I anticipated, raised

      13      incredibly salient points about why this is so

      14      important.

      15             So --

      16             MS. MESICK:  Thank you, Senator.

      17             (Roundtable participants say "Thank you.")

      18             SENATOR VALESKY:  Okay.

      19             All right, thank you all very much.

      20             (Roundtable participants say "Thank you.")

      25      roundtable session concluded.)
