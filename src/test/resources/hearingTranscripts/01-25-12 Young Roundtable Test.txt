       1             SENATOR YOUNG:  Thank you for taking the time

       2      for being here today.

       3             Joe, nice spiel this morning.

       4             But, as you also know, I became Chair of the

       5      Senate Housing Committee about a year ago, and since

       6      that time, we've been very busy with a lot of policy

       7      initiatives.

       8             But, I thought it would be helpful to get

       9      leaders in the industry together, to talk about

      10      different issues that face us, because, not only do

      11      I want to be reactive, and take care of concerns

      12      as they arise, but also be proactive and creative

      13      about how we're addressing housing needs, not just

      14      in New York City, but across the entire state.

      15             So, that's the whole thinking behind having

      16      these roundtables.  And, this is the third one

      17      that we've had.

      18             We had one about a month, month and a half

      19      ago, here, and talked to some of the academics,

      20      and people, kind of, in that mode.

      21             And then, this morning, we talked about

      22      people actually developing the housing, and now

      23      we've got our segment this afternoon.

      24             And we've talked about a lot of different

      25      issues that arise.
