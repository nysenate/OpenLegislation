2011A01653 T00352    3    S 51. Posting of notice regarding compensation. Every employer who has
2011A01653 T00353    4  complied with section fifty of this article shall post and maintain in a
2011A01653 T00354    5  conspicuous place or places in and about his place or places of business
2011A01653 T00355    6  typewritten or printed IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH notices in form prescribed

2011A01653 T00358    9  secured  the  payment  of compensation to his employees and their depen-
2011A01653 T00359   10  dents in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, but failure  to
2011A01653 T00360   11  post  such  notice  as  herein  provided shall not in any way affect the
2011A01653 T00361   12  exclusiveness of the remedy provided for by section eleven of this chap-
2011A01653 T00362   13  ter. Every employer who owns or operates automotive or horse-drawn vehi-

2011A01653 T00368   19  of said vehicles shall constitute presumptive evidence that such employ-
2011A01653 T00369   20  er  has  failed  to secure the payment of compensation. The chairman may
2011A01653 T00370   21  require any employer to furnish a written statement at any time  showing
2011A01653 T00371   22  the stock corporation, mutual corporation or reciprocal insurer in which
2011A01653 T00372   23  such  employer  is  insured  or  the  manner  in which such employer has
2011A01653 T00373   24  complied with any provision of this chapter. Failure for a period of ten
2011A01653 T00374   25  days to furnish such  written  statement  shall  constitute  presumptive
2011A01653 T00375   26  evidence that such employer has neglected or failed in respect of any of
2011A01653 T00376   27  the  matters  so  required.  Any  employer  who fails to comply with the
2011A01653 T00377   28  provisions of this section shall be required to pay to the board a  fine
2011A01653 T00378   29  of [up to two hundred fifty] FIVE HUNDRED dollars for each violation, in
