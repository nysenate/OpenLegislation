2011S00410 M00002
2011S00410 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S00410 M00004An act to amend the social services law, in relation to certain exempt
2011S00410 M00005assets for public assistance eligibility
2011S00410 M00006
2011S00410 M00007PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S00410 M00008To provide for a uniform allowable resource exemption for an applicant
2011S00410 M00009or recipient with an automobile.
2011S00410 M00010
2011S00410 M00011SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S00410 M00012Subdivision 1 of section 131-n of the social services law, as amended by
2011S00410 M00013chapter 373 of laws of 2003, to provide an automobile value increase to
2011S00410 M00014nine thousand three hundred dollars fair market value or a higher amount
2011S00410 M00015that a social services district may elect.
2011S00410 M00016
2011S00410 M00017JUSTIFICATION:
2011S00410 M00018The current law provides a two tier system for determining the automo-
2011S00410 M00019bile resource disregard when calculating the amount of benefits of any
2011S00410 M00020household under public assistance programs. The law provides a lower
2011S00410 M00021amount unless the automobile is being used to seek or retain employment.
2011S00410 M00022The current structure does not adequately contemplate the effects of
2011S00410 M00023inflation or other auto uses such as the pursuit of education. This
2011S00410 M00024legislation will provide a uniform automobile resource limit that is
2011S00410 M00025practical and fair to those individual who depend on their cars to
2011S00410 M00026facilitate their struggle out of poverty.

2011S01271AM00004An act to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to increasing
2011S01271AM00005the penalties for driving with a suspended or revoked license
2011S01271AM00006
2011S01271AM00007PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S01271AM00008To stiffen the penalties for driving with a suspended license in order
2011S01271AM00009to protect the safety of law abiding drivers.
2011S01271AM00010
2011S01271AM00011SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S01271AM00012This bill changes the penalties for driving with a suspended license.
2011S01271AM00013For a violation in the third degree, the penalty will be changed to a
2011S01271AM00014fine no less than $500 to no more than $1000 and/or no more than 30 days
2011S01271AM00015in jail. For a violation in the second degree, the penalty will change
2011S01271AM00016to a fine of no less than $1000 to no more than $5000 and/or up to 180
2011S01271AM00017days in jail. For a violation in the first degree, the penalty will be

2011S01271AM00020
2011S01271AM00021JUSTIFICATION:
2011S01271AM00022Irresponsible drivers in New York state whose licenses have been
2011S01271AM00023suspended or revoked are a danger to others when they operate a vehicle.
2011S01271AM00024However, time and time again accidents resulting in the injury and death
2011S01271AM00025of innocent people are caused by those who do not obey the law.Violators
2011S01271AM00026are not deterred by the consequences of driving without a license.
2011S01271AM00027There have been several accidents across the state in the past few years
2011S01271AM00028where dangerous drivers who have had their licenses suspended have
2011S01271AM00029gotten behind the wheel of a car and caused injuries and fatalities. The
2011S01271AM00030Legislature needs to send a clear and persuasive message by increasing
2011S01271AM00031the penalties for driving with a suspended license which will help deter
2011S01271AM00032those individuals. This legislation seeks to protect the public from
2011S01271AM00033those who not only drive irresponsibly, but are not supposed to be
2011S01271AM00034allowed on the road in the first place.

2011S03190BM00058
2011S03190BM00059JUSTIFICATION:
2011S03190BM00060Local districts face increasing challenges to fund necessary new school
2011S03190BM00061facilities. The state faces its own financial challenges which make it
2011S03190BM00062difficult to consider increasing assistance to local school districts to
2011S03190BM00063construct new facilities. It is necessary to seek innovative ways to
2011S03190BM00064reduce costs when new school buildings become necessary. Under this
2011S03190BM00065program, school districts would have the option to use the provisions of
2011S03190BM00066this act to construct school buildings at a lower cost and in a faster
2011S03190BM00067time frame than is permitted under current law by using the best current
2011S03190BM00068development, construction, reconstruction, leasing and financing tech-
2011S03190BM00069niques available. Similar legislation allowed the City of Niagara Falls
2011S03190BM00070to construct a new facility more affordably several years ago.

2011S04316AM00004An act to amend the criminal procedure law and the education law, in
2011S04316AM00005relation to expanding the geographical area of employment of university
2011S04316AM00006police officers; and to repeal paragraph (d) of subdivision 34-a of

2011S04316AM00008
2011S04316AM00009PURPOSE:
2011S04316AM00010To extend the jurisdiction, as it pertains to infractions and
2011S04316AM00011violations, of New York State University Police Officers from State
2011S04316AM00012University of New York property to all geographic areas within New York

2011S04316AM00014
2011S04316AM00015SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S04316AM00016Section 1. Amends paragraph (a) of Subdivision 34-a of Section 1.20 of
2011S04316AM00017the Criminal Procedure Law to provide that the geographical area of
2011S04316AM00018employment not only includes the campus but all geographic areas of New
2011S04316AM00019York State.
2011S04316AM00020Section 2. Amends paragraph (a) of subdivision 34-a of section 1.20 of

2011S04316AM00022Section 3. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 34--a of section 1.20 of the CPL
2011S04316AM00023is repealed.
2011S04316AM00024Section 4. Amends paragraph 1 of subdivision 2 of section 355 of the

2011S04316AM00026Section 5. Effective date.
2011S04316AM00027
2011S04316AM00028JUSTIFICATION:
2011S04316AM00029University Police is the only Agency Law Enforcement Services Unit,
2011S04316AM00030which includes the University Police, New York State Environmental
2011S04316AM00031Conservation Police, the New York State Forest Rangers and the New York
2011S04316AM00032State Park Police, that does not have the power to enforce infractions
2011S04316AM00033and violations outside of their geographic area of employment. This
2011S04316AM00034anomaly creates a situation that significantly undermines the officers'
2011S04316AM00035credibility, legitimacy and ability to perform their duties properly
2011S04316AM00036within the existing geographic area of employment.  In addition, the New
2011S04316AM00037York State University police are requesting this legislation to simply
2011S04316AM00038increase their geographic area of employment to all areas of New York
2011S04316AM00039State, as a measure to legitimize and augment their ability to lend
2011S04316AM00040supplemental support to neighboring law enforcement agencies and provide
2011S04316AM00041support statewide in the event of natural disasters such as Hurricane
2011S04316AM00042Irene or other emergency deployments.
2011S04316AM00043
2011S04316AM00044This legislation would also enable New York State University Police to
2011S04316AM00045provide immediate police action and protect' life and property in rare
2011S04316AM00046occasions where assistance is requested by citizens of surrounding
2011S04316AM00047areas.
2011S04316AM00048
2011S04316AM00049Finally, many New York universities and colleges are growing. The need
2011S04316AM00050for additional space to accommodate this growth has resulted in the
2011S04316AM00051acquisition of satellite properties not geographically connected to
2011S04316AM00052
2011S04316AM00053campus centers. Under current law, while traveling between these proper
2011S04316AM00054ties, NYS University Police Officers are statutorily limited and must
2011S04316AM00055ignore all violations and infractions occurring in their presence.

2011S05064aM00008The purpose of this legislation is to eliminate the assignment of bene-

2011S05064aM00010
2011S05064aM00011SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S05064aM00012Section 1 adds a new subsection (n) to section 5102 of the insurance law
2011S05064aM00013to define "health service provider"
2011S05064aM00014
2011S05064aM00015Section 2 adds a new section 5110 to the insurance law to prohibit the
2011S05064aM00016assignment of benefits for durable medical equipment to a health service
2011S05064aM00017provider unless the health service provider has been approved by the
2011S05064aM00018National Supplier Clearinghouse as an authorized Medicare supplier of
2011S05064aM00019durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies, Durable
2011S05064aM00020equipment includes, but is not limited to, durable medical equipment and
2011S05064aM00021supplies, medical/surgical supplies, orthopedic footwear and orthotic
2011S05064aM00022and prosthetic appliances.
2011S05064aM00023
2011S05064aM00024JUSTIFICATION:
2011S05064aM00025In recent years an increasing portion of the no-fault fraud has been
2011S05064aM00026observed in the area of durable medical equipment (DMF). In many
2011S05064aM00027instances the DME wholesaler is involved in the scam and the provider is
2011S05064aM00028committing fraud in conjunction with the medical supply companies. Many
2011S05064aM00029of these DME frauds occur in the following manner.
2011S05064aM00030
2011S05064aM00031Many items are subject to the fee schedule. Items not subject to the fee
2011S05064aM00032schedule are billed at a rate of 50% profit.  For example, TENS and EMS
2011S05064aM00033machines (which emit electrical impulses) perform nearly the same func-
2011S05064aM00034tions. Until last year TENS machines were not subject to the fee sched-
2011S05064aM00035ule, so TENS and EMS billing was relatively equal. However, last year
2011S05064aM00036TENS machines were put on the fee schedule It is no coincidence that
2011S05064aM00037no-fault fraudsters are reducing TENS billings and EMS billings have
2011S05064aM00038dramatically increased so that those fraudsters can fabricate a price
2011S05064aM00039and then add in the 50% profit on top.
2011S05064aM00040
2011S05064aM00041As is readily seen by these cases, this area of no-fault fraud is ramp-
2011S05064aM00042ant and growing at a tremendous rate producing the fastest and most cash
2011S05064aM00043profit of any fraud. Since January 1, 2009, there have been 739 new DME
2011S05064aM00044providers registered in NYS, There were 340 new facilities registered in
2011S05064aM00045Brooklyn alone but only 10 in Buffalo.  In one especially egregious
2011S05064aM00046case. one patient's DME billing included 16 different items totaling
2011S05064aM00047over $6,000 including a luxury turbo bath spa, an infrared heat wand, a
2011S05064aM00048wand massager, two different post-op knee braces. a back support seat, a
2011S05064aM00049TENS belt and others. The patient reports that they never used any of
2011S05064aM00050the items which were billed for.
2011S05064aM00051
2011S05064aM00052This legislation is not unique in prohibiting assignment of benefits for
2011S05064aM00053a lawful no-fault expense. Assignment of benefits for transportation
2011S05064aM00054expenses was originally allowed but the no-fault system quickly saw an
2011S05064aM00055explosive rise in those expenses. The Insurance Department amended the
2011S05064aM00056no-fault regulations to prohibit assignment of benefits for transporta-
2011S05064aM00057tion and the expenses fell very quickly.  Prohibiting assignment of
2011S05064aM00058benefits to health providers for DME should see the same outcome while
2011S05064aM00059still allowing the Do-fault claimant to directly receive payment for
2011S05064aM00060their legitimate DME needs.

2011S05491CM00041
2011S05491CM00042JUSTIFICATION:
2011S05491CM00043The NYC Regional Council designated the Staten Island Green Zone as one
2011S05491CM00044of eight priority projects for the City of New York in its January 2012
2011S05491CM00045report to the Governor. In addition, the Regional Council also desig-
2011S05491CM00046nated the West Shore of Staten Island, which is home to the proposed
2011S05491CM00047Green Zone. as an "Opportunity Zone" meaning special attention from
2011S05491CM00048Staten funding agencies should be given to this region, including fund-
2011S05491CM00049ing through the Excelsior Tax Credit program. The Federal Economic
2011S05491CM00050Development Administration recently awarded the Staten Island Economic
2011S05491CM00051Development Corporation $120,000 grant to study the proposed Green Zone.
2011S05491CM00052
2011S05491CM00053The Green Zone is a geographically designated area of Staten Island
2011S05491CM00054aimed at attracting companies that produce Green goods and services, or
2011S05491CM00055who utilize Green technology. The Green Zone attracts companies who work
2011S05491CM00056within the sphere of smart growth and environmentally friendly develop-
2011S05491CM00057ment and research. The Green Zone acts as a "go to place" for the entre-
2011S05491CM00058preneur who is prepared to put their technology into production and the
2011S05491CM00059market. Staten Island has a rich history of manufacturing and industrial
2011S05491CM00060production and a strong base for skilled labor. Advances in Green tech-
2011S05491CM00061nology allow for increased and diversified employment and production on
2011S05491CM00062Staten Island. Businesses that take measurable steps in increasing ener-
2011S05491CM00063gy and material efficiency will be the standard-bearers for increased
2011S05491CM00064Green initiatives throughout the region. The Green Zone and the initi-
2011S05491CM00065atives of Green Zone companies will educate local companies and resi-
2011S05491CM00066dents about the Green economy. This education and availability of
2011S05491CM00067resources will allow for efficiency retrofits, professional support and
2011S05491CM00068guidance for companies seeking financial incentives for Green invest-
2011S05491CM00069ment, promote Green Collar job retraining options, improve alternative
2011S05491CM00070energy development, and attract Green businesses that create sustainable
2011S05491CM00071employment opportunities for Islanders.
2011S05491CM00072
2011S05491CM00073A Green Enterprise Trade Zone is not unlike a Foreign Trade Zone. The
2011S05491CM00074concept of a Foreign Trade Zone has been part of our economic scheme
2011S05491CM00075since the 1930's. It exempted from tax, merchandise entering and leaving
2011S05491CM00076the Foreign Trade Zone, promotes trade and economic development.
2011S05491CM00077
2011S05491CM00078This legislation proposes to establish a Green enterprise Zone to
2011S05491CM00079encourage and develop the green technologies necessary to slow the
2011S05491CM00080outflow of our U.S. dollars to purchase foreign oil, to protect our
2011S05491CM00081environment by encouraging the adoption of green business strategies and
2011S05491CM00082the production of green technology thus creating an area where the
2011S05491CM00083investment community can focus on green product development, as well as
2011S05491CM00084an area where green products can be manufactured. This zone will estab-
2011S05491CM00085lish a location where companies focusing on green economic development
2011S05491CM00086can come together to individually and jointly spur development of a more
2011S05491CM00087green state.
2011S05491CM00088
2011S05491CM00089Most importantly. the Green Zone Act will provide a tax credit for the
2011S05491CM00090businesses that invest within it. providing an incentive to relocate
2011S05491CM00091within the zone and create the synergies of locating in a common area.

2011S05865AM00018Health to ensure the prompt removal of any raccoon from any outdoor
2011S05865AM00019public or private property upon receiving notice from a member of the
2011S05865AM00020public that a raccoon or raccoons have created a nuisance at such prop-
2011S05865AM00021erty.
2011S05865AM00022
2011S05865AM00023Section 2 provides for this act to take effect immediately.
2011S05865AM00024
2011S05865AM00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S05865AM00026
2011S05865AM00027Raccoons have become an increasing menace to residents of the city of
2011S05865AM00028New York and their numbers continue to rise. These animals are very
2011S05865AM00029industrious when it comes to foraging for food and create a health
2011S05865AM00030hazard as a result of breaking into locked as well as unlocked commer-
2011S05865AM00031cial and residential garbage bins and spread waste over wide areas in
2011S05865AM00032their paths. In addition, many of these animals are aggressive and have
2011S05865AM00033posed dangers to citizens and domesticated animals. This includes the
2011S05865AM00034spread of disease since these animals are common carriers of rabies,
2011S05865AM00035canine distemper and the very dangerous raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris
2011S05865AM00036procyonis).
2011S05865AM00037
2011S05865AM00038At present, the city provides no assistance to property owners who find
2011S05865AM00039raccoons on their properties, unless the animals are reported as rabid.
2011S05865AM00040311, as well as the Animal Care and Control, merely suggest that home-
2011S05865AM00041owners call licensed wildlife removal services or licensed private trap-
2011S05865AM00042pers which cost upwards of $250 and much more to remove a raccoon from a
2011S05865AM00043particular property.
2011S05865AM00044
2011S05865AM00045Given the clear health hazard and danger to public safety presented by
2011S05865AM00046these animals, the Department of Health should be required to provide
2011S05865AM00047assistance to property owners who ask to have such animals removed.

2011S06084AM00030JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06084AM00031The Michigan Street African American Heritage Corridor Commission was
2011S06084AM00032designated as part of New York's system of heritage area in 2007. The
2011S06084AM00033Commission encompasses the geographical east side of downtown Buffalo,
2011S06084AM00034in Erie County. It encompasses the J. Edward Nash House, Michigan Street
2011S06084AM00035Baptist Church, the Langston Hughes Institute, and the Colored Musicians
2011S06084AM00036Club, associated with and revealing of a historic role as the center of
2011S06084AM00037African-American history, culture and reform activities. The importance
2011S06084AM00038of the Commission's mission to develop the heritage corridor to function
2011S06084AM00039as a destination for both academic research and tourism is imperative.
2011S06084AM00040To further the Commission's purpose, it must have a dedicated funding

2011S06688 M00054PURPOSE OF THE BILL:
2011S06688 M00055
2011S06688 M00056The proposed legislation would eliminate or reduce a significant number
2011S06688 M00057of legislative mandates and provide greater flexibility relating to
2011S06688 M00058transportation, educational management services and special education
2011S06688 M00059requirements.
2011S06688 M00060
2011S06688 M00061SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL:
2011S06688 M00062
2011S06688 M00063Section 1 would amend §810 of the education law to eliminate the
2011S06688 M00064requirement that public schools assemble their students on Conservation
2011S06688 M00065Day to provide instructionally related activities related to conserva-
2011S06688 M00066tion. Instead, this section provides districts with flexibility in cele-
2011S06688 M00067brating Earth Day.
2011S06688 M00068
2011S06688 M00069Section 2 would add a new paragraph to § 1950(4) of the education law to
2011S06688 M00070clarify that BOCES have the authority to contract for telecommunications
2011S06688 M00071equipment on behalf of their component school districts.
2011S06688 M00072
2011S06688 M00073Section 3 would add a new subdivision to §3035 of the education law to
2011S06688 M00074eliminate duplicative fingerprints for school bus drivers. Currently,
2011S06688 M00075the State requires a second set of fingerprints for school bus drivers
2011S06688 M00076who have already been certified under §509-cc of the vehicle and traffic
2011S06688 M00077law. This section also authorizes the Division of Criminal Justice to
2011S06688 M00078provide subsequent criminal history notifications directly to the
2011S06688 M00079Commissioner upon notification that a prospective employee has been
2011S06688 M00080cleared for employment.
2011S06688 M00081
2011S06688 M00082Section 4 would repeal §3641(4)(d) to eliminate state requirements for
2011S06688 M00083reporting beyond the federal requirements of the Asbestos Hazard Emer-
2011S06688 M00084gency Response Act (AHERA).
2011S06688 M00085
2011S06688 M00086Sections 5 and 5-a would amend §305(14)(a) of the education law to
2011S06688 M00087authorize that certain contracts may be advertised in the state's
2011S06688 M00088procurement opportunities newsletter in accordance with article 4-C of
2011S06688 M00089the economic development law and to eliminate the that contracts for the
2011S06688 M00090maintenance and operation of cafeteria or restaurant services be compet-
2011S06688 M00091itively bid.
2011S06688 M00092
2011S06688 M00093Section 6 would amend §305(14)(e) of the education law and section 9
2011S06688 M00094would amend § 103(1-c) of the general municipal law to allow for trans-
2011S06688 M00095portation and cafeteria contracts to be awarded through a request for
2011S06688 M00096proposals process based on "best value". Currently, State law requires
2011S06688 M00097the awarding of school district contracts to lowest, responsible
2011S06688 M00098bidders. For complex technical and service contracts, this would allow
2011S06688 M00099districts to consider other factors in awarding contracts. This might
2011S06688 M00000.SO DOC S 6688                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S06688 M00100include costs, such as conversion costs, rather than solely the price
2011S06688 M00101bid for a product.
2011S06688 M00102
2011S06688 M00103Section 7 would amend §305(l4) of the education law to add a new para-
2011S06688 M00104graph (g) to authorize the piggybacking of transportation contracts
2011S06688 M00105
2011S06688 M00106between districts that contract with a private transportation contrac-
2011S06688 M00107tor.
2011S06688 M00108
2011S06688 M00109Section 8 would amend § 103(1-b) of the general municipal law to expand
2011S06688 M00110a district's ability to purchase goods and services under general
2011S06688 M00111services administration contracts.
2011S06688 M00112
2011S06688 M00113Sections 10 and 10-a would amend § 103(2) of the general municipal law
2011S06688 M00114to provide local governments with the option of advertising procurement
2011S06688 M00115bids in the state's opportunities newsletter.
2011S06688 M00116
2011S06688 M00117Section 11 would amend §6-0107(1) of the environmental conservation law
2011S06688 M00118to eliminate compliance with the smart growth legislation adopted as
2011S06688 M00119Chapter 433 of the Laws of 2010 for reconstruction projects, reno-
2011S06688 M00120vations, repairs or improvements of existing public school facilities or
2011S06688 M00121existing library facilities, and projects for the construction of new or
2011S06688 M00122expanded public school or library facilities in cities having a popu-
2011S06688 M00123lation of more than 125,000 inhabitants.
2011S06688 M00124
2011S06688 M00125Section 12 would amend §375(20) of the vehicle and traffic law to elimi-
2011S06688 M00126nate the requirement for back-lit school bus signs. This would encourage
2011S06688 M00127districts to replace such back-lit school bus signs with federally
2011S06688 M00128compliant reflective materials, consistent with the provision currently
2011S06688 M00129in place in 48 out of 50 states. This section does not require the
2011S06688 M00130retrofitting of school buses purchased prior to the effective date of
2011S06688 M00131this act.
2011S06688 M00132
2011S06688 M00133Section 13 would repeal §353(15) of the executive law which requires
2011S06688 M00134school districts to provide a form to parents of certain children with
2011S06688 M00135disabilities who are veterans of the Vietnam war for a report to the
2011S06688 M00136Division of Veterans' Affairs for research purposes.
2011S06688 M00137
2011S06688 M00138Section 14 would authorize a study of the feasibility and desirability
2011S06688 M00139of authorizing school districts and boards of cooperative educational
2011S06688 M00140services (BOCES) to enter national credit card contracts as a cost-sav-
2011S06688 M00141ing measure, with appropriate safeguards. Such contracts could poten-
2011S06688 M00142tially provide cost savings or revenues for districts, particularly
2011S06688 M00143where rebates are offered based on volume of purchases.
2011S06688 M00144
2011S06688 M00145Section 15 would repeal § 1950(17) of the education law to eliminate the
2011S06688 M00146requirement for five-year BOCES special education space requirement
2011S06688 M00147plans.
2011S06688 M00148
2011S06688 M00149Section 16 would amend §2215 of the education law by adding a new subdi-
2011S06688 M00150vision 17 to replace the BOCES special education space plan requirement
2011S06688 M00151with a general provision that school districts and BOCES must ensure the
2011S06688 M00152stability and continuity of program placements for students with disa-
2011S06688 M00153bilities, including procedures that ensure that special education
2011S06688 M00154programs and services located in appropriate facilities will not be
2011S06688 M00155relocated without adequate consideration of the needs of participating
2011S06688 M00156students with disabilities.
2011S06688 M00157
2011S06688 M00158Section 17 would amend §2590-b(4)(b)(2) and sections 18 and 18-a would
2011S06688 M00159amend §2853(4)(a) of the education law to make conforming changes to
2011S06688 M00160remove references to subcommittees on special education.
2011S06688 M00161
2011S06688 M00162Section 19 would amend §3602-c of the education law to clarify the defi-
2011S06688 M00163nition of services and provide that special education services for such
2011S06688 M00164students do not include special classes or integrated co-teaching. The
2011S06688 M00165bill would clarify that responsibilities for July and August services
2011S06688 M00166are though the students' school district of location. This provision
2011S06688 M00167would also change the date from June 1 to April 1 for a parent to
2011S06688 M00168request special education services. Finally, the section would make
2011S06688 M00169mediation mandatory where due process complaints are sought prior to any
2011S06688 M00170request for an impartial hearing.
2011S06688 M00171
2011S06688 M00172Section 20 would amend §3602-c(7) of the education law to establish
2011S06688 M00173regional rate methodologies for billing to districts for costs of
2011S06688 M00174services, evaluations and special education administration.
2011S06688 M00175
2011S06688 M00176Section 21 would amend §3604(8) of the education law to allow districts
2011S06688 M00177to schedule superintendent conference days in the last weeks of August
2011S06688 M00178to provide flexibility to districts with regard to meeting their
2011S06688 M00179requirement to hold 180 regular days of session. This amendment would
2011S06688 M00180not alter the responsibility of the school district to provide transpor-
2011S06688 M00181tation to non-public elementary and secondary schools or charter
2011S06688 M00182schools.
2011S06688 M00183

2011S06688 M00185sioner of Education's authority to appoint students to state-supported

2011S06688 M00189ty of the commissioner of education to make appointments to state-sup-
2011S06688 M00190ported schools.
2011S06688 M00191
2011S06688 M00192Section 24 of the bill would amend §4203 of the education law and
2011S06688 M00193section 25 would amend §4204(3) of the education law to remove refer-
2011S06688 M00194ences to the Commissioner of Education's authority to appoint student to
2011S06688 M00195state-supported schools and to clarify that placement of pupils to

2011S06688 M00197committee on special education, or committee on preschool special educa-

2011S06688 M00234mittees on special education.
2011S06688 M00235
2011S06688 M00236Section 33 would repeal §4402(1)(b)(3)(h) of the education law to remove
2011S06688 M00237the requirement to file certain reports on students with disabilities

2011S06688 M00276parent prior to the initial placement of the student in a July/August
2011S06688 M00277program recommended by the committee on special education.
2011S06688 M00278
2011S06688 M00279Section 41 would amend §4402(4)(d) of the education law to provide that
2011S06688 M00280where the board of education of a student's school district of residence
2011S06688 M00281provides transportation up to a distance of fifty miles to and from a
2011S06688 M00282nonpublic school which a student identified with a disability attends
2011S06688 M00283for the purpose of receiving services or programs from the non-public
2011S06688 M00284school which are similar to special education programs and services
2011S06688 M00285recommended for the student by the district of residence, the student
2011S06688 M00286would not be entitled to special education programs and services from
2011S06688 M00287the school district of location pursuant to §3602-c of the education
2011S06688 M00288law.
2011S06688 M00289
2011S06688 M00290Section 42 would repeal §4403(18) of the education law which requires
2011S06688 M00291the Commissioner of Education to approve the provision of early inter-
2011S06688 M00292vention services by approved preschool providers.
2011S06688 M00293
2011S06688 M00294Section 43 would amend §4404(1)(a) of the education law to provide that
2011S06688 M00295a due process hearing must be requested within one year of the date the
2011S06688 M00296parent or district had knowledge of the underlying issue with an excep-
2011S06688 M00297tion that for parents seeking tuition reimbursement such request must be

2011S06688 M00298made within 180 days of the date the parent placed his/her child in the
2011S06688 M00299private school.
2011S06688 M00300
2011S06688 M00301Section 44 would amend §4410(3)(a)(1) of the education law to repeal the
2011S06688 M00302requirement that the committee on preschool special education membership
2011S06688 M00303must include an additional parent of a child with a disability whose
2011S06688 M00304child is enrolled in a preschool or elementary level education program.
2011S06688 M00305
2011S06688 M00306Section 45 would amend §4410(4)(b) of the education law to repeal the
2011S06688 M00307requirement that the parent selects the preschool evaluator. The bill
2011S06688 M00308would replace this provision with the requirement that each board shall,
2011S06688 M00309within the time limits established by the commissioner, be responsible
2011S06688 M00310for providing the parent of a preschool child suspected of having a
2011S06688 M00311disability, with a list of approved evaluators in the geographic area.
2011S06688 M00312This section would also require that the school district consider the
2011S06688 M00313parent's expressed preference, if any, in the selection of the evalu-
2011S06688 M00314ator.
2011S06688 M00315
2011S06688 M00316Section 46 would amend §4410(9-a) of the education law to establish that
2011S06688 M00317all school districts are approved evaluators of preschool students
2011S06688 M00318suspected of having a disability without the need to submit an applica-
2011S06688 M00319tion to the state education department.
2011S06688 M00320
2011S06688 M00321Section 47 would amend §4410-b(1)(c) of the education law to conform
2011S06688 M00322language and remove references to subcommittees on special education.
2011S06688 M00323
2011S06688 M00324Section 48 is the effective date. This section also provides that noth-
2011S06688 M00325ing in section 12 shall be construed to require the retrofitting of
2011S06688 M00326school buses purchased prior to the effective date of the act.
2011S06688 M00327
2011S06688 M00328STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL:
2011S06688 M00329
2011S06688 M00330As school districts adjust to the tax cap and the loss of federal and
2011S06688 M00331state funds, mandate relief becomes vital in order to preserve funding
2011S06688 M00332for critical priorities. While many mandates were originally enacted to
2011S06688 M00333enhance the rights, protections and performance of students and the
2011S06688 M00334fiscal accountability of school districts, not all mandates have
2011S06688 M00335produced their intended results. In these fiscal times, it is imperative
2011S06688 M00336that a thoughtful and targeted series of changes be made to repeal
2011S06688 M00337mandates that have grown too burdensome and costly and which are not
2011S06688 M00338essential to improving results for students.
2011S06688 M00339
2011S06688 M00340The proposed legislation would eliminate or reduce a significant number
2011S06688 M00341of legislative mandates and provide greater flexibility relating to
2011S06688 M00342transportation, educational management services and special education.
2011S06688 M00343
2011S06688 M00344Transportation Mandate Relief
2011S06688 M00345
2011S06688 M00346The bill amends §3035 of the education law to eliminate duplicative
2011S06688 M00347fingerprints for school bus drivers. Currently, the State requires a
2011S06688 M00348second set of fingerprints for school bus drivers who have already been
2011S06688 M00349certified under §509-cc of the vehicle and traffic law. This provision
2011S06688 M00350would authorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to forward a copy of a
2011S06688 M00351prospective employee's criminal history record and fingerprints to the
2011S06688 M00352commissioner of education to complete the Department's review of the
2011S06688 M00353prospective employee. Upon notification that the employee has been
2011S06688 M00354cleared for employment by the commissioner, the Division of Criminal
2011S06688 M00355Justice Services would have the authority to provide any additional
2011S06688 M00356subsequent criminal history notifications directly to the commissioner.
2011S06688 M00357
2011S06688 M00358Proposed amendments to §305(14)(a) of the education law would authorize
2011S06688 M00359contracts for the transportation of school children, to maintain school
2011S06688 M00360buses owned or leased by a school district, contracts for mobile
2011S06688 M00361instructional units, and contracts to provide, maintain and operate
2011S06688 M00362cafeteria or restaurant service by a private food service management
2011S06688 M00363company to be advertised in the state's procurement opportunities news-
2011S06688 M00364letter in accordance with article 4-C of the economic development law.
2011S06688 M00365This is anticipated to provide greater visibility for procurement oppor-
2011S06688 M00366tunities and as a result, increase competition and ultimately result in
2011S06688 M00367anticipated cost-savings to the district.
2011S06688 M00368
2011S06688 M00369Section 375(20) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law would be amended to elim-
2011S06688 M00370inate the requirement for back-lit school bus signs. This would encour-
2011S06688 M00371age districts to replace such back-lit school bus signs with federally
2011S06688 M00372compliant reflective materials, consistent with the provision currently
2011S06688 M00373in place in 48 out of 50 states. This provision would not require school
2011S06688 M00374buses purchased prior to the effective date of this act, to be retro-
2011S06688 M00375fitted to comply with this provision.
2011S06688 M00376
2011S06688 M00377Educational Management Services Mandate Relief
2011S06688 M00378
2011S06688 M00379The proposed legislation would provide operational efficiencies for
2011S06688 M00380Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) and school districts.
2011S06688 M00381
2011S06688 M00382Currently, BOCES can operate service school district equipment used for
2011S06688 M00383telecommunications, and technology services and computer networks, and
2011S06688 M00384can engage in cooperative purchasing. Several BOCES already offer the
2011S06688 M00385ability to contract for telecommunications on behalf of their component
2011S06688 M00386districts as a Cooperative Service (CoSer).  When procuring high-tech
2011S06688 M00387equipment, this act would allow BOCES to coordinate contracts for these
2011S06688 M00388purchases on one or more school districts behalf, ensuring that the
2011S06688 M00389school district equipment is compatible with BOCES telecommunication and
2011S06688 M00390network equipment and allowing BOCES and district personnel to effi-
2011S06688 M00391ciently service the equipment.
2011S06688 M00392
2011S06688 M00393Amendments to §305(14)(e) of the education law and §103 of the general
2011S06688 M00394municipal law would eliminate the requirement that contracts for mainte-
2011S06688 M00395nance and operation of cafeteria or restaurant services be competitively
2011S06688 M00396bid. Instead, this act would allow these contracts and transportation
2011S06688 M00000.SO DOC S 6688                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S06688 M00397contracts to be awarded through a request for proposals process by "best
2011S06688 M00398value".  Currently, State law stipulates that school district contracts
2011S06688 M00399be awarded to the lowest, responsible bidder. For complex technical and
2011S06688 M00400service contracts, this would allow districts to consider other factors
2011S06688 M00401in awarding contracts. This might include costs, such as conversion
2011S06688 M00402costs, rather than solely the price bid for a product.  Section 103 of
2011S06688 M00403the general municipal law is also amended to provide school districts
2011S06688 M00404with the option of publishing procurement notices in the Contract Repor-
2011S06688 M00405ter instead of publishing in newspapers. Under current law districts are
2011S06688 M00406required to advertise in official newspapers designated by the board of
2011S06688 M00407education when placing legal notices.  This option would reduce adver-
2011S06688 M00408tising costs and provide access to a greater audience leading to greater
2011S06688 M00409interest and ultimately better pricing for districts.
2011S06688 M00410
2011S06688 M00411The proposed amendments to §305(14) of the Education Law and §103(1-b)
2011S06688 M00412of the General Municipal would expand a school district and/or BOCES
2011S06688 M00413authority to purchase goods and services under a general services admin-
2011S06688 M00414istration contract and authorize the piggybacking of transportation
2011S06688 M00415contracts between districts that contract with a private transportation
2011S06688 M00416contractor.  These amendments would create efficiencies and cost-savings
2011S06688 M00417to districts and BOCES across the State.
2011S06688 M00418
2011S06688 M00419The bill would authorize a study of the feasibility and desirability of
2011S06688 M00420authorizing school districts and BOCES to enter national credit card
2011S06688 M00421
2011S06688 M00422contracts as a cost-saving measure, with appropriate safeguards.  Such
2011S06688 M00423contracts could potentially provide cost savings or revenues for
2011S06688 M00424districts, particularly where rebates are offered based on volume of
2011S06688 M00425purchases.
2011S06688 M00426
2011S06688 M00427Education law §3641(4)(d) is repealed to eliminate state requirements
2011S06688 M00428for reporting beyond the federal requirements of the Asbestos Hazard
2011S06688 M00429Emergency Response Act (AHERA).  AHERA requires all public and non-publ-
2011S06688 M00430ic elementary schools to develop and implement measures to determine if
2011S06688 M00431asbestos is present and how to manage and safely monitor it over time.
2011S06688 M00432The state has enacted additional laws over and above the federal
2011S06688 M00433mandate. The capital planning process already provides safeguards for
2011S06688 M00434testing for asbestos and other hazardous materials, requires that
2011S06688 M00435districts hire professional consultants to conduct the process and that
2011S06688 M00436all work be carried out in accordance with code. As asbestos monitoring
2011S06688 M00437and compliance with AHERA is a federal responsibility administered by
2011S06688 M00438the EPA, safeguards are already in place and enactment of this provision
2011S06688 M00439would reduce a duplicative burden upon the department and school
2011S06688 M00440districts.
2011S06688 M00441
2011S06688 M00442The bill also eliminates the mandate for school districts to observe
2011S06688 M00443Conservation Day and assemble students and provide instructionally
2011S06688 M00444related activities on that day. Instead, the bill replaces Conservation
2011S06688 M00445Day with Earth Day and gives districts the flexibility to find the best
2011S06688 M00446utilization of their curriculum and resources to embed instruction
2011S06688 M00447related to the earth's natural environment sometime during the academic
2011S06688 M00448year of instruction.
2011S06688 M00449
2011S06688 M00450Finally, section 6-0107(1) of the environmental conservation law is
2011S06688 M00451amended to eliminate compliance with the "Small Growth" legislation
2011S06688 M00452enacted pursuant to Chapter 433 of the Laws of 2010 for improvements to
2011S06688 M00453existing structures. Under current statute, all school districts must
2011S06688 M00454conduct "Smart Growth Impact Statements" to ensure capital construction
2011S06688 M00455projects are aligned with recently developed smart growth criteria to
2011S06688 M00456avoid urban sprawl and reduce urban blight.
2011S06688 M00457
2011S06688 M00458The first criterion of the "Smart Growth Criteria" is to encourage the
2011S06688 M00459reuse of existing infrastructure thereby negating need for new develop-
2011S06688 M00460ment. Since nearly 95% of school projects involve the rehabilitation of
2011S06688 M00461existing facilities for continued use as schools, the bill eliminates an
2011S06688 M00462onerous and unnecessary mandate on districts and State Education Depart-
2011S06688 M00463ment staff by eliminating "Smart Growth Impact Statements."
2011S06688 M00464
2011S06688 M00465Special Education Mandate Relief
2011S06688 M00466
2011S06688 M00467The repeal and amendments to the special education provisions recom-
2011S06688 M00468mended in this legislation will provide both potential cost savings as
2011S06688 M00469well as necessary relief from administrative tasks and increased flexi-
2011S06688 M00470bility on how schools may best utilize their existing resources while
2011S06688 M00471continuing to provide procedural protections and ensure that students
2011S06688 M00472with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education as
2011S06688 M00473required by federal law.
2011S06688 M00474
2011S06688 M00475The proposed amendment to education law § 1950(17) would eliminate the
2011S06688 M00476requirement for five-year BOCES special education space requirement
2011S06688 M00477plans and would replace this requirement with a general provision that
2011S06688 M00478school districts and BOCES must ensure the stability and continuity of
2011S06688 M00479program placements for students with disabilities, including procedures
2011S06688 M00480that ensure that special education programs and services located in
2011S06688 M00481appropriate facilities will not be relocated without adequate consider-
2011S06688 M00482ation of the needs of participating students with disabilities.  The
2011S06688 M00483repeal of the BOCES space planning requirements is likely to result in
2011S06688 M00484an estimated $1 million savings to the State, BOCES and school districts
2011S06688 M00485over five years. Factors considered include costs associated with 32
2011S06688 M00486space plans developed once every five years but updated and approved
2011S06688 M00487annually which include BOCES and multi-district participation in plan-
2011S06688 M00488ning meetings, data collection and analysis, report development and SED
2011S06688 M00489review and approval.
2011S06688 M00490
2011S06688 M00491The proposed amendments to §3602-c of the education law relating to the
2011S06688 M00492provision of special education to parentally-placed nonpublic schools
2011S06688 M00493are based on recommendations made by a group of representatives of
2011S06688 M00494nonpublic school, parents, teachers, superintendents of schools, school
2011S06688 M00495administrators and school board members convened by SED to discuss how
2011S06688 M00000.SO DOC S 6688                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S06688 M00496changes to state law would result in time, cost and service provision
2011S06688 M00497efficiencies, while balancing the need of school districts to avoid
2011S06688 M00498unnecessary costs, reduce disputes over billing issues and due process
2011S06688 M00499complaints and have timely notice that districts need to budget and make
2011S06688 M00500arrangement for services to dually enrolled students with disabilities.
2011S06688 M00501Specifically, the bill would clarify the definition of education
2011S06688 M00502services and provide that special education services for such students
2011S06688 M00503do not include special classes or integrated co-teaching; clarify that
2011S06688 M00504responsibilities for July and August services are through students'
2011S06688 M00505school district of location; change the date from June 1 to April 1 for
2011S06688 M00506a parent to request special education services from the district of
2011S06688 M00507location; specify that if a student is first identified as a student
2011S06688 M00508with a disability after June 1, the parent would have 30 day s from the
2011S06688 M00509development of the individualized education services program (IESP) to
2011S06688 M00510file a request for services with the district of location. To address
2011S06688 M00511concerns that too many disputes under Education Law §3602-c are proceed-
2011S06688 M00512ing to due process hearings which are costly to school districts and
2011S06688 M00513burdensome on both school districts and parents, this bill would make
2011S06688 M00514mediation mandatory where due process complaints are sought prior to any
2011S06688 M00515request for an impartial hearing and require the commissioner to estab-
2011S06688 M00516lish a timeframe under which the mediation session must be conducted so
2011S06688 M00517as not to delay a parent's right to due process.
2011S06688 M00518
2011S06688 M00519This bill would also authorize the commissioner of education to estab-
2011S06688 M00520lish regional rate methodologies that districts may use for billing to
2011S06688 M00521districts for costs of services, evaluations and special education
2011S06688 M00522administration for parentally-placed students with disabilities. School
2011S06688 M00523districts of location would be able to elect to use these rate methodol-
2011S06688 M00524ogies to compute regional rates for billing for all nonresident students
2011S06688 M00525receiving services under §3602-c(2) or could choose to compute actual
2011S06688 M00526costs on an individual student basis for all qualified nonresident
2011S06688 M00527
2011S06688 M00528students. The section would also make a technical correction to remove
2011S06688 M00529language that suggests that a chargeback may be made for due process
2011S06688 M00530costs, to conform to authorized costs designated in education law
2011S06688 M00531§3602-c(7)(b). These amendments address concerns expressed by school
2011S06688 M00532officials about the burden and costliness of having to compute costs on
2011S06688 M00533an individual basis through the proposal that the State establish
2011S06688 M00534regional rates for certain evaluations and services which the districts
2011S06688 M00535would have the option of using. Further, the proposed amendments to
2011S06688 M00536§3602-c(7) would provide districts of location one year from the end of

2011S06688 M00538days from the effective date of this act, whichever is later.  By estab-
2011S06688 M00539lishing a reasonable time within which claims must be presented, this
2011S06688 M00540bill would assure that claims are processed in a timely manner and that
2011S06688 M00541districts of residence are not confronted by claims for multiple years
2011S06688 M00542that are difficult to verify because of the passage of time.
2011S06688 M00543
2011S06688 M00544In addition, the bill would make a related amendment to Education Law
2011S06688 M00545§4402(4)(d), to provide that where the board of education of a student's
2011S06688 M00546school district of residence provides transportation up to a distance of
2011S06688 M0054750 miles to and from a non-public school which a student identified with
2011S06688 M00548a disability attends for the purpose of receiving services or programs
2011S06688 M00549from the non-public school which are similar to special education
2011S06688 M00550programs and services recommended for the student by the district of
2011S06688 M00551residence, the student would not be.  entitled to special education
2011S06688 M00552programs and services from the school district of location pursuant to
2011S06688 M00553§3602-c of the education law. As a condition of eligibility for such
2011S06688 M00554transportation, the parent or person in parental relation to the student
2011S06688 M00555would be required to consent to the provision of notice by the school
2011S06688 M00556district of residence to the chairperson of the committee on special
2011S06688 M00557education of the school district in which the nonpublic school is
2011S06688 M00558located. Such notice must be provided by the district of residence no
2011S06688 M00559later than thirty days after commencing transportation services.
2011S06688 M00560
2011S06688 M00561Amendments to §4402 of the education law would more closely align the
2011S06688 M00562membership of the CSE to the federal individualized education program
2011S06688 M00563(IEP) team membership by repealing the requirement that the CSE member-
2011S06688 M00564ship must include an additional parent of a student with a disability
2011S06688 M00565and a school physician. The amendment would limit the mandatory require-
2011S06688 M00566ment for a school psychologist to serve on the committee on special
2011S06688 M00567education, to those meetings which determine a student's initial eligi-
2011S06688 M00568bility for special education services.  Further, the bill would also
2011S06688 M00569amend §4410 of the education law to more closely align the membership of
2011S06688 M00570the committee on preschool special education (CPSE) to the federal IEP
2011S06688 M00571team by repealing the requirement that the CPSE membership must include
2011S06688 M00572an additional parent of a child with a disability whose child is
2011S06688 M00573enrolled in a preschool or elementary level education program. The
2011S06688 M00574Department anticipates costs savings resulting from an elimination of
2011S06688 M00575reimbursement costs for those districts that provide such reimbursements
2011S06688 M00576for additional parent members, for costs associated with the partic-
2011S06688 M00577ipation of the school psychologist at every meeting in addition to the
2011S06688 M00578meeting to determine a student's initial eligibility for special educa-
2011S06688 M00579tion and for costs of rescheduling meetings when the additional parent
2011S06688 M00580
2011S06688 M00581member or school psychologist are not available to attend the scheduled
2011S06688 M00582meetings.
2011S06688 M00583
2011S06688 M00584The proposed repeal of education law §4402(18) provides mandate relief
2011S06688 M00585to the State by repealing the requirement that the commissioner of
2011S06688 M00586education approve programs that would provide both early intervention
2011S06688 M00587services and preschool programs. The Department of Health (DOH) is the
2011S06688 M00588lead agency for early intervention programs and has regulatory standards
2011S06688 M00589by which such approvals must be made. The requirement that SED approve
2011S06688 M00590EI programs results in a duplication of effort between SED and DOH.
2011S06688 M00591
2011S06688 M00592Amendments to §4410(4)(b) of the education law would repeal the require-
2011S06688 M00593ment that parents may select the preschool evaluator and replace it with
2011S06688 M00594the requirement that the school district must, after providing the
2011S06688 M00000.SO DOC S 6688                                   MTXT                 2011
2011S06688 M00595parent with a list of approved preschool evaluators and after obtaining
2011S06688 M00596parental consent to evaluate, arrange for an evaluation by the service
2011S06688 M00597provider selected by the district who can provide the evaluation of the
2011S06688 M00598student within the timeline required by the Sate. In selecting the eval-
2011S06688 M00599uator, the district must consider the parent's expressed preference, if
2011S06688 M00600any, for the evaluator. The bill would also provide relief to the State
2011S06688 M00601and to districts by amending §4410(9-a) of the education law to estab-
2011S06688 M00602lish that all school districts are approved evaluators of preschool
2011S06688 M00603students suspected of having a disability without the need to submit an
2011S06688 M00604application to SED, providing administrative relief to districts while
2011S06688 M00605at the same time addressing the programmatic need for more approved
2011S06688 M00606evaluators of preschool children to ensure their timely evaluations.
2011S06688 M00607
2011S06688 M00608Section 4402(2)(a) of the education law is amended to remove the
2011S06688 M00609requirement that school districts obtain the written consent of the
2011S06688 M00610parent prior to the initial placement of the student in a July/August
2011S06688 M00611program recommended by the committee on special education. This require-
2011S06688 M00612ment for parental consent is not required by federal law.
2011S06688 M00613
2011S06688 M00614Section 4404(1)(a) of the education law is amended to provide that a due
2011S06688 M00615process hearing must be requested within one year of the date the parent
2011S06688 M00616or district had knowledge of the underlying issue. The amendment
2011S06688 M00617provides for exceptions as required by federal law and with an exception
2011S06688 M00618that for parents seeking tuition reimbursement that such request must be
2011S06688 M00619made within 180 days of the date the parent placed his or her child in
2011S06688 M00620the private school. When a claim encompasses multiple school years, the
2011S06688 M00621record in an impartial hearing can become voluminous and the cost of
2011S06688 M00622defending the complaint rises.
2011S06688 M00623
2011S06688 M00624Section 4002(2)(e) of the education law would be amended to remove
2011S06688 M00625references to the Commissioner of Education's authority to appoint
2011S06688 M00626students to state-supported schools.  Conforming changes would be made
2011S06688 M00627to §§4201, 4203, 4401(2), 4402(2)(b)(2) and 4403(17) of the education
2011S06688 M00628law. Section 4204(3) of the education law would also be amended to
2011S06688 M00629remove references to the Commissioner's authority to appoint student to
2011S06688 M00630state-supported schools and to clarify that placement of pupils to
2011S06688 M00631institutions for instruction of the deaf may be recommended by the CSE
2011S06688 M00632or CPSE where applicable, of the school district responsible for educat-
2011S06688 M00633
2011S06688 M00634ing the student, and may include the provision of special education
2011S06688 M00635programs and services in July or August in accordance with the
2011S06688 M00636provisions of §4402(2)(a). Similarly, §4206 of the education law would
2011S06688 M00637be amended to remove references to the Commissioner of Education's
2011S06688 M00638authority to appoint students to institutions for the instruction of the
2011S06688 M00639blind and would clarify that placement in such institutions may be
2011S06688 M00640recommended by the CSE, or CPSE where applicable, of the school district
2011S06688 M00641responsible for educating such student, and may include the provision of
2011S06688 M00642special education programs and services in July or August in accordance
2011S06688 M00643with the provisions of §4402(2)(a). §4207 of the education law would be
2011S06688 M00644amended to remove the Commissioner's authority for appointments to the
2011S06688 M00645New York Institute for Special Education and provides that the committee
2011S06688 M00646on special education of the school district responsible for the educa-
2011S06688 M00647tion of the pupil has the authority to recommend extension of the term
2011S06688 M00648of any pupil attending the institution.  §4213 of the education law
2011S06688 M00649would be amended to conform language and remove references of appoint-
2011S06688 M00650ments to the New York Institute for Special Education.
2011S06688 M00651
2011S06688 M00652Education law §4402(1)(b)(3)(d-2) would be repealed which currently
2011S06688 M00653require boards of education to develop plans and policies for appropri-
2011S06688 M00654ate declassification of students with disabilities. Federal law requires
2011S06688 M00655that each child with a disability be reevaluated at least once every
2011S06688 M00656three years to determine a student's continuing eligibility for special
2011S06688 M00657education and to require a reevaluation of a student prior to declassi-
2011S06688 M00658fication. Therefore, it is not necessary for boards of education to
2011S06688 M00659establish additional plans and policies.
2011S06688 M00660
2011S06688 M00661The bill also proposes to amend §4402(1)(b)(3)(h) of the education law
2011S06688 M00662to remove the outdated requirement to file certain reports on students
2011S06688 M00663with disabilities who are the children of Vietnam Veterans.
2011S06688 M00664
2011S06688 M00665Federal law establishes transition planning requirements on school
2011S06688 M00666districts, including the requirement to invite potential transition
2011S06688 M00667providers, which could include adult service agencies, to CSE meetings
2011S06688 M00668to prepare a student for transition to adult life. To streamline these
2011S06688 M00669requirements, education law §4402(1)(b) (5) and (7) would be amended to
2011S06688 M00670provide at the first annual review of a student with a disability placed
2011S06688 M00671in a residential program or a student determined by the committee on
2011S06688 M00672special education or multidisciplinary team likely to require adult
2011S06688 M00673residential services after the student has attained the age of 18, for
2011S06688 M00674the development adult service recommendations. Upon consent of the
2011S06688 M00675student's parents or the student themselves if over the age of 18, the
2011S06688 M00676committee on special education or the multidisciplinary team shall
2011S06688 M00677invite representatives from the Office of Mental Health (OMH), Office
2011S06688 M00678for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) or the State Educa-
2011S06688 M00679tion Department (SED) to participate in such recommendations and upon
2011S06688 M00680consented release of the student's information, refer the student to the
2011S06688 M00681appropriate public agency for services. These amendments would utilize
2011S06688 M00682appropriate language, consistent throughout education law, to provide
2011S06688 M00683for transitional programs for those students with a disability who have
2011S06688 M00684reached the age of 18 and who are placed in a residential program by
2011S06688 M00685their CSE or multidisciplinary team and day students with a disability
2011S06688 M00686
2011S06688 M00687who have reached the age of 18 and whose CSE or multidisciplinary team
2011S06688 M00688has determined that it is likely the student will require adult residen-
2011S06688 M00689tial services.

2011S06692 M00009
2011S06692 M00010This bill would strengthen the Banking Development District (BDD)
2011S06692 M00011program by clarifying the goals of the program and the criteria by which
2011S06692 M00012a branch's effectiveness should be measured.

2011S06692 M00014SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S06692 M00015
2011S06692 M00016This bill amends Section 96-d (6) of the Banking Law by adding new
2011S06692 M00017subdivisions (a) and (b).
2011S06692 M00018
2011S06692 M00019Subdivision (a) would require BDD branch's to provide affordable
2011S06692 M00020products and services, which include financial educational services
2011S06692 M00021within their community, and Subdivision (b), would require participating
2011S06692 M00022BDD branch's to meet certain criteria in order to qualify for renewal of
2011S06692 M00023their deposit.
2011S06692 M00024
2011S06692 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06692 M00026
2011S06692 M00027The Banking Development District (BDD) Program was created in 1997 to
2011S06692 M00028provide an incentive to banks to promote the establishment of new bank
2011S06692 M00029branches in communities with. no or few branches and thereby stimulate
2011S06692 M00030the opening of bank accounts by community residents. The incentive of
2011S06692 M00031public deposits and other benefits provided to those banks that open a
2011S06692 M00032BDD branch in underserved communities is to better ensure that the new
2011S06692 M00033branch will have sufficient deposits to provide loans and other
2011S06692 M00034services.
2011S06692 M00035
2011S06692 M00036The Banking Department conducted a study of the BDD Program that was
2011S06692 M00037published in 2010 which identified "next steps" to be taken to improve
2011S06692 M00038the program based on feedback collected from the banks, community groups
2011S06692 M00039and other stakeholders involved in the BDD Program.  This bill is based
2011S06692 M00040on the results of that study as well as on a Roundtable held by the
2011S06692 M00041Assembly Banks Committee in October 2011 on the BDD Program. While the
2011S06692 M00042BDD Program has been very effective, both the Banking Department study
2011S06692 M00043and the Assembly Roundtable identified several features of the Program
2011S06692 M00044where legislative clarification would be appropriate. Specifically, the
2011S06692 M00045findings included a need to clarify the goals of the program; provide
2011S06692 M00046standards by which renewals of deposits could better be measured: and,
2011S06692 M00047require branches participating in the program to provide financial
2011S06692 M00048education to members of the district in which it is located. This bill
2011S06692 M00049seeks to address those findings.

2011S06694 M00012synthetic cannabinoids often known as K2, Spike 99, Spice, Yucatan Fire,
2011S06694 M00013Genie, Zohai and many others) and substituted cathinones (these
2011S06694 M00014products, often referred to as "bath salts," are chemically related to
2011S06694 M00015methamphetamines and ecstasy - which are both classified as stimulants)
2011S06694 M00016as controlled substances under the public health law and the penal law,
2011S06694 M00017and to create a Statewide Synthetic Cannabinoid and Substituted Cathi-
2011S06694 M00018none Amnesty and Surrender Program to allow for surrender of these harm-
2011S06694 M00019ful substances to appropriate authorities.
2011S06694 M00020
2011S06694 M00021SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06694 M00022Adds synthetic cannabinoids to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as
2011S06694 M00023seven classes based on foundational chemical structures - which should
2011S06694 M00024address the current practice of making minor alterations to chemicals to
2011S06694 M00025subvert statutes that prohibit distinct substances.  Makes penalties for
2011S06694 M00026possession and sale similar to marijuana. These substances are similar
2011S06694 M00027to marijuana in how they are used, the neurochemical impact they illic-
2011S06694 M00028it, and the quantities in which they are sold.
2011S06694 M00029
2011S06694 M00030Adds substituted cathinones to the CSA based on foundational chemical
2011S06694 M00031structures - which should address the current practice of making minor
2011S06694 M00032alterations to chemicals to subvert statutes that prohibit distinct
2011S06694 M00033chemicals. A direct reference to "methcathinone" is removed because it
2011S06694 M00034fits within the class. Makes penalties for possession and sale similar
2011S06694 M00035to other stimulants, because these products often referred to as "bath
2011S06694 M00036salts," are chemically related to methamphetamines and ecstasy - which
2011S06694 M00037are both classified as stimulants.
2011S06694 M00038
2011S06694 M00039Requires provisions to allow for the surrender of these substances
2011S06694 M00040during the 90 day period after enactment of the law to the appropriate
2011S06694 M00041authorities and requires that a database be maintained to increase
2011S06694 M00042awareness of these products and their harmful effects.
2011S06694 M00043
2011S06694 M00044EXISTING LAW:
2011S06694 M00045Currently, these products are not prohibited under either the public
2011S06694 M00046health law or the penal law, despite the harm to the individuals who
2011S06694 M00047consume them and the public.
2011S06694 M00048
2011S06694 M00049JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06694 M00050
2011S06694 M00051Many recent news reports have brought to light the use of a legal herb-
2011S06694 M00052like product that is laced with a synthetic cannabinoid that is being
2011S06694 M00053smoked by individuals, including teens, as "fake weed," as well as the
2011S06694 M00054substituted cathinones, known as "bath salts." While producing a high
2011S06694 M00055similar to existing controlled substances, these legal substances can
2011S06694 M00056have more dangerous side effects reported include hallucinations, vomit-
2011S06694 M00057ing, agitation, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure and other
2011S06694 M00058adverse conditions. It presents a grave risk to public health and safety
2011S06694 M00059to allow these to continue to be available to the public.
2011S06694 M00060
2011S06694 M00061These products can often be legally purchased in head shops, smoke
2011S06694 M00062shops, tobacco shops or novelty shops. It can also be legally purchased
2011S06694 M00063by mail or on the Internet. In fact, the product is often marketed as
2011S06694 M00064incense or potpourri or bath salts.
2011S06694 M00065
2011S06694 M00066Many states have already taken action against these substances, includ-
2011S06694 M00067ing New Jersey and it is past time for New York to act as well.

2011S06695 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S06695 M00004An act to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing the
2011S06695 M00005office of the law enforcement inspector general
2011S06695 M00006
2011S06695 M00007PURPOSE:
2011S06695 M00008To establish an independent state inspector general for law enforcement
2011S06695 M00009and agencies involved in intelligence gathering.
2011S06695 M00010
2011S06695 M00011SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06695 M00012Section 1 - Establishes the office of law enforcement inspector general
2011S06695 M00013organized under a new article.
2011S06695 M00014
2011S06695 M00015This section creates the authority of the office to include all state
2011S06695 M00016and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies operating in New
2011S06695 M00017York. It further establishes the powers and duties of the inspector
2011S06695 M00018general. This section also mandates reporting requirements.

2011S06695 M00025JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06695 M00026Protecting the public trust from waste, fraud, and abuse is a principle
2011S06695 M00027established by the founders of our nation. In 1777, President Washington
2011S06695 M00028appointed an New Yorker, Friedrich W. A. von Steuben as an inspector
2011S06695 M00029general of the Army (Patricia Salkin & Zachary Kansler, Ensuring Public
2011S06695 M00030Trust at the Municipal Level:  Inspectors General Enter the Mix, Albany
2011S06695 M00031Law Review Vol. 75, No.1).
2011S06695 M00032
2011S06695 M00033Over the years we have found the need to establish inspectors general
2011S06695 M00034throughout New York. In 1873, the Legislature established commissioner
2011S06695 M00035of accounts to investigate corruption in New York City.  Since then, the
2011S06695 M00036office State Inspector General and most recently the Medicaid Inspector
2011S06695 M00037General were created. These institutions ensure transparency and
2011S06695 M00038accountability.
2011S06695 M00039
2011S06695 M00040According to a recent report by Professor James Steiner, Improving Home-
2011S06695 M00041land Security at the State Level, Needed: State-level, Integrated Intel-
2011S06695 M00042ligence Enterprises at least 1,500 - 1,600 field intelligence officers
2011S06695 M00043operate throughout New York state. These officers are full-time law
2011S06695 M00044enforcement officers who also serve as intelligence officers and are
2011S06695 M00045directed by the New York State Intelligence Center.
2011S06695 M00046
2011S06695 M00047In addition, according to the Washington Post's report Top Secret Ameri-
2011S06695 M00048ca, there are at least 1,000 officers in the New York police Department
2011S06695 M00049that engage in intelligence and counter-terrorism activities. Recent
2011S06695 M00050reports by the Associated Press reveal that the NYPD has conducted
2011S06695 M00051surveillance operations based on religion. The NYPD engaged in surveil-
2011S06695 M00052
2011S06695 M00053lance of college students, businesses, non-profit organizations, and
2011S06695 M00054religious organizations well beyond their jurisdiction including other
2011S06695 M00055states. Through various federal programs, we know the New York police
2011S06695 M00056Department and other law enforcement agencies have received billions in
2011S06695 M00057federal funding since the tragic attack on September 11, 2001. Unfortu-
2011S06695 M00058nately, very little is known about these entities, the data they
2011S06695 M00059collect, and their operations.
2011S06695 M00060
2011S06695 M00061This bill seeks to ensure that tax dollars are used lawfully and to
2011S06695 M00062prevent waste, fraud, and abuse by state and local law enforcement

2011S06697 M00013
2011S06697 M00014SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06697 M00015Section one amends Elder Law (EL) §242(3)(f) to provide, that as a
2011S06697 M00016condition of continued eligibility for benefits under the Elderly Phar-
2011S06697 M00017maceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC) program, a participant shall enroll
2011S06697 M00018in Medicare Part D at the first available enrollment period.  This
2011S06697 M00019requirement shall be waived if such would result in significant finan-
2011S06697 M00020cial liability to the participant. This section is also amended to
2011S06697 M00021provide that EPIC will pay for the portion of the Part D monthly premium
2011S06697 M00022that is the responsibility of the participant. This payment shall be
2011S06697 M00023limited to the low-income benchmark premium amount established by the
2011S06697 M00024federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). For partic-
2011S06697 M00025ipants with catastrophic coverage, EPIC shall credit the participant's
2011S06697 M00026annual personal covered drug expenditure amount required under this

2011S06697 M00044expenses are paid or reimbursable under provisions of the Medicare
2011S06697 M00045program shall not disqualify otherwise eligible applicants, and restores
2011S06697 M00046the provisions, relating the process for state reimbursement of such.

2011S06697 M00052Section eight amends EL §242(3)(e) to provide that such conditions of
2011S06697 M00053eligibility are only required for continued eligibility.
2011S06697 M00054
2011S06697 M00055Section nine amends EL §242(3)(g) to direct EPIC to conduct an enroll-
2011S06697 M00056ment program.
2011S06697 M00057
2011S06697 M00058Sections 10, 11 and 12 amend the EL to restore previous provisions

2011S06697 M00076by a provider pharmacy only pursuant to the terms of a rebate agreement
2011S06697 M00077between the program and the manufacturer. This section also restores
2011S06697 M00078provisions for when EPIC shall provide reimbursement to participants
2011S06697 M00079qualified for both EPIC and Medicare.
2011S06697 M00080
2011S06697 M00081Section 19 amends EL §254, which pertains to the panel's ability to
2011S06697 M00082adjust individual and joint income categories.
2011S06697 M00083
2011S06697 M00084Section 20 provides that this act shall take effect on April 1, 2012,

2011S06697 M00093care Part D drug plan costs.
2011S06697 M00094
2011S06697 M00095The SFY 2011-12 budget made eliminated many of the components integral
2011S06697 M00096to the EPIC program. These changes required that, beginning July 1,
2011S06697 M000972011, EPIC deductible credits be eliminated. Beginning January 1, 2012,
2011S06697 M00098all members were required to enroll in Medicare Part D prior to obtain-
2011S06697 M00099ing EPIC coverage. Members are also, as of January 1, 2012, responsible

2011S06697 M00100for their Part D deductible and their Part D co-payments, until they
2011S06697 M00101reach the Medicare coverage gap (i.e. the donut hole). Thus, under its
2011S06697 M00102current manifestation, EPIC provides premium assistance to low income
2011S06697 M00103seniors, and only provides supplemental coverage (to lower out-of-pocket
2011S06697 M00104
2011S06697 M00105costs) for Medicare Part D drugs and Medicare Part D excluded drugs when
2011S06697 M00106purchased during the coverage gap. Many seniors rely on the EPIC
2011S06697 M00107program, and as such many were negatively affected by the changes made
2011S06697 M00108to this program in last year's budget. This bill will restore EPIC
2011S06697 M00109deductible and co-payment assistance to its previous state.

2011S06698 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S06698 M00004CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY proposing an amendment
2011S06698 M00005to article 3 of the constitution, in relation to the establishment of
2011S06698 M00006the independent redistricting commission
2011S06698 M00007
2011S06698 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S06698 M00009This resolution, when passed a second time in 2013 and if approved by
2011S06698 M00010the voters of New York State, would amend the constitution to reform
2011S06698 M00011comprehensively the process and substantive criteria used to establish
2011S06698 M00012new state legislative and congressional district lines every ten years.
2011S06698 M00013Among other reforms, the amendment would create an independent redis-
2011S06698 M00014tricting commission to draw the legislative and congressional district
2011S06698 M00015lines; require that new district lines be drawn in such manner as to
2011S06698 M00016protect minority voting rights and communities of interest and affirma-
2011S06698 M00017tively explain deviations from population equality for each district;
2011S06698 M00018require extensive public hearings around the state and the commission's
2011S06698 M00019release of all relevant data and draft plans to facilitate public review
2011S06698 M00020and public drafting of proposed district lines; and establish voting
2011S06698 M00021rules in both the commission and in each house of the legislature to
2011S06698 M00022ensure that minority party conferences participate fully in the process
2011S06698 M00023of drawing new lines.
2011S06698 M00024
2011S06698 M00025SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06698 M00026Section 1 would amend sections 4 and 5 of article 3 of the constitution
2011S06698 M00027to establish a new and exclusive process by which new state legislative
2011S06698 M00028and congressional districts shall be drawn. A new independent redis-
2011S06698 M00029tricting commission, selected pursuant to a new section 5-b of the same
2011S06698 M00030article, shall submit to the legislature its proposed district plans,
2011S06698 M00031and the legislature shall vote upon them without amendment. If the
2011S06698 M00032legislature fails to pass such plans twice, it may amend such plans and
2011S06698 M00033then vote upon them. Section I would further establish voting rules to
2011S06698 M00034govern each house's vote upon the independent redistricting commission's
2011S06698 M00035plans that would protect the minority conferences in each house and
2011S06698 M00036ensure the integrity of the commission's plans by requiring approval by
2011S06698 M00037more than a majority of members under certain circumstances. Section 1
2011S06698 M00038would establish substantive principles to govern the drafting and
2011S06698 M00039approval of any district plans. Among other principles that would be
2011S06698 M00040followed in drawing such district lines, this section would require: (1)
2011S06698 M00041the commission to consider whether proposed lines would deny or abridge
2011S06698 M00042racial or language minority voting rights ; (2) no districts be drawn to
2011S06698 M00043have the purpose of, or result in, such denial or abridgement; (3)
2011S06698 M00044districts be drawn so that racial or language minority groups do not
2011S06698 M00045have less opportunity to participate in the political process than other
2011S06698 M00046members of the electorate and to elect representatives of their choice;
2011S06698 M00047(4) districts not be drawn to discourage competition or for the purpose
2011S06698 M00048of favoring or disfavoring incumbents or other particular candidates or
2011S06698 M00049political parties; (5) the commission consider the maintenance of cores
2011S06698 M00050of existing districts, of pre-existing political subdivisions, and of
2011S06698 M00051communities of interest; (6) districts contain as nearly as may be an
2011S06698 M00052
2011S06698 M00053equal number of inhabitants and any deviation in a district shall be
2011S06698 M00054explained specifically by the commission; and (7) districts be contig-
2011S06698 M00055uous and as compact in form as practicable.
2011S06698 M00056
2011S06698 M00057Section 1 would require the commission to hold extensive public hearings
2011S06698 M00058across the state in specified cities and counties, and to make its
2011S06698 M00059drafts and relevant data widely available via the best available tech-
2011S06698 M00060nology. Section I would amend the judicial review provision of this
2011S06698 M00061article to establish a 60-day deadline for decisions in this area, to
2011S06698 M00062establish that a court may find a district plan invalid in whole or in
2011S06698 M00063part if it has been drawn in violation of this article, and to provide
2011S06698 M00064that the court shall provide the legislature an opportunity to address
2011S06698 M00065such legal infirmity in the first instance.
2011S06698 M00066
2011S06698 M00067Section 1 would add a new section 5-b to establish the nature and struc-
2011S06698 M00068ture of the independent redistricting commission. Specifically, the
2011S06698 M00069commission would consist of ten members: two appointees by each of the
2011S06698 M00070four legislative leaders and then two appointees selected by the majori-
2011S06698 M00071ty of those eight members such that least one appointee made by either
2011S06698 M00072of the Assembly or Senate minority leaders must approve those two
2011S06698 M00073members. Neither of those two members may have been enrolled members of
2011S06698 M00074either of the two major political parties in New York State in the last
2011S06698 M00075five years. The amendment further requires that the appointing authori-
2011S06698 M00076ties shall consult with organizations devoted to protecting the voting
2011S06698 M00077rights of minority and other voters concerning their appointments. The
2011S06698 M00078commission members must be registered voters in New York State, but not
2011S06698 M00079have been in the last three years (a) members of the state legislature
2011S06698 M00080or congress or a statewide official or the spouse of any of these
2011S06698 M00081elected officials, (b) a state officer or employee or legislative
2011S06698 M00082employee; (c) a registered lobbyist; or (d) a political party chairman.
2011S06698 M00083
2011S06698 M00084To approve a redistricting plan, the independent redistricting commis-
2011S06698 M00085sion would need to obtain the vote of at least seven of its ten members
2011S06698 M00086in support of the plan. In the event that the commission is unable to
2011S06698 M00087obtain seven votes to approve a redistricting plan, the commission would
2011S06698 M00088have to submit to the legislature that plan (or plans, if two or more
2011S06698 M00089plans garnered an equal number of votes) that garnered the highest
2011S06698 M00090number of votes in support of its approval. The independent redistrict-
2011S06698 M00091ing commission would appoint two co-executive directors of the commis-
2011S06698 M00092sion by approval of a majority of the members of the commission, and the
2011S06698 M00093co-executive directors would appoint commission staff.
2011S06698 M00094
2011S06698 M00095Section 2 provides that the foregoing amendments would be referred to
2011S06698 M00096the first regular legislative session convening after the next succeed-
2011S06698 M00097ing general election of members of the assembly and be published for
2011S06698 M00098three months previous to that election.

2011S06698 M00104JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06698 M00105
2011S06698 M00106The proposed constitutional amendment would implement historic changes
2011S06698 M00107to achieve a fair and readily transparent process by which to draw the
2011S06698 M00108lines of state legislative and congressional districts. It will reform
2011S06698 M00109that process to introduce greater independence, and guarantees the
2011S06698 M00110application of substantive criteria that protect minority voting rights,
2011S06698 M00111communities of interest, and rational line-drawing.
2011S06698 M00112
2011S06698 M00113Adoption of this constitutional amendment will ensure that the drawing
2011S06698 M00114of legislative district lines in New York will be done by a bipartisan,
2011S06698 M00115independent body. By adopting a constitutional amendment the process
2011S06698 M00116will be substantively and fundamentally changed for the future.
2011S06698 M00117
2011S06698 M00118For the first time, both the majority and minority parties in the legis-
2011S06698 M00119lature will have an equal role in the process of drawing lines.  Members
2011S06698 M00120of the commission charged with drawing the lines will have to meet
2011S06698 M00121strict criteria to ensure that they are independent. The process for
2011S06698 M00122adoption of the lines is explicitly laid out in the amendment to provide
2011S06698 M00123transparency and predictability to the process.
2011S06698 M00124
2011S06698 M00125Just as important, the enactment of the constitutional amendment will
2011S06698 M00126give the voters of New York a voice in the adoption of this new process
2011S06698 M00127and by enshrining it in the constitution, ensure that the process will
2011S06698 M00128not be changed without due considerations. _The principle of fair and
2011S06698 M00129open elections will be furthered by the adoption of this amendment. This
2011S06698 M00130far-reaching reform will set the standard for independent redistricting
2011S06698 M00131throughout the United States and provide a template for other states to
2011S06698 M00132follow.

2011S06700 M00022at 253A Fulton Avenue in Hempstead. The property was previously rented
2011S06700 M00023by a store owner who began defaulting on his payments in 2008, and even-
2011S06700 M00024tually abandoned the property in July of 2008. The tenant's breach of
2011S06700 M00025contract left the Calvary Tabernacle owing $70,000 in taxes on property
2011S06700 M00026from which they received no income. This legislation authorizes the
2011S06700 M00027Calvary Tabernacle to submit a retroactive application for a tax
2011S06700 M00028exemption for the time period that it was not receiving rental income.

2011S06701 M00004An act to authorize the assessor of the county of Nassau to accept an
2011S06701 M00005application for exemption from real property tax from the Academy Char-
2011S06701 M00006ter School for a certain parcel of land located in the town of Hempstead
2011S06701 M00007
2011S06701 M00008PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S06701 M00009To authorize the Academy Charter School to file an application for a

2011S06701 M00019
2011S06701 M00020JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06701 M00021The Academy Charter School purchased property located at 117 N.  Frank-
2011S06701 M00022lin Street, Hempstead, on March 30, 2011. The property was purchased for
2011S06701 M00023educational purposes, but due to the timing of the closing, its tax
2011S06701 M00024exempt status did not become effective until January 18, 2012.  Accord-
2011S06701 M00025ingly, this bill allows the organization to retroactively submit an
2011S06701 M00026application for a partial exemption for the 2010-2011 assessment roll,
2011S06701 M00027and an exemption for the 2011-2012 assessment roll.

2011S06702 M00006
2011S06702 M00007PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
2011S06702 M00008This bill would amend the correction law by adding a new section that
2011S06702 M00009establishes a commission on improving prison education.
2011S06702 M00010
2011S06702 M00011SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
2011S06702 M00012Section 1 of adds a new section 49 to the correction law.
2011S06702 M00013
2011S06702 M00014Subsection 1 of this section states that there is hereby established a
2011S06702 M00015commission on prison education comprised of nine members who shall study
2011S06702 M00016and develop a plan for improving education in the state prison system.
2011S06702 M00017The commission shall consider and investigate the following factors when
2011S06702 M00018determining education improvements: the impact on inmate's employment
2011S06702 M00019opportunities upon release from prison, the impact on an inmate's rein-
2011S06702 M00020tegration into society and the effectiveness in reducing recidivism.
2011S06702 M00021
2011S06702 M00022Appointments to the task force shall be made as follows: three by the
2011S06702 M00023governor; two by the speaker of the assembly; one by the minority leader
2011S06702 M00024of the assembly; two by the temporary president of the senate and one by
2011S06702 M00025the minority leader of the senate.
2011S06702 M00026
2011S06702 M00027The commission shall issue a report within ten months after the effec-
2011S06702 M00028tive date of this paragraph.
2011S06702 M00029
2011S06702 M00030Section 2 of this bill states; that this act shall take effect imme-
2011S06702 M00031diately.
2011S06702 M00032
2011S06702 M00033JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06702 M00034Rehabilitation of inmate's at prisons is more then simple punishment; it
2011S06702 M00035should involve a strong education curriculum to ensure that rehabili-
2011S06702 M00036tated inmates don't resort to crime when they are released.  Released
2011S06702 M00037inmates often have difficulty finding jobs as convicted felons. The lack
2011S06702 M00038of quality education in prisons helps contribute to the recidivism of
2011S06702 M00039some inmates. This commission is charged with defining the skills that
2011S06702 M00040will help inmates return to society as a more productive citizen.

2011S06703 M00003TITLE OF BILL:
2011S06703 M00004An act to enact the "look before you leap act of 2012" relating to the
2011S06703 M00005imposition of a 5 year moratorium on high volume hydraulic fracturing
2011S06703 M00006for the purpose of conducting an investigation of the effect of hydrau-
2011S06703 M00007lic fracturing
2011S06703 M00008
2011S06703 M00009PURPOSE:
2011S06703 M00010This bill seeks to place a 5 year moratorium upon hydraulic fracturing
2011S06703 M00011in New York State in order to learn from the fracking experiences of
2011S06703 M00012other states and particularly neighboring Pennsylvania and requires the
2011S06703 M00013state university centers at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook
2011S06703 M00014to conduct an investigation into the cumulative impacts of hydraulic
2011S06703 M00015fracturing across the country, which is necessitated by the exemptions
2011S06703 M00016granted to the oil and gas industry from major federal environmental
2011S06703 M00017laws that protect our air, lands and water.
2011S06703 M00018
2011S06703 M00019SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06703 M00020Establishes a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing for the extraction of
2011S06703 M00021natural gas or oil for a 5 year period during which time the university
2011S06703 M00022research centers in New York State shall conduct an investigation into
2011S06703 M00023the cumulative impacts of this relatively new and rapidly expanding
2011S06703 M00024technology.
2011S06703 M00025
2011S06703 M00026JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06703 M00027The relatively new drilling method known as high-volume hydraulic frac-
2011S06703 M00028turing or fracking carries significant environmental risks. Among the
2011S06703 M00029adverse environmental impacts associated the fracking such as heavy
2011S06703 M00030truck traffic, road building and site clearing, the process itself
2011S06703 M00031involves drilling into the earth and pumping millions of gallons of
2011S06703 M00032water under high pressure into the ground that is mixed with sand and
2011S06703 M00033laced with industrial chemicals which the industry is not legally bound
2011S06703 M00034to disclose. The poisonous fluid fractures the shale and releases
2011S06703 M00035natural gas deposits for collection. In addition to the chemically laden
2011S06703 M00036water pumped into the drill site, highly corrosive salts, carcinogens
2011S06703 M00037like benzene and radioactive elements like radium all can occur
2011S06703 M00038naturally thousands of feet underground and combine with the fracking
2011S06703 M00039fluids to create millions of gallons of highly salinated toxic wastewa-
2011S06703 M00040ter.
2011S06703 M00041
2011S06703 M00042Thousands of internal documents recently obtained by the New York Times
2011S06703 M00043from the Environmental Protection Agency reveal that wastewater, which
2011S06703 M00044is sometimes hauled to sewage plants not designed to treat it, is then
2011S06703 M00045discharged into rivers that supply drinking water, containing radio-
2011S06703 M00046activity at levels higher than previously known, and far higher than the
2011S06703 M00047level that federal regulators say is safe for the treatment plants to
2011S06703 M00048handle. The NYT reports that pressure and influence from the gas indus-
2011S06703 M00049try and lawmakers from states that support hydro-fracking have effec-
2011S06703 M00050tively pressured the federal government to allow the industry unfettered
2011S06703 M00051growth. Despite alarming accounts reported in the media from gas produc-
2011S06703 M00052
2011S06703 M00053ing states across the country, the EPA has not intervened, in large part
2011S06703 M00054because of the industry's exemptions and exclusions from federal envi-
2011S06703 M00055ronmental protection laws.
2011S06703 M00056
2011S06703 M00057Next door in Pennsylvania there has been a doubling of active wells from
2011S06703 M0005836,000 in 2000 to 71,000 in 2010. Governor Tom Corbett has been quoted
2011S06703 M00059as saying Pennsylvania will become the next Texas of the gas industry.
2011S06703 M00060He has recently given new powers to the Secretary of Community and
2011S06703 M00061Economic Development that give authority to override Environmental
2011S06703 M00062Protection and other agencies if he thinks they are slowing Marcellus
2011S06703 M00063expansion, despite over 1400 violations of environmental law that DEP
2011S06703 M00064cited against gas drillers just last year.  The NYT further reports that
2011S06703 M00065federal and state regulators around the country are allowing most sewage
2011S06703 M00066treatment plants that accept drilling waste not to lest for radioactivi-
2011S06703 M00067ty. However, most drinking water intake plants downstream from sewage
2011S06703 M00068treatment plants in Pennsylvania that accept hydrofracking wastewater
2011S06703 M00069have not tested for radioactivity since before 2006, even though the
2011S06703 M00070drilling boom began in 2008.
2011S06703 M00071
2011S06703 M00072Drillers in Pennsylvania trucked at least half of the wastewater to
2011S06703 M00073public sewage treatment plants in 2008 and 2009 according to state offi-
2011S06703 M00074cials but some of it has been sent to other states, including New York.
2011S06703 M00075
2011S06703 M00076Despite the much anticipated EPA study concerning the impacts of hydro-
2011S06703 M00077fracking on drinking water due out this year, recent reports by the NYT
2011S06703 M00078suggest the scope of the study is being narrowed through gas industry
2011S06703 M00079influence. New York State must continue to be vigilant where questions
2011S06703 M00080of water quality and public health are concerned and must have all
2011S06703 M00081available information before allowing a questionable practice such as
2011S06703 M00082hydraulic fracturing to take place without fully knowing the potential
2011S06703 M00083dangers. This legislation places a 5 year moratorium on hydrofracking in
2011S06703 M00084New York State in order to benefit from the fracking experiences of
2011S06703 M00085other states and to make an independent and reasoned evaluation of the
2011S06703 M00086potential benefits and adverse impacts associated with this rapidly
2011S06703 M00087expanding technology.

2011S06704 M00027When the property tax cap was passed in 2011, the state excluded school
2011S06704 M00028bonding for capital projects. Recently, it has come to our attention
2011S06704 M00029that bonding for BOCES capital projects which also comes under local
2011S06704 M00030school district budgets was not excluded. This legislation will correct
2011S06704 M00031the overnight, and exclude bonding for BOCES capital projects.

2011S06705 M00014expires December 31, 2012, or, if crossbow authorization is extended,
2011S06705 M00015the bill would expire on January 1, 2014, when last year's bill
2011S06705 M00016(S.1683A) authorizing the use of rifles for hunting big game expires.
2011S06705 M00017
2011S06705 M00018EXISTING LAW:
2011S06705 M00019Cortland County was left out of legislation permitting the use of cross-
2011S06705 M00020bows for big game hunting.
2011S06705 M00021
2011S06705 M00022JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06705 M00023While crossbow hunting was extended on an experimental basis in 2011 for
2011S06705 M00024the 2011 and 2012 big game seasons, Cortland County was not included.
2011S06705 M00025
2011S06705 M00026Both sportsmen and the Cortland County Legislature have requested that
2011S06705 M00027the use of crossbows be included in the list of permissible weapons with
2011S06705 M00028which to hunt big game so that Cortland County conforms to other coun-
2011S06705 M00029ties where the use of crossbows is permitted.

2011S06706 M00007
2011S06706 M00008PURPOSE:
2011S06706 M00009To eliminate fraudulent and unnecessary medical treatment in the
2011S06706 M00010no-fault system.
2011S06706 M00011
2011S06706 M00012SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06706 M00013Section 1 of this bill would require the establishment of treatment
2011S06706 M00014guidelines for medical treatment provided under the no-fault system.
2011S06706 M00015
2011S06706 M00016Section 2 of this bill would provide an expedited process for the resol-
2011S06706 M00017ution of disputes regarding deviations from the treatment guidelines.
2011S06706 M00018
2011S06706 M00019Section 3 of the bill is the effective date.
2011S06706 M00020
2011S06706 M00021JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06706 M00022On February 29, 2012, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney announced the indict-
2011S06706 M00023ment of 36 people for participating in a $279 million no-fault fraud
2011S06706 M00024scheme involving fraudulent medical clinics (medical mills). One of the
2011S06706 M00025reasons why medical mills proliferate in New York is because New York's
2011S06706 M00026no-fault system makes it very easy to bill insurance companies for frau-
2011S06706 M00027dulent and unnecessary treatment.  This bill would remedy this situation
2011S06706 M00028by establishing guidelines for the treatment of various injuries common-
2011S06706 M00029ly sustained in automobile accidents.
2011S06706 M00030
2011S06706 M00031Treatment guidelines have been adopted in New Jersey for its no-fault
2011S06706 M00032system and in New York for the workers compensation system.  Treatment
2011S06706 M00033guidelines are a valuable tool in preventing the fraudulent over utili-
2011S06706 M00034zation of unnecessary medical treatments. Treatment guidelines are
2011S06706 M00035evidence based standards of care and best practices for the medical
2011S06706 M00036treatment of injuries which ensure that claimants receive the highest
2011S06706 M00037quality medical treatment. In the workers compensation context, the
2011S06706 M00038guidelines were initially developed by the Governor's Workers' Compen-
2011S06706 M00039sation Reform Task Force and its advisory committee comprised of well
2011S06706 M00040credentialed medical professionals and other interested parties. This
2011S06706 M00041bill would require similar scientifically based guidelines to be devel-
2011S06706 M00042oped for the treatment of injuries commonly resulting from auto acci-
2011S06706 M00043dents. These guidelines would ensure that auto accident victims would
2011S06706 M00044receive the best care for their injuries and, because the guidelines set
2011S06706 M00045forth clear standards for treatment, they would significantly reduce
2011S06706 M00046fraud and abuse in the no-fault system. Establishing treatment guide-
2011S06706 M00047lines would go a long way toward putting an end to medical mills in New
2011S06706 M00048York State.
2011S06706 M00049
2011S06706 M00050New York's no fault system is plagued by fraud and abuse which is adding
2011S06706 M00051significant costs to auto premiums in New York and a major contributing
2011S06706 M00052
2011S06706 M00053factor making New Yorkers pay among the highest auto insurance premiums
2011S06706 M00054in the nation. In fact, a recent Insurance Research Council study found
2011S06706 M00055that in the New York City area, about one in every five no-fault auto
2011S06706 M00056insurance claims closed in 2010 appear to have elements of fraud. In
2011S06706 M00057addition, New York's no-fault claim costs have far outpaced that of
2011S06706 M00058other no-fault states and the overall cost of medical care. From 2004
2011S06706 M00059through the 2nd Quarter of 2010, the average PIP claim cost rose 60.4
2011S06706 M00060percent in New York, nearly 42 points faster than the 18.6 percent
2011S06706 M00061growth rate in the Consumer Price Index cost of medical goods and
2011S06706 M00062services found in the region.  The cost of no-fault personal injury
2011S06706 M00063protection (PIP) coverage has also soared. New York's average no-fault
2011S06706 M00064PIP claim cost $9,007 is the third highest in the nation as of 2nd quar-
2011S06706 M00065ter 2010 Establishing treatment guidelines for the no-fault system would
2011S06706 M00066assist in reducing fraud in the no-fault system and the costs associated

2011S06707 M00010
2011S06707 M00011SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
2011S06707 M00012Section 1 of this bill would make burden of proof requirements in
2011S06707 M00013no-fault disputes more equitable by requiring a medical provider to
2011S06707 M00014submit more than just a claim form to establish a prima facie case.
2011S06707 M00015
2011S06707 M00016Section 2 of the bill is the effective date,
2011S06707 M00017
2011S06707 M00018JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06707 M00019On February 29. 2012, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney announced the indict-
2011S06707 M00020ment of 36 people for participating in a $279 million no-fault fraud
2011S06707 M00021scheme. Inequities in the current burden of proof requirements for no
2011S06707 M00022fault cases are one of the reasons why no-fault fraud organized crime
2011S06707 M00023schemes such as this are able to operate and increase auto insurance
2011S06707 M00024costs for New York consumers.
2011S06707 M00025
2011S06707 M00026Our civil legal system generally places the burden on the plaintiff to
2011S06707 M00027prove the basic elements of their case in order to prevail. Over the
2011S06707 M00028years, however, in the no-fault context, case law in New York has shift-
2011S06707 M00029ed that burden of proof entirely to the insurer to the point where a
2011S06707 M00030medical provider (as an "assignee" under an "assignment of benefits")
2011S06707 M00031needs only to provide a bill to establish a claim for benefits. The
2011S06707 M00032burden is on the insurer to request information to "verify" that the
2011S06707 M00033services billed for are medically necessary and in accordance with the
2011S06707 M00034no-fault law. Frequently, a lengthy exchange of paperwork ensues. This
2011S06707 M00035off-kilter burden of proof requirement has made it easy for medical
2011S06707 M00036mills and no-fault fraud crime rings to flood insurers with bogus
2011S06707 M00037lawsuits in order to make it cost prohibitive for insurers to defend
2011S06707 M00038these numerous lawsuits and force the insurers to settle and pay non-
2011S06707 M00039meritorious claims,
2011S06707 M00040
2011S06707 M00041No other state which has a no-fault system has burden of proof require-
2011S06707 M00042ments such as currently exist in New York Every other jurisdiction
2011S06707 M00043requires the medical provider bringing the lawsuit to establish that the
2011S06707 M00044service was medically necessary. causally related to the motor vehicle
2011S06707 M00045accident and properly billed. New York case law in this regard is
2011S06707 M00046completely anomalous to the authority in every other no-fault jurisdic-
2011S06707 M00047tion, This difference in New York is one of the reasons why New York is
2011S06707 M00048so attractive to fraud rings who want to bilk the system and steal from
2011S06707 M00049honest New York drivers. This bill would make burden of proof require-
2011S06707 M00050ments in the no-fault context more equitable and more in line with other
2011S06707 M00051states by requiring the medical provider to present information that the
2011S06707 M00052
2011S06707 M00053services billed are medically necessary and billed in accordance with
2011S06707 M00054the applicable fee schedule.

2011S06708 M00016JUSTIFICATION:
2011S06708 M00017On February 29, 2012, the Manhattan U.S.Attorney announced the indict-
2011S06708 M00018ment of 36 people for participating in a $279 million no-fault fraud
2011S06708 M00019scheme. One of the methods medical mills and no-fault fraud crime rings
2011S06708 M00020use in their no-fault schemes is flooding insurers with numerous
2011S06708 M00021lawsuits in order to make it difficult for insurers to defend these
2011S06708 M00022numerous lawsuits and force the insurers to settle and pay non-meritori-
2011S06708 M00023ous claims. In fact, no-fault fraud enterprises will often file a sepa-
2011S06708 M00024rate lawsuit for each bill for each treatment provided to an injured
2011S06708 M00025person. These lawsuits are often quite small in amount and have resulted
2011S06708 M00026in the New York City courts being flooded with suits The court system is
2011S06708 M00027not equipped to handle the caseload resulting from this practice.
2011S06708 M00028
2011S06708 M00029It currently takes between eighteen and thirty-six months to adjudicate
2011S06708 M00030a no-fault case. Obviously, this protracted delay was not contemplated
2011S06708 M00031by the legislature when they originally enacted the no-fault system
2011S06708 M00032which was intended to ensure prompt payment for medical costs resulting
2011S06708 M00033from auto accidents. Mandating arbitration for no-fault claims would
2011S06708 M00034provide for the expeditious and streamlined resolution of no-fault
2011S06708 M00035disputes and would reduce the excessive litigation which is currently
2011S06708 M00036clogging courts in New York City.  Unlike the court system, it currently
2011S06708 M00037takes only four to six months for a no-fault dispute to be handled
2011S06708 M00038through arbitration. It should also be noted that the arbitrators handl-
2011S06708 M00039ing no-fault cases handle these cases regularly and have expertise in
2011S06708 M00040issues relating to no-fault disputes. This expertise allows for more the
2011S06708 M00041more equitable and expeditious handling of no-fault disputes. Mandating
2011S06708 M00042arbitration would also greatly reduce litigation expenses for insurers
2011S06708 M00043and would significantly reduce costs in the no-fault system.

2011S06708 M00056growth rate in the Consumer Price Index cost of medical goods and
2011S06708 M00057services found in the region.  The cost of no-fault personal injury
2011S06708 M00058protection (PIP) coverage has also soared. New York's average no-fault
2011S06708 M00059PIP claim cost $9,007 is the third highest in the nation as of 2nd quar-
2011S06708 M00060ter 2010. Mandating arbitration of no- fault disputes would help to
2011S06708 M00061reduce lawsuit abuse by no-fault fraud rings and would assist in reduc-
2011S06708 M00062ing fraud in the no-fault system and the costs associated with fraud.

2011S06709 M00024EXISTING LAW:
2011S06709 M00025
2011S06709 M00026ABCL § 97-a empowers the SLA to issue temporary permits to applicants
2011S06709 M00027who buy a retail business that is currently licensed to operate while
2011S06709 M00028such application is pending. Chapter 396 of the Laws of 2010 further
2011S06709 M00029authorized the SLA, for one year, to issue temporary permits to certain
2011S06709 M00030other retail applicants for locations that are not currently licensed.
2011S06709 M00031This authority was extended for an additional year by Chapter 442 of the
2011S06709 M00032Laws of 2011 until October, 2012.

2011S06709 M00043to issue temporary retail permits to applicants outside of New York City
2011S06709 M00044who would otherwise be ineligible for such permits.  With these permits,
2011S06709 M00045new business owners can open their retail businesses while they await a
2011S06709 M00046full review of their applications and issuance of their licenses.  This
2011S06709 M00047benefits entrepreneurs who must make mortgage or rental payments on

2011S06709 M00049tions. The SLA retains its power to summarily suspend or cancel the
