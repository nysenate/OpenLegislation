       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.  I think we're good to

       2      go.  We're just about on time.

       3             I thank you all for coming out.

       4             We have a great panel here.

       5             I'm not going to belabor the length of time

       6      that we have here this evening by taking it up by

       7      going through introductions.

       8             We'll get to that with each panel that we get

       9      through.

      10             We've got it separated into different

      11      subject-matter areas, to hear from each group

      12      individually.  And if the groups can kind coordinate

      13      amongst yourselves as we're talking here, and then

      14      we want to make sure we have some time to have some

      15      questions and answers with the audience, and some

      16      discussion with the audience, of issues that come

      17      up.

      18             Obviously, the issue of heroin and opioid

      19      addiction is something that's significant, it's very

      20      real, and it's hitting us here locally in our

      21      communities here, but across the state.

      22             We have from the Legislature here with us who

      23      I will introduce is:

      24             Senator Funke, Rich Funke, from the Rochester

      25      area, second to my right;







                                                                   6
       1             Senator George Amedore from the Schenectady

       2      region of New York;

       3             Senator Terrence Murphy from Westchester;

       4             Senator Rob Ortt from Niagara;

       5             And we have Assemblyman Phil Palmesano, who

       6      represents us here in Yates, and Steuben, Seneca,

       7      and Schuyler counties.

       8             So, you know, in the interest of time, we're

       9      going to keep it short on introductions.

      10             As I said, these are critically important

      11      issues that we're dealing with.  We want to make

      12      sure we get input from a variety of factors.

      13             We know other communities across the state

      14      and across the country are grappling with this

      15      crisis of heroin.

      16             We've seen all too many tragedies in our

      17      hometowns, and read about it in the news all the

      18      time.  It seems to be getting worse and worse.

      19             And there are issues that we need to address,

      20      and do a better job of, from prevention, to

      21      treatment, to law enforcement and the crime aspects

      22      of this as well.

      23             But it's got to be a community-wide-based

      24      approach from our local leaders, local community

      25      organizations, our local governments, our school







                                                                   7
       1      districts, law enforcement and district attorneys

       2      that are here, the court system, right up to our

       3      state government and our federal government, because

       4      this is a nationwide crisis that we are dealing

       5      with.

       6             So, I thank you all for showing your interest

       7      and coming out here to, hopefully, be able to share

       8      some of your experiences with you -- with us, and to

       9      learn some things about what we're doing, because

      10      we're here to learn ideas on how and what we should

      11      be doing in Albany, moving forward.

      12             We have -- we're in the budget process right

      13      now in Albany.

      14             And in the budget proposal that's out there

      15      now, I think it's about $140 million that's proposed

      16      in the budget for "heroin and opioid addiction"

      17      categories.  But that's only about a $6 million

      18      increase from last year's budget in that, and we're

      19      looking at ways how we can further bolster our

      20      community services to provide for treatment and

      21      prevention of these -- these -- this real

      22      public-health issue that we have and the individuals

      23      that are addicted.

      24             And we recognize it as a public-health issue,

      25      as well as a crime issue, and it needs to be







                                                                   8
       1      approached on all of those levels for us to be

       2      effective and everyone to be involved.

       3             So, I thank you again for coming out.

       4             We're going to start out with the --

       5             Do you guys want to do any opening remarks?

       6             SENATOR MURPHY:  No, just go right to it.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.  We are going to start

       8      with our first panel, which is a group of district

       9      attorneys and sheriffs, law enforcement, from

      10      Yates County here, from Schuyler County, and

      11      Chemung County.

      12             We have Joe Fazzary, the Schuyler County

      13      District Attorney;

      14             Ron Spike, the Yates County Sheriff;

      15             Bill Yessman, the Schuyler County Sheriff;

      16             Jason Cook, Assistant DA.  Former DA here in

      17      Yates County.  He's an assistant in Chemung County

      18      now, representing the Chemung County DA's Office;

      19             Investigator Thomas Dunham from the Penn Yan

      20      Village Police Department;

      21             And our Yates County District Attorney here

      22      with us, Valerie Gardner.

      23             I thank you all for being with us here today.

      24             I don't know if, Valerie, you would like to

      25      start it out on being the hometown DA here?







                                                                   9
       1             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  Sure, I'd love to.

       2             Thank you very much.

       3             Senators, Assemblyman, all of our guests

       4      here, but, particularly our community members here

       5      in Yates County who are facing a terrible situation

       6      with the heroin epidemic that is sweeping across our

       7      county, I want to welcome you especially, and say,

       8      thank you for taking time out to come out tonight.

       9             So, thank you very, very much.

      10                  [Applause.]

      11             So in terms of -- we all, I think, are

      12      familiar with the national statistics and the

      13      statewide statistics that are shocking.

      14             This epidemic has taken us, literally, by

      15      storm.

      16             And we're doing the best we can here in

      17      Yates County to try and combat that, and address the

      18      significant issues with opiate addiction, and,

      19      specifically, the influx of heroin that we've had

      20      here in Yates County.

      21             And my request tonight to our State

      22      Legislators here is that, please, we are a small

      23      county.  We need your help in committing the

      24      financial resources for us to address this problem.

      25             It is widespread.







                                                                   10
       1             And one thing about heroin addiction is

       2      that -- or any addiction, but, specifically, heroin

       3      addiction, as it plays out here, it does not know

       4      our county boundary, and so as a result, we have

       5      individuals here who are using, who are addicted,

       6      they're traveling outside of Yates County for their

       7      supply of heroin.  And our law enforcement agencies

       8      have jurisdictions that they have to abide by.

       9             So I would ask the State to please commit

      10      significant resources to the New York State Police,

      11      to interagency cooperation, so that we can address

      12      this problem beyond the boundaries that impact us so

      13      greatly here locally, please.

      14             In addition, I think we all can appreciate

      15      that by the time an addict gets to us, we're at the

      16      end of the pipeline here, and there's already been

      17      significant harm, not only to the addict and their

      18      families, but also victims involved in crime.

      19             And, so, when we look at this, I think that

      20      we really have to appreciate that every strategy to

      21      attack this problem must be employed, and the most

      22      important is prevention, education, to keep people

      23      out of the criminal justice system, and that

      24      benefits all of us.

      25             But in order for that to happen, we must have







                                                                   11
       1      treatment available, so that the option, when an

       2      addict decides that they want to get help, that they

       3      have the ability to seek treatment.

       4             Currently, you have some choices before you

       5      in terms of dealing with the insurance industry and

       6      the historic regulations that the insurance

       7      companies are allowed to force addicts to fail, two,

       8      three times, before they have access to inpatient

       9      treatment.

      10             So I would ask that the Legislature insist

      11      that the insurance companies take notice that heroin

      12      is unlike other addictions; that outpatient

      13      treatment is just not as effective as significant

      14      inpatient treatment, and make those resources

      15      available.

      16                  [Applause.]

      17             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  I know that the

      18      proposed budget includes approximately 30 beds to be

      19      located in the upstate area.

      20             And I would just say that, while it is a

      21      start, it is woefully insufficient.

      22             And I hope that you will all advocate

      23      strongly for more beds to be available for our

      24      citizens who are battling this addiction.

      25             And, I just would note to you that, in the







                                                                   12
       1      absence of doing that, the very serious consequence

       2      is that the beds that will end up being available

       3      for these folks are the beds in our county jail, and

       4      that is not something that we want to see.

       5             I think the Sheriff can tell you that we have

       6      had just a tremendous increase in population because

       7      of this.

       8             And so we need to remember that the

       9      consequences are widespread for all of us here.

      10             In addition, I would also ask that the

      11      alternatives to heroin that some turn to, if they

      12      happen to be on probation supervision, or in a

      13      program where they are trying to address getting

      14      well and fighting their addiction, that synthetic

      15      drugs absolutely must be addressed within our

      16      Legislature so that our penal law is not defining

      17      drugs and controlled substances that are illegal by

      18      the polymers that can so easily be changed.

      19             And so, please, if you could support that,

      20      that would be a tremendous help to law enforcement.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  And, Valerie, as we spoke

      22      about this yesterday in front of the Yates

      23      Legislature, we have passed that in prior years in

      24      the State Senate, and we have passed it this year

      25      already.







                                                                   13
       1             We'll put the pressure on our Assemblyman

       2      here, Phil Palmesano, to get that through the

       3      Assembly, which he's very supportive of, don't get

       4      me wrong.  I'm just teasing him.

       5             But our battle there, with any kind of these

       6      changes in criminal penalties, our struggle is to

       7      get it through the State Assembly.

       8             But we're there with you on that.

       9             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  Okay.  So go, Phil!

      10                  [Laughter.]

      11             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  So, lastly, I just

      12      want to give you an idea of how this has impacted us

      13      locally in Yates County for our criminal justice

      14      system.

      15             Our county court, Judge Falvey, who serves us

      16      in county court, hears felonies.  And, surprisingly,

      17      Yates County has been pretty consistent over the

      18      last 17 years, as I look back at the statistics, in

      19      terms of how many felonies get filed.

      20             We are over 20 percent higher as of last

      21      year, directly related to the heroin epidemic.

      22             And with regard -- if you can imagine, so, we

      23      had 91, either superior court informations or

      24      indictments, filed last year alone.

      25             That is a tremendous amount for Yates County,







                                                                   14
       1      and there are victims attached to every single one

       2      of those cases.

       3             And that is felonies only.

       4             If you add in the misdemeanors that are

       5      handled in local courts, the possession cases, there

       6      are -- it's just a tremendous amount of resources

       7      that we're putting into the criminal justice system

       8      instead of prevention.

       9             And, so, I'm hoping that everybody can

      10      support that effort through the Yates Substance

      11      Abuse Coalition, and however you can, in talking to

      12      your families and neighbors.

      13             With regard to our numbers, a total of

      14      98 cases over the last 2 years, the highest charge

      15      has been a drug charge.  So we're not talking --

      16      that's not the only cases that involved drug

      17      involvement.

      18             There are lots of larcenies, and other

      19      things, that the impetus for the crime is drugs.

      20             But I'm talking about the charge is a drug

      21      charge.  And out of those 98 cases, 32 are felony

      22      cases.

      23             We do have 100 percent conviction rate here

      24      in Yates County on all of those cases.

      25             And, so, we're doing what we can through the







                                                                   15
       1      programs that we have in the criminal justice

       2      system, and I hope that you'll continue your support

       3      for that.

       4             And, also, continue to ask our

       5      representatives to help with the budgetary

       6      constraints as well.

       7             So thank you very much.

       8                  [Applause.]

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      10             Thank you, District Attorney Gardner.

      11             Now I'll turn to our sheriffs.

      12             Sheriff Spike, Sheriff Yessman, if you could

      13      give us an overview of your perspective on this, and

      14      where you think we at the State, at the legislative

      15      level, may be able to offer assistance in your

      16      efforts.

      17             SHERIFF RONALD G. SPIKE:  Sure.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  And kind of the trends,

      19      obviously, that you're seeing here locally.

      20             SHERIFF RONALD G. SPIKE:  Good evening,

      21      everyone.

      22             Thank you, Senator, for having this hearing

      23      and thank you, Committee Members, for being here,

      24      and everyone else.

      25             When this community was first forming a







                                                                   16
       1      coalition, I put together some slides at the

       2      Penn Yan Academy, to speak, and I said at the time

       3      that heroin and opiate abuse was an epidemic.

       4             And I stand by that label today, that's what

       5      it is.

       6             And I never thought at the time, a few years

       7      ago, I'd be standing in a school in this community

       8      and talking about heroin.  It just wasn't something

       9      we talked about.

      10             So it's been quite a challenge for public

      11      safety, public health, for the criminal justice

      12      system, public education, and all the treatment

      13      entities that are around.

      14             We've had a dozen deaths over the last few

      15      years, ten from heroin, one from pills, and one from

      16      an addict who was so needing, they chewed on a

      17      fentanyl patch, and killed themselves.

      18             The oldest was a 45-year-old woman who

      19      started out taking Oxycontin, and then went to

      20      heroin because it was available and affordable.

      21             Sadly, we also had the life of a 17-year-old

      22      girl who once tried it for fun and was soon

      23      addicted.

      24             For this county, perhaps to some, a dozen

      25      deaths may not seem high.  But in this close







                                                                   17
       1      community, it is huge to us.  It is huge.

       2             And it's just a terrible problem because, in

       3      some areas of this country, the deaths by heroin are

       4      exceeding the deaths by car crashes, which normally

       5      is the number-one killer of our young people.

       6             I and members of my office have interacted

       7      with families and those addicted and those who have

       8      overdosed.

       9             On the majority of those cases of overdoses,

      10      the Good Samaritan laws have been around; and, thus,

      11      we don't get to get into the criminal justice

      12      systems or make an arrest because of that.  They

      13      seem to apply more often than not.

      14             But, we have dealt with many moms and dads

      15      who don't know what to do.  They're kind of behind

      16      closed doors in some way, and perplexed, on seeing

      17      their son or their daughter transform into an

      18      addict.

      19             And it is -- it's just terrible, because even

      20      those that find treatment have to travel 50 miles to

      21      get that treatment.  And so that, in itself, is yet

      22      another problem.

      23             Those that are abusing it just cannot help

      24      themselves.  It is such a powerful drug, such a

      25      powerful craving, it cares less whether you're young







                                                                   18
       1      or old, rich or poor, it matters not to that.

       2             Many in their 20s are stealing from their

       3      parents, they're stealing from their grandparents,

       4      or they go to their neighbor's house and steal

       5      property, shoplift, forge checks, that type of

       6      thing.

       7             Our investigators have spent considerable

       8      time in the city of Rochester at pawn shops where

       9      individuals take this property to get the cash to

      10      buy the drugs.

      11             All drug-possession cases in the last 4 years

      12      have risen 120 percent for our agency, and felony

      13      drug cases for our agency in the last 4 years have

      14      risen 150 percent.

      15             We have no dedicated drug unit in this

      16      county, and the majority of the County's

      17      investigators' time involves drug investigations.

      18             I recently deputized the local Penn Yan

      19      police investigator, who is here at this table, who

      20      works very hard in this area.

      21             As we all work together very much, I wanted

      22      him covered, because he was outside of his

      23      jurisdiction and spending a lot of time in the

      24      county with our people, working on cases related to

      25      the village of Penn Yan.







                                                                   19
       1             I said to him, I said, "Tom, how much time

       2      are you spending on drugs?"

       3             80 percent of his time.

       4             One year ago, after four months of

       5      investigation, we were able to take down -- with the

       6      Penn Yan police and our agency, took down a guy who

       7      was selling drugs in Dundee, and then moved to

       8      Penn Yan.  He was selling heroin, cocaine,

       9      oxycodone, and Suboxone.

      10             He ended up getting 12 years in prison.

      11             Once again, the time involved with these

      12      cases is huge.  To make these drug arrests, to be

      13      involved with informants and doing surveillance is

      14      huge.

      15             Another statistic that I think is very

      16      relevant for everyone to understand, I looked at our

      17      statistics in the last five years for making arrests

      18      for driving while impaired by use of drugs.

      19             Driving when under the influence of drugs, in

      20      the last five years they've increased by 300 percent

      21      in this county.

      22             And we have put up billboards.

      23             We have trained a deputy as a

      24      drug-recognition expert.  They call him a "DRE."

      25             There's only about 220 of them in the whole







                                                                   20
       1      state of New York, and they're very important.

       2             And he's a big asset to local police deputies

       3      and the troopers.

       4             In 2011 I found myself on the national news

       5      when we had a tragic fatal traffic accident on a

       6      county road, where we had several Amish were killed

       7      in a van, because of a driver who was under the

       8      influence of cocaine, who struck them, and took all

       9      their lives.  Convicted of homicide.

      10             The men and women who perform public safety

      11      in Yates County, whether they be county or the local

      12      police, don't get enough recognition for all the

      13      good work that they are doing.

      14             And we have really been touched by this

      15      epidemic.

      16             Our 911 communications center deals with

      17      overdose cases, it ties up a dispatcher doing

      18      pre-arrival instructions when they're sending EMS,

      19      and what have you.

      20             Our patrol deputies have to respond to these

      21      increased calls of stolen property.  And, they've

      22      all been trained in the use of Narcan, in every

      23      patrol car, and have saved some lives.

      24             We have put receptacles in our public safety

      25      building and other satellite offices, where people







                                                                   21
       1      can bring in drugs and drop them off, no longer

       2      being used.

       3             And, we have put up a crime-tip hotline.

       4             And I'm trying to get an app on a smartphone,

       5      and I'm very close to having that done.

       6             Our K-9 units have increased calls for

       7      searches of property to detect drugs.

       8             We had to get a special license from

       9      New York State, and now I'm working on a license

      10      from the DEA, to actually hold the drugs in our

      11      possession so the drug dogs can be trained on

      12      finding those drugs.

      13             So I'm working -- we're working on that right

      14      now.

      15             Our youth officer is assigned to the Dundee

      16      school, and is involved with D.A.R.E. (drug-abuse

      17      resistant education) for fifth graders.

      18             And don't I wish I had the resources to

      19      continue to do that in the eighth grade, and, again,

      20      in eleventh grade, because it's through repetition,

      21      I feel, that we can optimize our education efforts

      22      of our kids.

      23             So I thank the Yates County schools for all

      24      they are doing and have done for public-health

      25      education.







                                                                   22
       1             Our criminal investigators are handling

       2      informants, doing surveillance, handling evidence.

       3      And with handling evidence, we are very aware of the

       4      fentanyl issue.

       5             These dealers are cutting heroin with

       6      fentanyl.  And in some cases, recently, up in the

       7      Erie County area, they had 23 deaths in 11 days

       8      where it was pure fentanyl.

       9             They're seeing this down in the Binghamton

      10      area, and also other areas of the state.

      11             And so we're constantly doing training on

      12      safety, so that when we're handling this drug

      13      evidence, we don't get hurt ourselves.

      14             The other thing we're seeing more of, which

      15      I think is important for you to know, is we're

      16      seeing more synthetic marijuana starting to appear

      17      on the scene.

      18             So I think that's important.

      19             Last, but not least, is our county jail.

      20             We have several addicts in our jail on a

      21      regular basis.

      22             We've seen withdrawal.

      23             We have seen infections due to needle use.

      24             In the last year we had more inmates

      25      hospitalized than ever before, and a lot of that was







                                                                   23
       1      due to drugs, and we often have to guard them at our

       2      local hospital.

       3             Right now, I've got officers guarding an

       4      individual, who was in our jail for drugs, up at the

       5      local hospital.  And we have to do that 24/7.

       6             We've had to do guard duty at

       7      Strong Memorial Hospital, travel up there and back

       8      with guards, to guard these individuals at the

       9      hospital.

      10             It puts a strain on jail resources and

      11      overtime.

      12             We have FLACRA coming into our jail on a

      13      regular basis for substance-abuse and alcohol

      14      counseling.

      15             And we are seeing a lot of attempts to

      16      smuggle contraband into the jail through visitation

      17      and other methods, especially Suboxone which comes

      18      in the strips.  We're seeing more and more of that.

      19             We even had a drug-court participant, who

      20      knew she was going to get sanctioned in drug court

      21      by the judge and put in jail, hide heroin inside her

      22      body.  And then we caught her snorting heroin in her

      23      jail cell.

      24             And that type of thing.

      25             So we continue to see increases in the number







                                                                   24
       1      of females that are involved in drugs, kind of

       2      disproportionate to those of the males, especially

       3      in our jail.

       4             And so I think it's important to know that we

       5      had as many as 21 females in our jail last August.

       6             I only have four cells in my jail for

       7      females.

       8             Okay?

       9             We had 21 in jail.

      10             And a few weeks ago we had an inmate give

      11      birth, and she now has her baby in her jail cell in

      12      my jail.  And we've had to -- had to provide a

      13      nursery, and providing that whole setting, keeping

      14      her separated and that child separated, because,

      15      under the law, she has a right to have that baby

      16      with her in the jail, and she wants it, keeping that

      17      separated from everybody else that's in that jail

      18      and the people that she shouldn't be around, has

      19      been very challenging for us.

      20             So, finally, our jail medical staff and our

      21      jail physician, we are commencing a plan for a

      22      program to introduce a drug in our jail called

      23      "Vivitrol" for addicts who want to recover and who

      24      will go to counseling.

      25             We need to rethink alcohol and opiate







                                                                   25
       1      dependence for those in the criminal justice system.

       2             Vivitrol is FDA-approved.  It's

       3      non-addictive.  And contrary to other drug

       4      treatments, it is an opioid-blocker and an

       5      antagonist, and a single shot will last 28 days.

       6             It appears to me that Vivitrol, together with

       7      counseling, for six months, may be the best chance

       8      for detoxification and reduced relapses.

       9             Relapses have taken many of our local addicts

      10      to their death, and rehospitalization.

      11             Let me conclude and say this:

      12             Law enforcement will continue to do our part

      13      as best we can with the manpower and resources we

      14      have.

      15             I've been asked, Could we do more?

      16             The answer is, yes, I could do more with

      17      added resources, but those appear to be limited.

      18             County budgets are already strained to stay

      19      under the tax cap.

      20             I have looked for grant opportunities, and

      21      those available at this time do not address drug

      22      investigation or interdiction.

      23             So grants, similar to the federal Byrne

      24      grants of yesteryear, would be something that would

      25      be very accepted so that we could have our own







                                                                   26
       1      dedicated drug unit.

       2             Working with the Village police, and

       3      together, we will make an impact.

       4             Law enforcement has a very important role to

       5      play in this multi-faceted community crime and

       6      health problem.

       7             The sellers of heroin belong in jail.

       8             Those addicted do not belong in jail.  They

       9      need affordable treatment.

      10             I want to thank our local county

      11      substance-abuse coalition for all their volunteers

      12      and all their advocacy and the partnership of

      13      education and awareness efforts.

      14             I thank this Committee for allowing me to

      15      make a few remarks, and thank you for coming to

      16      Penn Yan.

      17                  [Applause.]

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Sheriff Spike.

      19             Sheriff Yessman, from Schuyler County, do you

      20      have any comments to add?

      21             SHERIFF WILLIAM E. YESSMAN, JR.:  Yes, thank

      22      you.

      23             And thank you for coming out tonight.

      24             I'd like to say that Schuyler County is

      25      different from Yates County.







                                                                   27
       1             We're very similar in size.  We're also very

       2      similar in the problems we're seeing.

       3             We've had this conversation with

       4      Sheriff Spike in the past.

       5             We're trying to share information now, but,

       6      we just don't have the resources, being small

       7      counties, small agencies, to dedicate full-time drug

       8      investigators to this issue.

       9             In over 30 years with the Sheriff's Office,

      10      I've never seen a drug come in and take hold of the

      11      community like heroin has.

      12             We've seen cocaine come in.

      13             We've seen the marijuana.

      14             We're still dealing with methamphetamine in

      15      Schuyler County.

      16             But heroin is taking hold in the younger

      17      population in our counties, it's destroying them.

      18             We have made a couple of saves with Narcan,

      19      only to arrest the people the next day for

      20      possession again, because they need this drug.

      21             The jail situation, I do not have any female

      22      cells in Schuyler County.  We're the second-smallest

      23      jail in the state.

      24             I currently have six females boarded out to

      25      Chemung County, all on drug-related charges, every







                                                                   28
       1      one of them.  Some of them for larcenies, because

       2      they had to steal to get money to get the drugs, but

       3      they're all in on drug-related offenses.

       4             And that's an expense that we're not prepared

       5      for, and it just keeps getting worse and worse.

       6             When Sheriff Spike told me he had 21 females

       7      in jail last summer, I thought, what's going on up

       8      there?

       9             You know, we weren't seeing the heroin down

      10      in Schuyler County.  We were kind of isolated from

      11      it for a while.

      12             And we said, Geez, we're lucky.  You know,

      13      it's up in Yates County.  It's over in

      14      Tompkins County.  It's down in Chemung County.

      15             We have it.

      16             We saw a lot of our people overdosing in

      17      other counties.

      18             Now, they're overdosing at home in our

      19      county.

      20             And we have to take steps to be able to fight

      21      this.

      22             Again, counseling, prevention, is a great

      23      thing, but, right now, people come to us as the

      24      local law enforcement, as their elected

      25      law-enforcement officials in the counties, and want







                                                                   29
       1      our help.  And we're trying to do what we can.

       2             Again, my investigators work on this,

       3      basically, in their -- it used to be their spare

       4      time.  Now it's taking over their job.  They spend a

       5      majority of their time.

       6             Every morning we sit in our criminal

       7      investigations division and talk about drugs.

       8             We have known locations in our county where

       9      we're making our presence very well known in the

      10      area.  These people know we're out there.  And,

      11      we're trying to put enough pressure on them to maybe

      12      move on, but that's not solving the problem.

      13             Even if we move our dealers out, others are

      14      going to move in and take over, or, they're going to

      15      go into the surrounding area and buy their drugs

      16      there.

      17             It's not going to be any easy fix.

      18             Like the Sheriff said, this is an epidemic,

      19      and I totally agree.

      20             A year ago, I would have said, maybe not.

      21             But the way this has moved in and taken hold,

      22      it's just a terrible thing that we have to do

      23      something about.

      24             And as a law-enforcement leader, this is one

      25      of those things that our hands are tied, because,







                                                                   30
       1      again, budget-wise, there's no money there, they

       2      reduce our budgets all the time.

       3             We need some type of prolonged funding, at

       4      least have task forces, maybe between counties.  You

       5      know, we're seeing similar movement between

       6      Yates County and Schuyler-County at this time.

       7             And we're working with, the sheriff

       8      investigator from Penn Yan here, was just down in

       9      our office a couple weeks ago, working a case with

      10      us.

      11             And this is what we're going to have to do,

      12      is team together.

      13             But, agencies aren't going to -- I know the

      14      police department in Penn Yan, he's working most of

      15      the time out of the village, and they're not going

      16      to be able to financially keep that going.

      17             So we need to find a way to fund these

      18      investigations, and the investigators that are

      19      handling these investigations.

      20             Thank you.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Sheriff.

      22                  [Applause.]

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  Investigator Dunham, from

      24      your perspective as the drug investigator in

      25      Yates County, I take it, wearing many hats, and







                                                                   31
       1      I thank the Penn Yan Village Police Department for

       2      allowing you to do that.

       3             If you could give us your perspective on

       4      this.

       5             INV. THOMAS DUNHAM:  Yes.

       6             Thank you all for coming, and thank you for

       7      putting this on.

       8             And I do wear many hats, and I do spend the

       9      vast majority of my days dealing specifically with

      10      heroin.

      11             And I look out in the crowd and I see many

      12      faces that I know.  And the community plays a huge

      13      role in this, and helping combat this.

      14             But heroin has been a growing problem in the

      15      Penn Yan community over the last several years, and

      16      it's become one of the most prevalent drugs being

      17      used in our area.

      18             We've seen a dramatic increase in heroin use

      19      and overdoses, and we're dealing not only with the

      20      increased crime that comes along with that, but we

      21      see the effects it has on families, and the

      22      community as a whole.

      23             And we need to work together with other

      24      agencies, we need to work with treatment counseling

      25      and education, to help combat this.







                                                                   32
       1             And while there are several agencies and

       2      specialty services involved in treating and

       3      combating heroin on a law-enforcement level, like

       4      the other Sheriff said, and the DA said, funding is

       5      a big obstacle for us.

       6             Our officers received a grant in 2011 under a

       7      Byrne grant that the Sheriff had mentioned, to

       8      purchase surveillance equipment.

       9             This equipment has been invaluable to us.  We

      10      have used it effectively to investigate the sale of

      11      heroin and other controlled substances.

      12             However, this equipment can be -- it quickly

      13      gets outdated.  And there's new technologies

      14      available now that have reoccurring costs associated

      15      with them to help combat this.

      16             We have limited manpower.

      17             We do not have anyone currently assigned

      18      specifically to investigate the drug problem.

      19             In Penn Yan there's -- I am the investigator,

      20      so I deal with drug cases, sexual assaults, any type

      21      of crime that happens, that's me.

      22             So with the way heroin has taken off in the

      23      last few years, it's been tough, it's been busy.

      24             We're dealing -- on top of that, we're

      25      dealing with the increased availability of needles,







                                                                   33
       1      when in years past, in our community, in order to

       2      get needles, you would have to become a member a

       3      needle-exchange program, and you'd have to travel to

       4      that needle-exchange program to get needles.

       5             Now you can purchase needles at any pharmacy

       6      here in the village.  And people purchasing those

       7      needles, they're not required to carry any paperwork

       8      as to where they were purchased or sign a log

       9      indicating they purchased those needles.

      10             However, individuals purchasing

      11      pseudoephedrine are required to produce

      12      identification and they sign a log.  That's used as

      13      a tool with law enforcement to combat the

      14      methamphetamine manufacturing.

      15             On top of the greater availability of

      16      needles, law enforcement can no longer effect an

      17      arrest on individuals carrying used needles with

      18      residual amounts of heroin in the needle.

      19             And while we understand the public-health

      20      concerns, and the fear that individuals may share or

      21      reuse needles, the availability and the ease at

      22      which a person can obtain them is a concern for law

      23      enforcement.

      24             We continue to see increases of heroin, and

      25      increased crime related to its use.







                                                                   34
       1             There have been some effective steps and

       2      tools that have been taken and used, such as

       3      naloxone being issued to every officer.  Public

       4      health and the Sheriff's Office, both were great in

       5      implementing that.

       6             Naloxone is a medication that's used to

       7      reverse the effects of opiates, and it's especially

       8      used after someone overdoses.

       9             We were trained in that, our office was

      10      trained in that, in 2014, and every officer in our

      11      department was issued a naloxone kit.

      12             Since we've received that training, we have

      13      successfully used naloxone 11 times on individuals

      14      who have overdosed.  We've also been present on

      15      several other instances where EMS has used it.

      16             And while there's been some progress, and

      17      there are several agencies and groups working

      18      towards stopping this problem, we continue to see an

      19      issue in this community.

      20             And, law enforcement plays a key role in

      21      combating heroin.

      22             We're right on the front lines, dealing with

      23      this stuff every day, and we're often dealing with

      24      people when they're at their lowest point.

      25             We don't only work towards arresting people







                                                                   35
       1      and dealers and stemming the flow of heroin into the

       2      community, but we're also working on educating the

       3      public and working with the public to help tackle

       4      the issue.

       5             And, you know, I can't stress enough how

       6      important it is for the public to contact law

       7      enforcement if they see something going wrong.

       8             We're always available, and we love to have

       9      the public's input.

      10             And often law enforcement, I know it's not

      11      the only tool here, but often that's --

      12      law-enforcement intervention is the catalyst to push

      13      someone into treatment that they might not seek on

      14      their own.

      15             We continue to see major issues with it, and,

      16      on our level, I think that we need funding, tools,

      17      and appropriate legislation to combat it.

      18             And I just want to thank everyone for coming.

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Investigator.

      20                  [Applause.]

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Assistant DA Cook, can you

      22      give us a perspective from Chemung County, a little

      23      bit further south from where we've heard from.

      24             ADA JASON COOK:  Thank you, Senator O'Mara.

      25             And thank you all for coming out tonight.







                                                                   36
       1             I don't think it is an exaggeration to use

       2      the term that heroin is "a cancer" that is really

       3      plaguing all of our counties, the number of people

       4      that are dying every day in one of our -- in Yates

       5      County or Chemung County or any of these counties.

       6             And another analogy, certainly, we need all

       7      hands on deck.

       8             It's a law-enforcement problem.

       9             It's a public health problem.

      10             It's an education problem.

      11             We all have to contribute.

      12             I guess my perspective, and I'll share a

      13      couple of insights that I've had, but, certainly,

      14      prosecution is where, often, sometimes the dam

      15      breaks.

      16             A parent discovers they've been stolen from.

      17             A child gets arrested for possession of a

      18      forge instrument; forged checks.

      19             But when you hear the term "heroin," I guess

      20      the distinction that I immediately make, is there's

      21      a big distinction between:

      22             People who are addicted and who are

      23      committing crimes to feed that addiction.  Every day

      24      they get up, Where am I going to get my drugs?

      25      Where am I going to get my drugs?  Where am I going







                                                                   37
       1      to get my drugs?

       2             And those who are feeding -- those who are

       3      dealing drugs, those who are selling to those who

       4      are then becoming addicted.

       5             I think that's a major distinction that we

       6      see.

       7             And, certainly, separating those class of

       8      defendants, those who are committing larcenies and

       9      other thefts to feed their own habit, and those who

      10      are willingly selling to everybody they can sell, to

      11      make money, to profit from the suffering of

      12      everybody they're selling to, is a key distinction

      13      in the analysis.

      14             And every case is different on its own facts.

      15             But there is a reason why prison is

      16      authorized for the sale of drugs.

      17             And a practical thing that I raised with

      18      Senator O'Mara, and I'm sure he'll bring it up, is

      19      in dealing with these crimes, the lab reports that

      20      we get for heroin are -- and the statutes that

      21      govern heroin, the lab reports are typically, for a

      22      single heroin dose, are in the thousandths of

      23      percent.

      24             Like, a single heroin dose, for example,

      25      it would be in a small envelope, glassine envelope,







                                                                   38
       1      it would get sent to the lab.  It would

       2      register .025 (25/1000) of a gram.

       3             So that would land on a prosecutor's desk.

       4             Now, that is a minuscule amount,

       5      quantity-wise.

       6             Certainly can be lethal.  A single dose can

       7      be lethal.

       8             And as Sheriff Spike referenced, drug dealers

       9      often water it down, they cut it down, because they

      10      want to make more money, they want to sell to more

      11      people.  So they'll cut it down and mix it with

      12      fentanyl or some other drug component, but -- and

      13      it's typically sold in bundles.  Ten envelopes to a

      14      bundle.

      15             But the practical thing that I have raised

      16      with Senator O'Mara, is it's different from, let's

      17      say, another controlled substance like cocaine.

      18             To get to a significant felony charge, you

      19      need to get an eighth of an ounce.

      20             So doing a little bit of math, if you have a

      21      single dose that's .025 (25/1000) of a gram, and you

      22      need to get to an eighth of an ounce, which is

      23      3.5 grams, to have a significant felony charge over

      24      someone, you would have -- with a significant prison

      25      sentence --







                                                                   39
       1             In other words, you're looking at a

       2      possession of a large amount of drugs for,

       3      presumably, a dealer.  Not someone who is just using

       4      every day for their own use, but a dealer, someone

       5      who is spreading this poison here in our community.

       6             -- you would have to have so many of those,

       7      it doesn't happen very often.

       8             So what I've suggested to Senator O'Mara is

       9      really a revamping, a changing of the penal-law

      10      sections, because that's what governs what we do,

      11      the statutes, the law, pertaining to heroin, because

      12      it is so much lighter, it is so much smaller, and

      13      cut so differently than cocaine and other

      14      controlled-substance drugs, that would allow

      15      prosecutors to seek higher-grade felony charges for

      16      possession of the dealers, of the dealers that are

      17      peddling this poison and creating the addicts that

      18      is the cancer among us.

      19             So, I proposed that to Senator O'Mara, and

      20      I think he'll certainly discuss that with his

      21      colleagues.

      22             But that would be a practical -- that's a

      23      practical problem that we face in identifying the

      24      dealers.

      25             And, again, making a distinction between







                                                                   40
       1      those who are addicted, committing crimes for their

       2      own addiction, and those who are pedaling, those who

       3      are selling to those and profiting from those that

       4      are becoming addicted to that.

       5             And that's certainly a big distinction that

       6      I have seen in Chemung County and throughout all of

       7      the counties.

       8             And that's not to take away from any of the

       9      treatment component or any of the aftercare or any

      10      of the prevention.

      11             But that's simply from the prosecution

      12      perspective.

      13             And thank you again for all coming tonight.

      14                  [Applause.]

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Jason.

      16             District Attorney Fazzary.

      17             Thank you for being here, Joe.

      18             DA JOSEPH G. FAZZARY:  Thank you, Senator.

      19             I'll keep this brief, primarily because

      20      Senator O'Mara, my good friend, told me to keep it

      21      brief.

      22                  [Laughter.]

      23             DA JOSEPH G. FAZZARY:  Two years ago, I sat

      24      at a hearing just look this in Elmira, at

      25      Elmira College.  Senator O'Mara was present for







                                                                   41
       1      that.

       2             And, I heard somebody from Tioga County

       3      treatment say that they had had 10 overdose deaths

       4      in the last 6 months.

       5             And I looked at the sheriff and I said, "Not

       6      in Schuyler County.  We hadn't had any."

       7             I listened, and I thought, boy, it sounds

       8      like it may be coming our way.

       9             And as the Sheriff said, our, probably,

      10      number-one drug in Schuyler is methamphetamine.

      11             But, certainly, in the last five to six

      12      months, I have seen just how wrong I was that it was

      13      going to be a problem.

      14             Schuyler County, second-smallest -- you guys

      15      are small, we're smaller -- second-smallest county

      16      in the state of New York, we had 18 reported opioid

      17      overdoses in the last 4 months.  We had six of those

      18      people die.

      19             Okay?

      20             So, all of a sudden, this is a real problem,

      21      not just for the cities, but for places just like

      22      us.

      23             I have heard more times in the community, in

      24      the last 6 or 8 months, than I've heard in my entire

      25      24-year career in Schuyler County, "What are you







                                                                   42
       1      doing about the drugs, Mr. Fazzary?"

       2             And I said, You all think that we're doing

       3      nothing, you all may think that this table is doing

       4      nothing, because you don't necessarily see us out

       5      there.

       6             And then I educate them on how, in order to

       7      get somebody for selling drugs, you have to get

       8      somebody in.

       9             Okay?

      10             That's not easy to do, because this isn't

      11      really like the city of Elmira, where you can pull

      12      up on a street corner and hand 20 bucks out a car

      13      window to somebody that walks up to your car and

      14      gives you a bag of heroin.

      15             Not in Schuyler County, not in Yates County,

      16      we don't have them standing on the street corner.

      17             We have them in houses, in apartments.

      18             So, the neighbor comes up -- I had one in my

      19      office yesterday, from the County, County employee,

      20      she said, "There's a drug dealer right next to my

      21      house.  There's cars pulling in there all night

      22      long, all day long.  What are you people doing about

      23      it?"

      24             I said, "Well, it's the first that I've heard

      25      about it, but you live out in the country, and we







                                                                   43
       1      can't exactly put a police car in your yard.  We

       2      can't exactly put a patrol car, or even an unmarked

       3      car, on the side of the street."

       4             So what we need is for these people that get

       5      in trouble, and they want to help themselves out, we

       6      need for those people to come to us, or for our

       7      police officers to go to them and say, Would you be

       8      willing to help us out?

       9             So I want you to understand, it's not for a

      10      lack of our attention to this, because we all know

      11      it's a serious, serious problem, but, we don't

      12      always have an in.

      13             And sometimes when we do have an in, we have

      14      to wait six or eight months to make it, so that when

      15      the person does get arrested, and I know a lot of

      16      people -- a lot of bad things can happen to a lot of

      17      people in that time frame, but when we do get in, we

      18      can't immediately let them know that this guy was

      19      the informant, all right, because maybe we're using

      20      the informant for an ongoing investigation.

      21             So, I want you to understand it's just not

      22      that easy for somebody in the community to come up

      23      and tell either one of the sheriffs or the officer

      24      from Penn Yan that "There's a drug dealer next to my

      25      house."







                                                                   44
       1             We probably already know that, but we can't

       2      just get in.

       3             So, in the interest of keeping this short,

       4      I would like to tell you that, several years ago --

       5      I don't know if it was seven, eight years ago -- the

       6      State of New York, not necessarily these fine

       7      Senators and our Assemblyman, said:  The Rockefeller

       8      drug laws from the 1970s are Draconian in nature.

       9      They're just bad laws, and our jails are

      10      overpopulated with drug users and drug dealers.

      11             And they said, We need to change that.

      12             And they changed it.

      13             And when they said "We need to change that,"

      14      the District Attorneys Association of the State of

      15      New York looked and said, That's going to create a

      16      problem.

      17             Well, here we are, seven, eight years later,

      18      and we've got that problem.

      19             So my suggestion to you guys is:

      20             Help the people that are addicted, for sure.

      21             Give the judges an out so they can help the

      22      people that are addicted.

      23             But as far as the people that are dealing

      24      these drugs, they got to go to prison, and I say put

      25      a mandatory minimum prison sentence, and you can







                                                                   45
       1      give them a maximum sentence too, it doesn't matter.

       2             But they've got to do some sort of prison, so

       3      that the judges -- and, I'm sorry, I don't want to

       4      offend anybody here, but sometimes we have some

       5      pretty liberal judges that think nobody should go to

       6      jail, nobody should go to prison.

       7             Well, I'm telling you, you want to stop some

       8      of this from going on, you have to put these people

       9      in prison, the people that are selling it, that are

      10      making the money.

      11             Like Assistant DA Cook said, there are people

      12      out there that are making money, and they're killing

      13      our own citizens.

      14             And so I say, you create a stronger

      15      punishment for the dealers.

      16             And you create a special crime for a dealer

      17      that has provided heroin to somebody, or another

      18      opiate, and they die, and that crime should be

      19      elevated, and it should be a separate crime.

      20             And I know there's other things that can be

      21      in there, but that should be a separate crime.

      22                  [Applause.]

      23             DA JOSEPH G. FAZZARY:  Thank you.

      24             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Joe.

      25             That's very helpful, and it's a great segue







                                                                   46
       1      into our second panel.

       2             We've got our -- initially, our largest panel

       3      out of the way.

       4             Thank you for the law-enforcement respective.

       5             A number of people I'm talking about on the

       6      panel, the next panel is our judges.

       7             We have the Honorable Patrick Falvey,

       8      Yates County Court Judge, and the

       9      Honorable Matthew Conlon, Penn Yan Village Court

      10      Justice.

      11             I want to thank you, Your Honors, for both

      12      being with us this evening, and, hopefully, being

      13      able to share some of your perspectives from the

      14      bench; and, particularly, as it regards drug courts

      15      and alternatives, or, particularly, lack of

      16      alternatives, that you may see in the struggles you

      17      deal with, and how to handle some of these cases,

      18      particularly with regards to the addicts in that.

      19             And, Judge Falvey, you've been our county

      20      court judge here in Yates County for a long time

      21      now.

      22             I thank you for your many years of service,

      23      and look forward to your perspective here.

      24             Thank you for being here.

      25             HON. W. PATRICK FALVEY:  Thank you,







                                                                   47
       1      Senator O'Mara, and Senators, and Mr. Assemblyman,

       2      and it's great to see everyone in the community here

       3      tonight, and showing their interest in this very

       4      serious issue that we have before us.

       5             Among my duties as county judge and family

       6      court judge, et cetera, I preside over the treatment

       7      court, the Yates County Drug Treatment Courts, and

       8      I've done that since its inception in 2002.

       9             And I just wanted to give a little overview

      10      of what our treatment courts are.

      11             Our treatment courts are a collaborative

      12      approach of the bench; the bar, which is prosecution

      13      and defense; treatment providers; probation and law

      14      enforcement; and it's there to stem, or attempt to

      15      stem, the overwhelming impact of drug-related

      16      offenses facing the criminal justice system.

      17             Participants are those convicted of certain

      18      crimes who face the possibility of jail or a state

      19      prison sentence.

      20             Some have co-dependent disorders, such as

      21      mental-health issues as well.

      22             The objective is to rehabilitate alcohol or

      23      substance-abuse offenders while protecting the

      24      community, by reducing drug-related crimes and

      25      reducing recidivism through a program of intensive







                                                                   48
       1      court supervision and treatment.

       2             The ultimate goal that we are trying to

       3      obtain is to break the cycle of addiction and create

       4      an environment which encourages law-abiding conduct,

       5      education, and gainful employment.

       6             Participants must be approved for

       7      participation after being evaluated, to determine

       8      that they have a drug or alcohol abuse or

       9      dependency, and have agreed to participate by

      10      signing a contract to complete the program

      11      successfully.

      12             Participants are on probation.

      13             Some are even required to serve time in jail

      14      first, depending on their crime, and all agree to

      15      follow through with treatment and attend

      16      drug-treatment court.

      17             They are subject to random drug and alcohol

      18      testing, and being drug- and alcohol-free for at

      19      least one year makes a participant eligible for

      20      graduation, followed, usually, by a continuation on

      21      probation as a form of aftercare.

      22             Now, relapse or dishonesty will subject the

      23      participant to graduated sanctions, including

      24      community service, time in jail, or discharge from

      25      the program.







                                                                   49
       1             In addition, appropriate conduct by a

       2      participant is as important as maintaining sobriety.

       3      It's an absolute requirement, in our opinion.

       4             Therefore, failure to conduct oneself

       5      appropriately by not following the rules, or

       6      committing a new crime, may result in immediate

       7      expulsion and a potential sentence to prison.

       8             So, drug court is not easy.  It requires the

       9      participant to take responsibility to achieve

      10      success.

      11             And since the inception of our treatment

      12      court, we have dealt with abuse of or addictions to

      13      alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamines,

      14      synthetic drugs, prescription medicines, opioids,

      15      and now, of course, heroin.

      16             That's why we're here.

      17             I believe, as many of my colleagues, that

      18      drug courts were created to differentiate between

      19      those with substance-abuse disorders and drug

      20      dealers selling for profit.

      21             This gave us great latitude in determining

      22      the circumstances of a particular case in order to

      23      measure if a person truly was an addicted or

      24      dependent, or, was selling for profit.

      25             However, which has already been alluded to,







                                                                   50
       1      in 2009, with the reform of the Rockefeller drug

       2      laws, legislation entitled judicial-diversion

       3      program for certain felony offenders was passed.

       4             This expanded the type of drug and marijuana

       5      crimes that could be considered for drug court,

       6      including serious felonies involving persons who

       7      were selling drugs for profit.

       8             Now, this has caused us to struggle, for,

       9      before, sellers were usually not qualified for the

      10      program, but now they can be by statute.

      11             For instance, we now need to consider and

      12      determine "what is a sale under the law?" for a sale

      13      does not always involve the exchange of money, or

      14      whether the person is selling to support a habit, or

      15      doing so for profit.

      16             Now, I also believe that use and sale of

      17      heroin is only the tip of the iceberg, for I see the

      18      influx of heroin, other drugs, and alcohol in our

      19      family court as well, with devastating effects,

      20      resulting in child neglect, abuse, domestic

      21      violence, juvenile delinquency, educational issues.

      22             This leads to social and monetary costs to

      23      the community not only for incarceration and foster

      24      care, but expenses for children born of addicted

      25      mothers, and the general breakdown of the family







                                                                   51
       1      unit.

       2             Currently, we are seeing more treatment-court

       3      participants resulting from possession, sale, and

       4      use of heroin.

       5             In the past, approximately 69 percent of our

       6      participants were addicted in some form to alcohol.

       7             And now almost 90 percent are addicted to

       8      heroin; yet, heroin has been around for a long time.

       9             I recall its scourge when in Vietnam 46 years

      10      ago.

      11             It is still here today, however, because it's

      12      inexpensive and so dangerously addictive.

      13             It attacks the very social fabric of our

      14      community, our sense of order, children, families,

      15      and society.

      16             Therefore, I would respectfully recommend to

      17      this honorable panel the following:

      18             First, treatment options.

      19             In the long run, successful treatment does

      20      work, and the community and public health clearly,

      21      I believe, benefits, especially in the comparison to

      22      costly -- the costly temporary solution of housing a

      23      person in state prison, or a child in foster care or

      24      detention, for an extensive period of time, and

      25      recovery is still not achieved.







                                                                   52
       1             Therefore, the State should encourage more

       2      Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services,

       3      called "OASAS," certified treatment facilities with

       4      emphasis in the rural areas, and increase staffing

       5      for existing treatment facilities for all types of

       6      treatment, especially outpatient and halfway houses,

       7      including addressing specific treatment needs unique

       8      to women, children, and, yes, men.

       9             The Department of Health or OASAS or some

      10      other agency of the state should collect data to

      11      determine which treatment elements offer the most

      12      success for recovery of addiction, so that those

      13      elements can be incorporated into patient care

      14      statewide and avoid duplication of expense and time.

      15             For example, data on Vivitrol as a treatment

      16      element should be evaluated, and treatment protocols

      17      examined, to see what is most effective.

      18             The State could encourage health-insurance

      19      companies to provide coverage for those treatment

      20      elements found to be most successful.

      21             Early detection:

      22             Prevention in the form of early detection of

      23      drug and alcohol use by our young people is key.

      24             More intensive monitoring by family and

      25      friends who are not afraid to speak up is needed to







                                                                   53
       1      recognize there is an issue before they grow into

       2      the extent of heroin use.

       3             This would help address the demand,

       4      I believe, for the drug as well.

       5             Crime prevention:

       6             I strongly urge the Legislature to consider

       7      modifying the judicial-diversion statute by

       8      excepting out drug sellers, in order to allow the

       9      treatment courts, in collaboration with law

      10      enforcement who are on our on staffing teams, more

      11      flexibility to determine the eligibility, on a

      12      case-by-case basis, in order to determine if a

      13      person is truly addicted, or is selling for profit.

      14             I believe the rise of heroin in our community

      15      shows the drug-court concept is even more important

      16      and relevant now to help identify those who are

      17      substance-abuse-dependent versus one who is a

      18      seller.

      19             Although incarceration may be the necessary

      20      and proper temporary solution, I believe successful

      21      treatment provides the best chance for the better

      22      long-term result of recovery and a successful return

      23      to society.

      24             One of the ten key components to the

      25      successful drug court is partnership with the







                                                                   54
       1      support of the community, people such as yourselves.

       2             Together we have achieved some successes.

       3             We have 71 graduates to date.

       4             While at the same time, this current heroin

       5      epidemic has challenged us all -- law enforcement,

       6      courts, treatment -- to rethink and retool our

       7      assets in order to continue to assure community

       8      acceptance, community safety, and reduction in

       9      recidivism through judicially-supervised treatment.

      10             I thank this honorable Task Force for the

      11      opportunity to address you this evening.

      12             Thank you.

      13                  [Applause.]

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Judge Falvey.

      15             And just briefly, before we move on to

      16      Justice Conlon, the -- I'm going to go out of order

      17      on the next panel, primarily because my neck is

      18      getting stiff looking left for this long.

      19             So I'm going to go over to the right for

      20      another panel, all the way down to the end, next.

      21             So, get ready down there.  I don't want you

      22      to sweat any more than you're already sweating,

      23      waiting for this to happen.

      24             But -- and to go, briefly, perhaps,

      25      politically, back to 2009, when the Rockefeller drug







                                                                   55
       1      laws were voted out, two of us here were in office,

       2      Senator Amedore and myself.  We were in the Assembly

       3      at that time in the Republican Minority, and we both

       4      voted "no" on that action at that time.

       5             There was a period in New York State's modern

       6      history, the only two years of which the

       7      New York State Senate had a majority of Democrats.

       8             That was the year in which the Rockefeller

       9      drug laws were taken away.

      10             The next year was the year that the

      11      gap-elimination adjustment was put in in our local

      12      school districts, to cut into deficits that we had

      13      from overspending in New York State, which cut

      14      drastically into our schools and our programs and a

      15      lot of extra activities, that I think would be

      16      helpful and useful for the prevention aspects of

      17      what we talk about as part of our processes here.

      18             That's just a side note, but I wanted to make

      19      it clear where I stood on the Rockefeller drug-law

      20      reforms, and I know Senator Amedore did as well.

      21             So with that, Justice Conlon, thank you for

      22      being here with us.

      23             HON. MATTHEW CONLON:  I'd like to thank

      24      everyone for coming out tonight, and thank the

      25      Senators for having us.







                                                                   56
       1             As Penn Yan Village Justice, I hear over

       2      200 cases per month, making Penn Yan Village Court,

       3      far and away, the busiest justice court in

       4      Yates County.

       5             Of those 200-plus cases, well over 80 percent

       6      are criminal cases, and of those criminal cases,

       7      over half are drug-related.

       8             Approximately one-third of the drug-related

       9      criminal cases I hear involve heroin directly.

      10             That's about one a day.

      11             Additionally, not included in that statistic,

      12      are cases that involve heroin indirectly, such as

      13      personal crimes, including assaults over drug deals

      14      gone bad, and, property crimes, such as burglary and

      15      larceny to support a drug habit.

      16             As a local attorney for over 25 years, I both

      17      prosecuted and defended individuals caught up in the

      18      vicious cycle of drug abuse.

      19             I participated in the federally-sponsored

      20      drug treatment-court training, as Judge Falvey

      21      alluded to, mandated at the inception of the local

      22      treatment courts a decade ago, and I have

      23      participated in the treatment courts in Yates,

      24      Seneca, and Ontario counties.

      25             As a sitting justice and a practicing lawyer,







                                                                   57
       1      I urge a greater commitment to the education of town

       2      and village justices.

       3             I know of no town or village justice that

       4      I have talked to that wouldn't appreciate more

       5      training, and especially more training in the area

       6      of drug crimes.

       7             Specifically, I wish to note the dubious

       8      distinction that New York leads the nation in the

       9      percentage of town and village justices that are not

      10      legally trained.

      11             While this may have made sense 100 years ago,

      12      we are now dealing with heroin.

      13             We are now confronted with often

      14      sophisticated drug dealers who use cell phones and

      15      the Internet in their drug trade.

      16             We are using an antiquated nineteenth-century

      17      justice court system to confront a modern

      18      twenty-first-century problem.

      19             I think it's shocking to know that New York

      20      requires only 12 hours a year of training for town

      21      and village justices, less than that required to be

      22      a licensed beautician or manicurist in the state of

      23      New York.

      24             We local judges are often called on to review

      25      search-warrant applications, rule on complex







                                                                   58
       1      evidentiary issues, and conduct hearings at the very

       2      outset of the beginning of serious drug cases.

       3             In drug cases we have to be familiar with

       4      such terms as "aggregate weight," "possession with

       5      intent to sell," and the "reagent test."

       6             An amateur judge, however well-meaning, is

       7      much more likely to make an error on a legal ruling

       8      or in the application of criminal-procedure law than

       9      a lawyer justice.

      10             This sometimes results in big-time drug

      11      dealers going free because of some technical error

      12      on the part of an untrained local justice.

      13             I do see hope, however, that no time in my

      14      25-year legal career have I seen more lawyer

      15      justices than I do now.

      16             And I note that we have lawyer justices in

      17      Seneca County, in Ontario County, in Wayne County,

      18      and I think this is the growing trend among

      19      New York's justice courts.

      20             I think it's time to level the playing field

      21      so that the judges have the same training and

      22      expertise as those who argue cases before them.

      23             We owe that to the crime victims as much as

      24      to those standing accused of crimes.

      25             Until lawyer justices are the rule and not







                                                                   59
       1      the exception in New York, I urge the State to

       2      address this lack of training and education for town

       3      and village justices, particularly as it relates to

       4      drug crimes, to ensure that all offenders, including

       5      those caught up in this scourge of heroin, are dealt

       6      with fairly according to the law.

       7             Thank you.

       8             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Judge.

       9                  [Applause.]

      10             SENATOR O'MARA:  And now we're going to shift

      11      over to the right with our panel of individuals who

      12      have been impacted personally by the heroin epidemic

      13      that we struggle with in our communities, and that

      14      panel is made up of:

      15             Janet Heaven;

      16             Arianna Chadwick and Donna McKay;

      17             Alexis Pleus, Truth Pharm;

      18             Devon Pierce;

      19             And, Gail Owen.

      20             Janet, are you comfortable with leading us

      21      off?

      22             Thank you.

      23             Thank you for being here.

      24             JANET HEAVEN:  Hi.

      25             Hi, my name is Janet Heaven.







                                                                   60
       1             My husband and I lost our son on January 5,

       2      2016, because of heroin.

       3             Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to

       4      tell our story.  Our hearts are broken.

       5             Chad James Heavens spent two weeks in the

       6      ICU, Rochester General Hospital, starting on

       7      December 23, 2015, and ending on January 5, 2016.

       8             His body was septic.  He had no known

       9      infection.  He had a 105 fever.  He had hepatitis C.

      10      His blood pressure was off the charts.  He had a

      11      collapsed lung.

      12             He was never conscious during those two weeks

      13      in the hospital.

      14             The doctors were not sure what exactly

      15      happened.

      16             We had to make the horrible decision to let

      17      him go.

      18             It could have been a bad needle.

      19             It could have been a bad batch of heroin.

      20             It could have been an overdose.

      21             It could have been any number of things, but

      22      the end result was death.

      23             The reason I want to speak to all of you is

      24      to try and save other addicts, parents, family

      25      members, from this incredible pain and having to go







                                                                   61
       1      through the horrific ordeal.

       2             We need to raise awareness and provide

       3      education, treatment, and most of all, prevention.

       4             Our son was a great fun-loving child full of

       5      life, fun, and energy.

       6             Here are a few pictures of him.

       7             You wont be able to see him, but there they

       8      are.

       9             No child hopes to become an addict when he

      10      grows up, and no parent hopes to raise an addict.

      11             No human is immune to this addiction.

      12             The addict is not the only person affected by

      13      this horrible drug.

      14             When people try to help an active addict,

      15      they are setting themselves up to be hurt.

      16             A heroin user will lie, cheat, steal, pawn,

      17      and do, basically, anything to get high.

      18             Nice people will offer them a place to stay,

      19      and the next thing you know, their money, jewelry,

      20      electronics are missing, and the addict has gone on

      21      to the next kind soul trying to help this person who

      22      can tell a great story and get what they need.

      23             My good friend says, "If a heroin addict's

      24      lips are moving, they're lying."

      25             This is so sad but true.







                                                                   62
       1             Our son started out -- started his

       2      experimentation with drugs in high school, drinking,

       3      pot, pills.

       4             The Stark Program which is a boot camp for

       5      kids, maybe it was helpful, but not enough.

       6             He had some minor brushes with law

       7      enforcement, and the use of marijuana and pills

       8      escalated to more powerful addictive drugs, and most

       9      recently, heroin.

      10             Parents and family members need to know what

      11      to do when their kids are using drugs, what their

      12      options are.

      13             Based on our experience, we feel long-term

      14      rehab, 90 days, is critical.

      15             After graduating from high school, our son

      16      joined the Army and he loved being in the Army.

      17             He spent time in Iraq and excelled at being a

      18      soldier.

      19             He was stationed in Hawaii, and later

      20      transferred to Colorado.

      21             He had two wonderful daughters who now have

      22      no father, and their mother is an active addict

      23      still in denial.  They both lost custody of their

      24      daughters because they were unable to get clean.

      25             Fortunately, the girls have been adopted by a







                                                                   63
       1      loving family.

       2             We helped our son numerous times to get help.

       3             He had been in four different 30-day rehabs,

       4      was fine for a while after he got out, but could not

       5      stay clean.

       6             We need to help our -- we tried to help our

       7      son, time and time again, by giving him clothing,

       8      money, a car to drive, and a place to stay.

       9             When our son was clean and sober, he was

      10      awesome.

      11             When he was using, he was not a pleasant

      12      person and we lived in fear.

      13             He had been arrested a couple of times for

      14      stealing and was in jail for a few days or weeks at

      15      a time.

      16             I can remember, as awful as this may seem,

      17      that I wished they would keep him in jail, because

      18      I knew he had three meals a day and a place to lay

      19      his head at night.

      20             If I may, I'd like to talk about some myths

      21      and clarify them with facts on my own experience.

      22             Myth:  Heroin is cheap.

      23             Fact:  Heroin is not cheap.

      24             It cost my son numerous Xboxes,

      25      PlayStations, TVs, furniture, jewelry, watches,







                                                                   64
       1      phones, cars, and more.

       2             It cost him his dignity, his self-esteem, his

       3      self-respect.

       4             It cost him a decent apartment and all its

       5      furnishings, and, sadly, his daughters.

       6             It cost him his life at the age of 28.

       7             Myth:  My friend gets it for me.

       8             The fact is, your heroin dealer is not your

       9      friend.  He or she is a heroin dealer.

      10             If he were your friend, you would be alive to

      11      talk about it.

      12             If he were your friend, you wouldn't have

      13      gotten started in the first place because friends

      14      don't want their friends dead.

      15             Hold on.

      16             Myth:  Heroin dealers look like thugs.

      17             And the fact is, they can look like a

      18      choirboy, be well-spoken, well-mannered, very

      19      charming, and come from a decent home just like you

      20      did.

      21             Myth:  Heroin is the ultimate high.

      22             The fact is, while the rush lasts minutes,

      23      withdrawal symptoms are always waiting for you.

      24             They include muscle and bone pain, diarrhea

      25      and vomiting, abdominal cramps, insomnia,







                                                                   65
       1      restlessness, runny nose, cold flashes and

       2      goosebumps, sweating, involuntary kicking motions,

       3      racing pulse, high blood pressure, increased

       4      respiratory rate, and severe anxiety.

       5             Myth:  I can handle it.

       6             The fact is:

       7             Chad James Heaven, December 18, 1987, to

       8      January 5, 2016.

       9             James and Janet Heaven, parents who lost

      10      their son, Chad, 28, on January 5, 2016, to heroin.

      11             Please feel free to ask me any questions, and

      12      I am open and honest and willing to share my

      13      thoughts and feelings.

      14             Thank you for your time.

      15                  [Applause.]

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Wow.

      17             Janet, thank you very much for sharing that

      18      with us, and we're so sorry for what you've been

      19      through, and for your loss of your son.

      20             JANET HEAVEN:  Thank you.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Truly, it's an unbelievable

      22      account of the tragedy of what we're dealing with

      23      here.

      24             So thank you so much for being here this

      25      evening.







                                                                   66
       1             JANET HEAVEN:  You're welcome.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  Arianna and Donna, you two

       3      are together?  Or are you -- okay.

       4             ARIANNA CHADWICK:  My name is

       5      Arianna Chadwick.

       6             I overdosed on January 7, 2016, and the whole

       7      experience was completely shocking in every way that

       8      you can imagine.

       9             There was the obvious, Oh, my God, what

      10      happened?  Who are all these people in my house?

      11             Then it hit me, this overwhelming feeling of

      12      guilt and embarrassment, and the thought of, Oh,

      13      great, now I'm just a junky to all these people.

      14             And it's that guilt and embarrassment that

      15      prevents so many from getting help, especially in

      16      these small towns.

      17             Our community has done a lot to get rid of

      18      that stigma.

      19             Now we actually need to put the resources

      20      together and offer ways for people to get help and

      21      make it easy to access.

      22             Finding the resources to get help shouldn't

      23      be such a difficult thing.

      24             When the problem is bad, information on any

      25      resources to help with the substance abuse should be







                                                                   67
       1      readily available.

       2             I think there should be a website that is a

       3      database of resources that you can search by county

       4      for the entire state.

       5             Inpatient facilities, outpatient, sober

       6      living, NA meetings, substance-abuse counselors, all

       7      that information should be in one place because it

       8      is so overwhelming to figure out what is actually

       9      available in your area.

      10             I think we should offer a protocol to all

      11      hospitals in the state on how to deal with an

      12      overdose, because it's quite clear they don't know

      13      exactly how to handle it in these small communities.

      14             I understand being firm with a patient in my

      15      situation, but the doctors shouldn't be talking

      16      about your condition so loudly that the entire ER

      17      knows what is going on with you.

      18             The hospital just didn't know what to do or

      19      say to me.

      20             A social worker didn't come talk to me.

      21             They didn't talk to me about detox or rehab

      22      facilities.

      23             All they did was hand me a packet of

      24      information that YSAC had put together, and sent me

      25      on my way.







                                                                   68
       1             Thankfully, I have a family to help me

       2      navigate everything, but not everyone does.

       3             I think offering hospitals a basic protocol

       4      to handling overdose patients will make it easier to

       5      make sure everyone gets offered the same information

       6      and care.

       7             I think an amnesty program would be

       8      beneficial to the addicts in our area.

       9             There were so many nights where all I wanted

      10      to do was go get help, but there is nowhere to go in

      11      our area at two in the morning.  And if there is,

      12      the addicts don't know about it.

      13             The window to actually help someone isn't

      14      that big.

      15             They need to be able to get the help when

      16      they want it, because it is so hard to talk yourself

      17      into taking that step and to find the motivation to

      18      try.

      19             I also want to ask you to take into

      20      consideration that what works in bigger cities might

      21      not work in rural communities like ours.  That there

      22      probably won't be examples of programs that were

      23      successful for communities like ours because heroin

      24      being such a big problem in rural areas is a

      25      relatively new thing.







                                                                   69
       1             So we might just have to take a chance and

       2      try different programs until we find one that fits.

       3             I understand that it's frustrating, from a

       4      legislative point of view, because it is hard to

       5      justify spending our money on something that isn't a

       6      guarantee.

       7             But if it helps just a few people, then it

       8      was successful, especially in the eyes of the family

       9      affected by this addiction.

      10             Thank you so much for allowing me to speak.

      11                  [Applause.]

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      13             Thank you, Arianna, for sharing that with us.

      14             I know that it's not easy to talk about that.

      15             It's not easy to talk in front of a crowd of

      16      people like this either.

      17             Donna is with you.

      18             Did you have anything you wanted to add,

      19      Donna?

      20             DONNA McKAY:  Hi.

      21             Thank you for allowing me to do this.

      22             I'm here as a community member, as well as an

      23      aunt to a recovering addict.

      24             I just wanted to talk a little bit about the

      25      insurance.  I know we already touched on that.







                                                                   70
       1             It's a big issue.

       2             And Ari's right, that when somebody goes

       3      forward and they say, "I need help," they need it

       4      then.

       5             They can't wait 24 hours.  They can't wait

       6      until the next week.

       7             They need it right then and there.

       8             I was doing some research online, and

       9      I firmly believe that we cannot arrest our way out

      10      of this.

      11             I'm not saying that some people don't need to

      12      be arrested, but I -- I want to mention that, also,

      13      that the most -- most of the dealers around here are

      14      addicts themselves.

      15             You get in the bigger cities, then you have

      16      the ones who aren't addicts.

      17             But I'm pretty sure, what from I've heard,

      18      and the people I've talked to, that, around here,

      19      they're addicts as well.

      20             So, to the amnesty program, I found one that

      21      a chief of police in Gloucester, Massachusetts,

      22      created, and it's called" Police-Assisted Addiction

      23      and Recovery Initiative."

      24             From what I read, the program allows for

      25      people to bring in their drugs and drug







                                                                   71
       1      paraphernalia, and not be arrested or serve any jail

       2      time for possession.

       3             They are also immediately taken to a hospital

       4      or facility for detox and hooked up with an ANGEL.

       5             The ANGEL will be with them for the entire

       6      process to offer support and encouragement.

       7             And from there, other resources are available

       8      to help them continue with their recovery.

       9             Although I am told that they wouldn't be

      10      arrested or jailed if they walked in the sheriff's

      11      department here, and asked for help, there is

      12      nothing that is set in stone.

      13             I believe that if it was put on paper and

      14      advertised and gotten around our community, that

      15      people would start to feel more comfortable and come

      16      forward for help.

      17             This program can help conquer two things:

      18      getting drugs and paraphernalia off the streets, and

      19      getting help for those who want help.

      20             In my opinion, this would be a huge step

      21      forward.

      22             I also have done some research on

      23      sober-living homes.  Studies have shown that

      24      aftercare programs such as this can better one's

      25      chances at avoiding relapse and maintaining







                                                                   72
       1      sobriety.

       2             According to a study that was highlighted in

       3      the "Journal of Psychoactive Drugs," abstinence

       4      rates went from 11 percent, to 68 percent, over

       5      6- and 12-month follow-ups, and another facility

       6      with had an increase, from 20, to 40 percent, after

       7      just 6 months in sober-living homes.

       8             These are great results, considering the

       9      success rate for heroin users trying to quit on

      10      their own is a mere 4 percent.

      11             These homes are designed to offer a clean,

      12      healthy, well-structured environment, peer support,

      13      healthy activities, freedom to make their own

      14      healthy choices, allows them to be responsible for

      15      themselves.

      16             It teaches the living skills, like cooking

      17      and money management, which is so important, and

      18      offers a place for them to grow in success and

      19      self-worth.

      20             This, without a doubt, is worth it.

      21             Going to elementary level, middle-school

      22      level, as part of a prevention method, I believe

      23      that our community center needs to have some

      24      activities for us to do, for where to take our

      25      children.







                                                                   73
       1             We have nothing to take our children to.

       2             I know they started a weight, exercise,

       3      place, but I'm talking like, pool, like a public

       4      pool, laser tag, something fun, roller skating,

       5      something to get -- and not just thrown out there

       6      for anybody to walk into and just use, but to have

       7      it managed by responsible people and people who are

       8      overlooking and overseeing this.

       9             So, it's also creating jobs.

      10             Just wanted to put that out there.

      11             And I understand that this is a lot to ask,

      12      but is it worth it?

      13             Is it worth the price of our community

      14      members' lives to ignore that these are real

      15      possibilities?

      16             And, thank you.

      17                  [Applause.]

      18             SENATOR AMEDORE:  Hi, Donna.

      19             It's Senator Amedore.

      20             And, you know, you mentioned the initiative

      21      from Massachusetts, and I think it's "P.A.A.R.I.,"

      22      that it -- what it spells out.

      23             And the Task Force, both Senator Murphy and

      24      myself, today we were in Oneonta, and talking to

      25      sheriffs that implement this initiative.







                                                                   74
       1             So it is here.

       2             It's something that we're going to be -- the

       3      Task Force is going to be looking at more into, so

       4      that we can implement, possibly, some of the

       5      initiatives of that particular program, and see how

       6      we can adapt it.

       7             You also mentioned a community center.

       8             And one of things that OASAS has just

       9      announced was their "clubhouse" programs that they

      10      are starting to put in in specific regions.

      11             So, with some time, hopefully, we'll see in

      12      this region, and I'm sure Senator O'Mara will be

      13      working on a clubhouse to be brought into an area

      14      here in the 58th Senate District, and that will

      15      help with the community activities.

      16             Thank you.

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much, Donna,

      18      for sharing that with us, and for your involvement

      19      with Arianna in helping through this very difficult

      20      situation.

      21             It's extremely important to have that kind of

      22      support, which is often lacking in these -- in many

      23      of these situations, but, certainly not -- certainly

      24      not all.

      25             Next up, Alexis.







                                                                   75
       1             Ready to go?

       2             ALEXIS PLEUS:  Hi.

       3             Thank you.

       4             I'm going to read for a change.

       5             If I talk, I'll just keep talking all night.

       6             I'm the mother of three sons, but today I'm

       7      here to tell you about my firstborn son Jeff.

       8             Jeff was a good student, popular, and a great

       9      athlete.

      10             He was charismatic, kind, and always stuck up

      11      for the underdog.

      12             He was absolutely passionate about everything

      13      that he did.

      14             He graduated high school in 2004, and went on

      15      to college, and even played football and wrestled

      16      there.

      17             Upon completion, he was a chef at excellent

      18      restaurants.  He was very successful, and he lived

      19      independently.

      20             In 2011 I got a phone call that my son had

      21      been arrested for house burglaries; my son, my son

      22      who was raised well, and as far as I knew, had never

      23      gotten in trouble beyond speeding tickets.

      24             I was devastated, but even more so, when

      25      I met with the public defender, and when I said to







                                                                   76
       1      him, "My son couldn't have done this," he said to

       2      me, "A lot of things that heroin addicts do don't

       3      make sense."

       4             You could have knocked me over with a

       5      feather.

       6             When Jeff got out of jail, he hooked up with

       7      a gal who had a toddler boy already.

       8             I had custody of this child more than once

       9      due to their active addiction and heroin use.

      10             Jeff and the mother wanted and attempted to

      11      get treatment on more than one occasion.

      12             We had times he was shaking and sweating on

      13      my couch, going into withdrawals, while we called

      14      our local detox center every hour on the hour, as

      15      they instructed us to do to meet the bed lottery.

      16             He did, at one point, get inpatient treatment

      17      in Syracuse, but he had to fake being suicidal to

      18      get them to keep him for an entire 21 days, and even

      19      he knew that that wasn't enough treatment.

      20             He begged me not to take him home, but they

      21      made me.

      22             He relapsed within a month.

      23             The gal became pregnant with my grandchild.

      24             And shortly after my son was arrested and

      25      sent to jail again, I was given custody of her son,







                                                                   77
       1      and she entered treatment at an inpatient methadone

       2      clinic, where she met a new fellow.

       3             He signed on as the father of my grandson

       4      when he was born in June of 2013.

       5             At that time, the child I had custody of was

       6      given back to her through County Services.

       7             Jeff spent eight months in jail, and was

       8      doing very well upon release.

       9             I truly felt like I had my son back.

      10             He had filed to establish paternity of his

      11      son, and was anxious to have his life fully in

      12      order, so that when he could see his son, he would

      13      be able to provide him with a wonderful home.

      14             My grandson was nearly eight months old when

      15      the judge finally ordered the DNA test.

      16             Two days later, and just one day prior to

      17      that scheduled DNA test, the baby died.  He was

      18      accidentally smothered during an afternoon nap by

      19      the boyfriend.

      20             Needless to say, Jeff was devastated.

      21             Remarkably, he soldiered on, maintaining

      22      sobriety for another six months, and I'll be forever

      23      grateful for that time with him.

      24             On Saturday, August 2, 2014, Jeff had his

      25      10th class-year reunion.  So many people who saw my







                                                                   78
       1      son said it was the greatest they had seen him look

       2      in years.

       3             Sunday, Jeff came over and we had a nice big

       4      family breakfast.

       5             Monday, Jeff went golfing with his dad and

       6      his little brother John and his girlfriend.

       7             Monday night, Jeff used heroin, and it killed

       8      him.

       9             On Tuesday morning, just 18 months ago, they

      10      found my son's body.

      11             Every day, from the day that I learned I was

      12      carrying my son, to the day of his death, he was

      13      loved, but love was not enough to conquer this

      14      addiction.

      15             I'm not sure what would have been enough for

      16      Jeff, but I know that he was not offered the types

      17      or lengths of treatment that we know to be

      18      effective, and there are types of treatment and

      19      lengths of treatment that we already know are proven

      20      to be effective.

      21             We just don't offer it here.

      22             Though to us the cost of our loss is beyond

      23      measure, I have taken to providing the economics of

      24      the situation in case there is any confusion at all

      25      about the cost to society and the taxpayer, and how







                                                                   79
       1      truly logical and what economic sense it makes to

       2      provide effective and long-term treatment for anyone

       3      who seeks it.

       4             The cost of Jeff and his fiancee's addiction

       5      are as follows:

       6             At least four separate criminal proceedings.

       7             A combined eleven months of jail stay between

       8      the two of them in two different jails.

       9             At least two criminal proceedings for the

      10      mother.

      11             At least four criminal proceedings for my

      12      son.

      13             Eighteen months of combined probation.

      14             Two hepatitis C treatments at $100,000 each.

      15      My son was hospitalized for sepsis and he nearly

      16      lost his arm.  Those were unpaid medical bills.

      17             Methadone program for the pregnant mother.

      18             My son and the mother were both on social

      19      services and Medicaid at the time, and he had a

      20      college degree.

      21             My son and the mother had many unpaid medical

      22      bills.

      23             There was a negligence proceeding against my

      24      son and the mother for having her child in their

      25      care while they were in the act of addiction.







                                                                   80
       1             These proceedings were run separately in

       2      family court, and included 4 Court-appointed

       3      attorneys, a County attorney, 2 County caseworkers,

       4      in addition to the court staff, and required over

       5      20 appearances over the course of a full year.

       6             There was foster care for the boy for

       7      eight months, and not to mention all the emotional

       8      damage that that child has suffered.

       9             There's all the victims of the crimes that

      10      the two committed.  Family members: father, mother,

      11      brothers, sister, grandmother was even stolen from;

      12      not to mention retailers.

      13             Family court custody proceedings for the

      14      little boy that I had custody of, which included

      15      four Court-appointed attorneys, a County attorney, a

      16      caseworker, in addition to the court staff.

      17             Between the custody hearings, visitation

      18      hearings, and violation proceedings, we were in

      19      family court over 40 times in the course of 3 years.

      20             The family had Family Services through the

      21      County for 18 months.

      22             And then, finally, the County coroner and the

      23      child-fatality review team to review the death of my

      24      grandchild.

      25             And then the County coroner for the autopsy







                                                                   81
       1      of my son.

       2             These are a great cost to our society, and

       3      I'm quite certain that if my son and his fiancee had

       4      been provided treatment, society would not have had

       5      these costs.

       6             I founded an advocacy organization called

       7      "Truth Pharm."

       8             We work to reduce the stigma and raise

       9      awareness.

      10             We create, implement, and advocate for

      11      programs and policy change to have a profound impact

      12      on the opioid epidemic.

      13             We're responsible for implementing four

      14      P.A.A.R.I. programs in our area.

      15             One of the problems that we'll have in

      16      New York State with implementing the P.A.A.R.I.

      17      programs is that our hospitals are not willing to

      18      participate as they were in Gloucester,

      19      Massachusetts, where they are willing to house

      20      people who were addicted until they could find

      21      treatment.

      22             In New York State, they're just not willing

      23      to do that.

      24             We also provide community-response action

      25      plans, and we've developed a best-practices







                                                                   82
       1      procedures for hospitals to handle overdoses.

       2             Unfortunately, hospitals aren't willing to do

       3      that, and they need to be required to do so.

       4             It isn't time for a Band-Aid.  It's time for

       5      a tourniquet.

       6             This epidemic is insane.

       7             Mothers are losing sons.  Fathers are losing

       8      daughters.  Siblings, like my boys, are left with

       9      the loss of their brothers and sisters for a

      10      lifetime.

      11             We're creating orphans at an alarming rate,

      12      which is anyone's guess what the consequence of that

      13      will be 10 to 20 years down the road.

      14             Everything that we do, aside from the things

      15      that I'm going to mention, in my opinion, are a

      16      waste of time right now.

      17             We have people right now who are dying and

      18      who need help, and who, literary, ask for help.

      19             I met with three other mothers before coming

      20      here this evening, so there's four mothers at the

      21      table.

      22             Three of us, our loved ones asked for help

      23      and sought help before they ever entered the

      24      criminal justice system.

      25             Our law-enforcement folks are doing an







                                                                   83
       1      incredible job trying to clean up this mess, but the

       2      problem is, we need to help people before they get

       3      to the criminal justice system, and we need to give

       4      them the help that they actually need, not some

       5      sub-partial treatment.

       6                  [Applause.]

       7             ALEXIS PLEUS:  Everyone says that what

       8      started this epidemic was this whole idea that we

       9      needed to treat people's pain.

      10             The thing that confuses me is that we're not

      11      doing the same thing for people who are addicted.

      12             They go to the hospital after an overdose.

      13      They've been revived with Narcan, and they're in

      14      severe pain, and we do nothing for them.

      15             We need absolutely, in New York State, to

      16      offer humane, medically-assisted detox, and that

      17      needs to happen immediately.

      18                  [Applause.]

      19             ALEXIS PLEUS:  There are other states that

      20      are offering same-day evaluations.

      21             We need to do that in New York State.

      22             We need immediate access to treatment.

      23             This isn't a situation where a person can

      24      wait days or weeks for treatment.  It's a matter of

      25      life or death.







                                                                   84
       1             And I'm going to allow the Senator to remain

       2      nameless who told me, that insurers are not going to

       3      allow this, because he's sitting at this table.

       4             But I'm going to tell you right now, we

       5      absolutely have to require insurers to pay for the

       6      type and length of treatment known to be effective.

       7                  [Applause.]

       8             ALEXIS PLEUS:  I'm not sure why he's allowing

       9      insurers to tell him what we're going to do with our

      10      laws.

      11                  [Applause.]

      12             ALEXIS PLEUS:  And, finally, we need to

      13      increase insurance reimbursement rates so that

      14      treatment centers can afford to open and operate in

      15      New York State.

      16             Thank you.

      17                  [Applause.]

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much, Alexis,

      19      for sharing this with us, and your difficult

      20      situations that you've been through, and your

      21      excellent ideas for us moving forward.  And your

      22      experiences in other states is very helpful as well.

      23             So thank you for being here with us tonight.

      24             Next we have Devon.

      25             DEVON PIERCE:  Thank you, sir.







                                                                   85
       1             I'm Devon Pierce.  I'm a recovering addict.

       2             I've been doing heroin since I was 16 years

       3      old, and it has destroyed my life.

       4             It has destroyed my family's life.

       5             It's destroyed the members of my church.

       6             It's destroyed their life.

       7             They have all been there to support me, and

       8      love me, and that is one huge thing, as an addict,

       9      is you need.

      10             So do not give up on your family members.

      11             Please, don't give up on them.

      12             They are not the same people when that drug

      13      is inside them as they are without that drug.

      14             We are loving, we do care, and we appreciate

      15      everything that you guys do.

      16             And as Sheriff Ron Spike said, he said, we

      17      hit them in high school -- we hit them -- well, we

      18      hit them at fifth grade with the D.A.R.E. committee.

      19             We don't hit them again in middle school.

      20             We don't hit them in high school.

      21             And I feel, that's what we need to do.  We

      22      need to push for this.

      23                  [Applause.]

      24             DEVON PIERCE:  What has been done now, it can

      25      be stopped, it can be prevented.







                                                                   86
       1             But, we can prevent the younger kids from

       2      going in the same steps that I took, and I don't

       3      want to see anybody fall down the same path that

       4      I went through.

       5             And whatever I can do to help, from families,

       6      family members that have addicts in their family,

       7      please ask.  I will be there to help.

       8             We have a Nar-Anon group in this community,

       9      and, I sit in that group and I hear the struggles,

      10      just like I hear the struggle coming from these

      11      women about their family and their losses.

      12             And I'm sorry for that, that this drug has

      13      taken your children.

      14             That has to hurt, I know it hurts, and it's

      15      horrible.

      16             That could have been me.

      17             And the Nar-Anon group is just a great group.

      18             The families get together, they talk about

      19      it, they try to help themselves.  They need to

      20      figure out something for themselves.

      21             And as addicts, we have nothing around here.

      22      We don't have any groups.

      23             I've heard of one Nar-Anon group since I've

      24      been home.

      25             Have I been able to participate in it?







                                                                   87
       1             No, because I don't know where it is.

       2             Do we have rehab in this community?

       3             No, we do not have a rehab in the community.

       4             It's something that we need.

       5             Right before I went to jail last time,

       6      September 2nd, I got arrested, I was going to turn

       7      myself into a rehab.  But on my way to a rehab,

       8      I can get drugs.

       9             Why not get high before I get to the rehab?

      10             You know, we need that, where we can go in,

      11      right in this community, and go in and say, Hey,

      12      I need help.

      13             You know, that's what we need here, as a

      14      community.

      15             I know this community can come together.

      16             We've done it.

      17             Look what we did for the flood.

      18             Look what we do for the school students.

      19             Penn Yan Mustangs, this is the home of

      20      Penn Yan Mustangs.

      21             We can do this, guys.

      22             And I'll ask for your help as addicts.

      23             I'm not speaking for all of them, but I'm

      24      speaking for myself.

      25             I need your help, so I can help other people,







                                                                   88
       1      please.

       2             And that is what I want to do, is help the

       3      other people that are in need.

       4             And I thank everybody for coming out here,

       5      guys.

       6             I really do.

       7             This means a lot, just so that you can hear

       8      my voice as an addict.

       9             This is awesome.

      10             Thank you.

      11                  [Applause.]

      12             DEVON PIERCE:  We also have groups that have

      13      participated in the jail ministry, the "Inside and

      14      Out" program, and that's for a transaction that,

      15      when you're in jail, these guys come in and talk to

      16      you, that help you, they support you, they love you.

      17             They're not giving you money so you can get

      18      food or anything like that, but they're giving you

      19      love, they're caring for you.  And that's what their

      20      biggest thing is, is love.

      21             It is a Christian-based thing, but, that's

      22      not who they come off as.  They just come off as

      23      people.  They come off as people who care.

      24             And it is a great program.

      25             The Nar-Anon program, as I said, for those







                                                                   89
       1      families that hurt, they need help.  They really

       2      need help.

       3             The AA meetings that we got going on around

       4      here, that's awesome, but do we have anything for

       5      narcotics?

       6             We do not have anything for the opioids.  We

       7      don't have anything for that.

       8             Yes, we have FLACRA.

       9             You got $30,000 a year to put yourself in

      10      FLACRA?

      11             Because I know I don't.

      12             We need help.

      13             We need to be able to walk to a program and

      14      get the help that we need, guys.

      15             And I ask for the help.

      16             Please, as an addict myself, I need the help.

      17             Please.

      18             Thank you so much, guys.

      19                  [Applause.]

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      21             Thank you so much, Devon, for being here and

      22      sharing that with us.

      23             I missed, or maybe you didn't say, how old

      24      are you?

      25             DEVON PIERCE:  I'm 23 now.

       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  23?

       2             DEVON PIERCE:  Yes.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  And how long has it been

       4      since --

       5             DEVON PIERCE:  Since my last use?

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yes.

       7             DEVON PIERCE:  September 2nd was my last

       8      use.

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Well, thank you, and good

      10      luck to you.

      11             DEVON PIERCE:  Thank you.

      12                  [Applause.]

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next we have Gail Owen.

      14             Gail, thank you for being with us.

      15             GAIL OWEN:  Yes.

      16             Thank you very much for allowing me to bend

      17      your ear for a moment here.

      18             First of all, those of you who know me, and

      19      I do see some familiar faces out here, this is way

      20      out of my comfort zone to speak to people like this.

      21             So, if I'm able to step out of my comfort

      22      zone for five minutes to help another family to not

      23      go through the bull -- baloney that I've been

      24      through, I've done my job.

      25             Not many people have heard this story that







                                                                   91
       1      I'm about to tell.

       2             And, my mother is sitting in the front row,

       3      and she has not heard this story, and no grandmother

       4      should have to hear this about their -- her

       5      grandson.

       6             So I apologize in advance, mom.

       7             The story I'm about to tell, I went to my son

       8      and told him what I was going to say.

       9             I got my son's permission to tell this story.

      10             And I told him what I was going to say, and

      11      he said, Mom, I don't remember any of that story.

      12      So you have my permission, but I don't remember any

      13      of that happening.

      14             So, now, speaking as a mother whose been

      15      through more than I have ever wanted to go through,

      16      here are some of my thoughts.

      17             A little over two years ago, in November of

      18      2013, my son came to me, asking me for help, as he

      19      was going through heroin withdrawals and he didn't

      20      know what to do, and neither did I.

      21             I first called my doctor as to what I should

      22      do with him.

      23             She said to take him to the emergency room.

      24             The emergency room doctor gave him a drug to

      25      treat the symptoms of withdrawals, and I was told to







                                                                   92
       1      take him to the Elmira detox center the next day.

       2             I remember crying to emergency room doctor

       3      before he was released to me at 1:00 in the morning,

       4      saying, "I don't want to take him home.  I don't

       5      know what he will do when the withdrawal drugs wear

       6      off."

       7             I was scared to death.

       8             What kind of mother does not want to take her

       9      child home?

      10             The fact was, he wasn't my child.

      11             It was the drugs that had taken him, and

      12      I had no control over it, and I just wanted my son

      13      back.

      14             I took him to the Elmira detox center the

      15      next day.

      16             Once we got there, we had to wait until a

      17      doctor could see him.

      18             During that five-hour wait, the drug that the

      19      emergency room doctor had given him the night before

      20      had worn off and he was out of control.

      21             He was so out of control that a security

      22      guard had to come and watch him.

      23             He tore his gown off and wrapped it around

      24      his neck.  He tried to take a plastic knife to his

      25      wrist.







                                                                   93
       1             He was a raging lunatic, he was a madman, he

       2      was totally out of control.

       3             He felt so horrible that he wanted to end his

       4      life.

       5             I stood outside his room and watched this

       6      happen.

       7             I had so many emotions as a mother: fear,

       8      helplessness, anger, frustration.

       9             I wanted to make everything right, and

      10      I couldn't.

      11             He stayed there for four days.

      12             Once he started using, he was always chasing

      13      that first high.

      14             On a positive note, he has been clean since

      15      September 12, 2014, which is the day he turned 24.

      16                  [Applause.]

      17             GAIL OWEN:  Prior to my son using heroin, he

      18      was picked up for five, and I said, yes, five UPM

      19      charges, which stands for "unlawful possession of

      20      marijuana," within a year and a half.

      21             Those are only tickets, which is just a

      22      monetary fine.

      23             I feel that these should be more than

      24      tickets.  The first one could be a ticket, but after

      25      the first ticket, it should be a tougher penalty.







                                                                   94
       1             This was definitely a pattern of drug use in

       2      which there was no consequence, other than hitting

       3      his wallet, and that didn't have any effect on him.

       4             Finding treatment for my son was a nightmare.

       5             There was no inpatient facilities in

       6      Penn Yan.

       7             When you do finally find an inpatient

       8      facility with an open bed, sometimes the wait is

       9      over a week, and by then, the addict has changed

      10      their mind about getting help.

      11             You have to fight with insurance companies to

      12      cover their stay.

      13             You need to strike when the iron is hot and

      14      get the addict into rehab immediately.

      15             Insurance wants you to fail at outpatient

      16      before they would consider paying for inpatient

      17      treatment.

      18             Inpatient treatment can be very expensive,

      19      costing thousands of dollars a month.

      20             My son's first rehab was 4 days in Elmira,

      21      and the second rehab was 14 days in Tully Hill.

      22             The third rehab was 30 days at G&G Holistic

      23      in Florida, and when I put hum on that plane in

      24      Syracuse, I didn't know whether I would ever see my

      25      son again.







                                                                   95
       1             There is FLACRA in Penn Yan, which is an

       2      outpatient, and is -- in my opinion, is not working,

       3      as they just find more connections to get drugs.

       4             The employees at FLACRA are good at their

       5      jobs, but we need more of them.

       6             Let's not forget the mental-health part of

       7      this.

       8             People have mental-health issues and they try

       9      to treat that problem with drugs and alcohol because

      10      seeking help for the problem is sometimes a stigma

      11      that shows weakness.

      12             Both my sons learned about the Just Say No

      13      program in fifth grade.

      14             The Just Say No program stopped at fifth

      15      grade.

      16             I am not sure how the middle school handles

      17      the topic of drugs, but maybe the Just Say No

      18      program could follow through to the middle school

      19      and beyond.

      20             The drugs and smoking issues seemed to start

      21      at a much younger age.

      22             Middle-school students seem to have little

      23      fear and peer pressure rears its ugly head.

      24             We need to start the education of dangers of

      25      drugs and alcohol at the elementary school in grades







                                                                   96
       1      third -- in third and fourth grade using appropriate

       2      language for them to understand.

       3             When children get to the middle school and

       4      academy, it may be too late.  Some may have already

       5      experimented with drugs and alcohol.

       6             If a student is willing to put an unnatural

       7      or unhealthy substance in their body, it shows to me

       8      that there is a willingness to do more dangerous

       9      actions.

      10             This is not always the case, but it could

      11      happen, and it did happen with my oldest son who

      12      started smoking pot in seventh grade.

      13             By the time my son got to the academy, he was

      14      smoking marijuana frequently, and I used to think

      15      that marijuana was the least of my worries.

      16             Boy, was I wrong.

      17             This is just a short synopsis of what I have

      18      done to help my son in his recovery.

      19             No parent should have to go through an ordeal

      20      like this.

      21             So in closing, I would like to see the

      22      following take place in Yates County:

      23             A program for the elementary students to

      24      learn about the dangers of drugs.

      25             Stiffer penalties for unlawful possession of







                                                                   97
       1      marijuana charges.

       2             A rehab center in Penn Yan.

       3             More outpatient facilities for addicts to go

       4      to for counseling.

       5             Insurance companies to recognize that this is

       6      a disease just like cancer and needs to be covered.

       7             Thank you for listening.

       8                  [Applause.]

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Gail, thank you very much.

      10             Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

      11             And I think with that bit of a segue, and

      12      thank you all, all of the individuals that are here

      13      to talk about your personal circumstances.

      14             Every circumstance has terrible consequences.

      15             They're all very different, but they all

      16      involve the same drug.

      17             And, I thank you for sharing, how difficult

      18      it is to share that with all of us here in a room

      19      full of this many people.

      20             And with that, I think we'll move into our

      21      educators that are here, and talk about what is

      22      going on as far as prevention in schools, what you'd

      23      like to see going on as far as prevention in your

      24      schools, and what it's going to take for you to be

      25      able to do that in your schools, because there's







                                                                   98
       1      none of us sitting up here that want to put another

       2      unfunded mandate on our school districts.

       3             So our panel here is:

       4             Superintendent Howard Dennis from Penn Yan;

       5             Superintendent Kelly Houck from Dundee;

       6             Superintendent Tommy Phillips from

       7      Watkins Glen.

       8             Howard, we'll start with you.

       9             Now, let me just point out, in the interests

      10      of time, I know you guys -- there's no need to read.

      11             We have your testimony, and it's fine to read

      12      if you want to, but don't feel you have to read the

      13      whole thing, because we have it in the record and

      14      it's part of our package.

      15             So, just hit the high notes, and I appreciate

      16      you being here.

      17             SUPT. HOWARD DENNIS:  Sure.

      18             I've been adjusting my speech throughout the

      19      evening, so, hopefully, it will make sense.

      20             But, thank you for the opportunity to speak

      21      tonight, because this is the premier challenge

      22      facing Yates County and Penn Yan.

      23             You know, as educators, every school

      24      district's mission includes educating and informing

      25      our students on a daily basis, and we teach health







                                                                   99
       1      curriculum in Penn Yan at the mandated levels,

       2      according to the State Education Department.

       3             But in the past, we were able to offer more.

       4             And I've heard tonight the reference to --

       5      many different times, to additional health

       6      education.

       7             I would agree with that.

       8             Unfortunately, the reality comes about that,

       9      over time, due to budget cuts, due to restructuring,

      10      we've had to cut back on additional programming that

      11      we've had.

      12             So any assistance that the state government,

      13      the State Legislature, could offer, as far as

      14      funding goes, that would be beneficial to our

      15      students.

      16             And I agree with you, Senator, the financial

      17      support without the unfunded -- without the mandate

      18      would be wonderful.

      19             The second thing that would be really helpful

      20      to us as a school district in Yates County and in

      21      Penn Yan is after-school programming.

      22             We want to have those positive role models.

      23             We want to have supportive and creative

      24      places for our students to go after school, so that

      25      we can offer possibilities for them.  And that's







                                                                   100
       1      become a board goal for us here in Penn Yan, is to

       2      push for more and more of those possibilities for

       3      our students.

       4             We want to be able to offer them education in

       5      those smaller settings, positive role modeling, and

       6      we want -- and, unfortunately, we're not able to

       7      offer those at this time due to the financial

       8      support that would be needed to establish and to

       9      continue those.

      10             I believe the Penn Yan community is very

      11      supportive and generous in the support that we can

      12      offer to our students.

      13             We're able to offer dedicated psychologists,

      14      social workers, youth counselors, guidance

      15      counselors, and other support professionals, but,

      16      obviously, it's not enough.

      17             You're hearing from some Penn Yan students

      18      tonight who have gone through the program.

      19             And, so, we need more of those.

      20             Right now, those are falling totally on the

      21      local taxpayers.  And, we need additional support in

      22      order to offer the services, because, as you've

      23      heard, those services aren't offered in our

      24      community, and so the school district wants to help

      25      step up and do as many of those things as we can.







                                                                   101
       1             But, again, the resources are tough.

       2             Once addicted, the individual then has to go

       3      on and look for counseling, and you've heard that

       4      many times this evening.  And the scarcity of those

       5      treatment facilities here in rural areas is

       6      difficult.

       7             You know, I heard a story recently about a

       8      community member on our staff who had convinced

       9      their family member that they needed help, and went,

      10      and finally worked through that entire process, and

      11      reach out to their insurance carrier.

      12             And I think you've leader this referred to

      13      tonight, the response from the insurance carrier was

      14      unbelievable.

      15             They didn't qualify for inpatient treatment

      16      because they hadn't failed enough times at

      17      outpatient treatment.

      18             And as we talk about the heroin epidemic and

      19      the outcome of that, that's an unbelievable

      20      statement for anyone to make, is that you have to

      21      fail enough times with that drug in order to qualify

      22      for higher level of services.

      23             You know, if you compare that scenario to the

      24      whole idea of being educated about anything, the

      25      treatment model that we have at this point is not







                                                                   102
       1      adequate.

       2             You know, learning, in general, doesn't

       3      happen in three or four days with no follow-up.

       4             And, so, anything that we can do in our

       5      community to help with that kind of follow-up and

       6      support for people in our community would be

       7      helpful.

       8             We're very fortunate in Penn Yan to have a

       9      school resource officer.  Our SRO is a village

      10      policeman.

      11             But, again, we have one person who is trying

      12      to maintain the level of education around drugs,

      13      trying to maintain relationships with kids, in a

      14      1500-student school district in 3 different

      15      buildings.

      16             That's a very tough -- that's a very tough

      17      situation for anyone to be in.

      18             And he does an excellent job for us, and

      19      we're very lucky to have him again.  But we could

      20      probably use three of him, and that would be tough

      21      for our community to step up and be able to support.

      22             Our County Legislature, as well, has talked

      23      about additional drug-enforcement staff.  And,

      24      again, the funding is a tough piece of that.

      25             And the district would be willing to help







                                                                   103
       1      step up and help support that in any way, but we do

       2      not have the funds to do that.

       3             Legislating stronger and harsher penalties

       4      for dealers is overwhelmingly encouraged.

       5             And many of the ideas that I received

       6      tonight, I actually went out and garnered from our

       7      staff.

       8             You know, I looked for support, including

       9      from some people on this panel, that stepped up and

      10      said, Howard, this is what needs to happen.  This is

      11      what you need to advocate for.  You have this

      12      opportunity, make sure you send this information

      13      along.

      14             So I am touching on some things that have

      15      been duplicated, but it's because they were

      16      important to our staff.

      17             So, you know, in conclusion -- I've cut quite

      18      a bit out of my speech.

      19             But, in conclusion, as to what others have

      20      said:

      21             We need your help with funding.  We need your

      22      help with legislative reform.

      23             And those are things that you have heard

      24      throughout the evening, so I'm grateful for the

      25      opportunity to reiterate some of those.







                                                                   104
       1             And thank you for the opportunity to speak.

       2                  [Applause.]

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much.

       4             Kelly.

       5             SUPT. KELLY HOUCK:  Thank you.

       6             Since Howard so graciously cut some of his,

       7      I'm going to keep all of mine.

       8             Thank you, Howard.

       9                  [Laughter.]

      10             SUPT. KELLY HOUCK:  And, also, before

      11      I begin, I want to thank you again for this

      12      opportunity.

      13             But, I feel like I would be remissed right

      14      now if I didn't thank the panel that went before me.

      15             You truly touched every one of us, and I know

      16      how difficult that was to share those stories.

      17             My heart aches for each and every one of you.

      18             Thank you for being so courageous and being

      19      here with us this evening.

      20             I appreciate that.

      21                  [Applause.]

      22             SUPT. KELLY HOUCK:  So my testimony is really

      23      a story of sorts.

      24             So I'm going to share a story from the

      25      Dundee Central School community, and with that,







                                                                   105
       1      I have some suggestions for help and assistance, and

       2      some need that we desperately have in our school,

       3      but also in our community.

       4             Heroin and other drug use has become an

       5      epidemic in our community and in our county.

       6             Just like any other epidemic, we must work

       7      together to eradicate it.

       8             This is something we cannot do alone;

       9      however, we can accomplish together.

      10             Everyone is part of the solution, and we

      11      cannot allow this growing and pervasive problem to

      12      touch or take one more life.

      13             In my school district of just over

      14      700 students, heroin has taken the life of a

      15      17-year-old girl, a high school senior with her

      16      entire life ahead of her; and a former

      17      Dundee Central School student, just a mere 23 years

      18      old, again, an individual with a whole life ahead of

      19      him.  This has happened in just a mere three months.

      20             And I cannot reiterate enough that,

      21      fortunately, I had the opportunity to get to know

      22      the 17-year-old student in my year and a half at

      23      Dundee, and she was not that kid.

      24             I cannot say that enough to you.

      25             She was not that kid.







                                                                   106
       1             And even though I didn't get to know the

       2      23-year-old that passed, from all the stories of his

       3      high school athleticism, he was not that kid either.

       4             This does not discriminate.  It touches

       5      everyone and anyone.

       6             Additionally, it has touched the lives of

       7      many faculty members and students, by not only their

       8      relationship with these two individuals; however,

       9      through their own family members who are currently

      10      struggling with addiction, or, even worse, still

      11      actively using despite their pleas and exhausting

      12      efforts to quit.

      13             It leads me to ask the question:  How many

      14      more people must die, or who must die, in order for

      15      this to finally be enough?

      16             I can't begin to explain or paint a picture

      17      that is vivid for each of you that accurately

      18      displays how heart-wrenching it is for me to send an

      19      e-mail to my entire faculty, that I need to have an

      20      emergency faculty meeting with them before class

      21      begins, to where I can share with them that we have

      22      lost another child, or how incredibly devastating it

      23      is to a student's classmates when faced with the

      24      harsh reality of the tragic loss of an untimely

      25      death of a fellow classmate.







                                                                   107
       1             Watching these students gather in the school

       2      foyer, carrying purple helium balloons with memories

       3      and messages of love and "I'll never forget yous,"

       4      as they walk as an inconsolable group to the funeral

       5      home to say their goodbyes to their classmate, their

       6      childhood friend, their fellow cheerleader, the

       7      person who they sat next to in English class since

       8      seventh grade.

       9             As I try to comfort them and help them

      10      through one of the most difficult times in their

      11      lives that they will ever experience, I find myself

      12      not being able to control my own thoughts and fears

      13      that this will not be the last time that we walk

      14      this walk.

      15             The cruel, harsh reality, it will only be a

      16      matter of time, unless significant, actionable, and

      17      tangible steps are taken to combat this epidemic.

      18             According to the American Society of

      19      Addiction and Medicine, drug overdose is the leading

      20      cause of accidental death in the United States.

      21             Opiate and heroin addiction is driving this

      22      epidemic.

      23             Four and five new heroin users started out

      24      misusing prescription painkillers.

      25             As a consequence, the rate of heroin-overdose







                                                                   108
       1      deaths nearly quadrupled from 2000 to 2013.

       2             In just 3 years, from 2010 to 2013, there was

       3      a 37 percent increase in heroin-overdose deaths.

       4             The current largest group of heroin users are

       5      between the ages of 18 and 25.  This group is also

       6      the cohort that continues to grow exponentially over

       7      all other age group and users.

       8             Adolescents, my students, your children, are

       9      falling victim to this addiction faster than we can

      10      intervene.

      11             Research has indicated that over

      12      30,000 adolescents have used heroin in the past

      13      year, and more than 50 percent have moved past into

      14      the world of addiction.

      15             These are national statistics, and, yes, they

      16      matter; however, honestly, the statistics that

      17      matter to me most are the ones that are occurring in

      18      our own county and in our own schools.

      19             I firmly believe that the solution to this

      20      problem is multi-faceted and involves many layers,

      21      with education being the center and the pillar that

      22      every layer is anchored to.

      23             We must be proactive in our approach to

      24      addressing heroin- and opiate-addiction epidemic.

      25             We now, more than ever, have the chance to







                                                                   109
       1      fight this epidemic, but we cannot wait.  We must

       2      combat this before it even begins.

       3             Effective, meaningful, and result-driven

       4      educational practices surrounding this issue

       5      requires resources.

       6             It's not just an option.  It is a necessity.

       7             Resources, such as financial assistance, and,

       8      people, such as full-time public-health educators in

       9      our schools to coordinate these efforts, is

      10      critical.

      11             We need the monetary support to procure

      12      people who are well-versed in this work, identifying

      13      the risk factors, creating intervention plans, and

      14      assisting preventing the addiction before it becomes

      15      a reality.

      16             With this comes the need for financial

      17      assistance with programs and outreach opportunities,

      18      as well as certain real-life experiences for our

      19      students to participate in, that clearly and vividly

      20      illustrate the dangers of involving themselves in

      21      this activity.

      22             Lectures and pamphlets and videos are not

      23      enough.

      24             We need to provide and create meaningful

      25      engagement for our students and their families, and







                                                                   110
       1      these need to be ongoing.

       2             This education cannot be a one-and-done

       3      platform or a six-week course.

       4             Our education strategy and implementation

       5      needs to be as pervasive as the heroin is in our

       6      community.

       7             This education needs to reach beyond the

       8      walls of our schools, and needs to act as seepage,

       9      seeping into our community and into our toughest

      10      neighborhoods.

      11             This work cannot be accomplished without

      12      proper financial resources and people needed to

      13      carry this work forward.

      14             We cannot continue trying to solve the

      15      problem by being active and expecting different

      16      results.  Our own local history clearly illustrates

      17      that the current methods are insufficient.

      18             Ultimately, even with the best education

      19      practice in place, we will not stop all heroin and

      20      opiate addiction.

      21             Therefore, another layer to the solution that

      22      I referenced in the beginning of this testimony

      23      involves treatment plans and facilities, which, at

      24      this point, in the great state of New York, are

      25      dismal at best, a clear picture of inadequate.







                                                                   111
       1             When the hardest decision of an addict's life

       2      has been made to help -- to seek help and assistance

       3      to begin the very difficult and challenging path of

       4      recovery, it is completely unacceptable that there

       5      is not a treatment facility or an option immediately

       6      available to them.

       7             When told that it will take two or

       8      three months, or even longer, to start the process,

       9      that we have, in sense, told the addict to keep

      10      using.

      11             These individuals are barely holding on

      12      minute to minute, and can't fathom how they will

      13      make it through another day, let alone a month, or

      14      longer, without using.

      15             And that is exactly what we are forcing them

      16      to do by not having adequate treatment facilities

      17      and recovery essentials available and accessible.

      18             School districts are having the hard and

      19      difficult conversations with our students and

      20      faculty.

      21             We impose accountability to the greatest

      22      extent or authority allows us to do so; however, we

      23      need all stakeholders to be part of this work.

      24             Parents, families, friends, community

      25      members, and our elected officials all must be part







                                                                   112
       1      of the solution.

       2             We need to invest in what matters, we need to

       3      invest in our future, we need to invest in our

       4      students' emotional, social, and mental health, in

       5      order to eradicate this epidemic.

       6             The treatment options and resources for

       7      addicts need to go beyond just addiction.

       8             We need to promote support, and provide

       9      better and stronger mental-health services for our

      10      students and communities.

      11             In attempting to make an appointment for a

      12      student in crisis to have a complete psychiatric

      13      evaluation, due to the clear and evident lack of

      14      resources and availability of mental-health

      15      services, it took two months for a student of mine

      16      to be even given an appointment.

      17             It is very transparent that there are

      18      significant mental-health issues and needs that are

      19      severely underdiagnosed; and, therefore, not

      20      treating, which is leading to an increased drug use

      21      and activity.

      22             We absolutely do not have any local control

      23      over the lack of mental-health services in our

      24      schools and in our communities.  A significant

      25      amount of preventive measures could take place if







                                                                   113
       1      the services were available.

       2             Additionally, support is needed by providing

       3      adequate funding and resources to our local law

       4      enforcement.  This must entail the addition of a

       5      drug investigator.

       6             It is evident that our county law enforcement

       7      does not have the resource or capacity to address

       8      the heroin and opiate epidemic that is eradicating

       9      and taking hold of our communities.

      10             To expect that any changes will result in

      11      using the current structure and system is nothing

      12      more than a fallacy.

      13             As an educator for several years, and as an

      14      educator who has worked in several capacities,

      15      I have never witnessed the devastating effects that

      16      heroin has had on a school and a school community as

      17      I have over the past few years.

      18             I shudder and fear at the thought of losing

      19      one more child.

      20             I ask all of us to stop and think, if that

      21      child was your son, daughter, granddaughter,

      22      grandson, niece, or nephew, what would you expect

      23      these changes, and what would be warranted, to stop

      24      this epidemic?

      25             This epidemic does not discriminate.







                                                                   114
       1      Everyone is vulnerable to it.

       2             All of these children are mine, and I take

       3      that to heart, and I am at the place of the cold,

       4      hard truth that I do not have, I can't provide, the

       5      resources needed to save them alone.

       6             Our system and resources are at capacity.

       7             My children, my students, our collective

       8      futures, depend on significant changes being made

       9      regarding allocations of resources and funding to

      10      truly eradicate this epidemic.

      11             Thank you.

      12                  [Applause.]

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Kelly, and for

      14      the work that you've been doing.

      15             You've been, certainly, at the front lines in

      16      recent months on this, and I do thank you for being

      17      here participating in this forum this evening.

      18             Mr. Phillips.

      19             SUPT. TOM PHILLIPS:  Thank you,

      20      Senator O'Mara, Assemblyman Palmesano, and members

      21      of the Joint Senate Task Force on Heroin and Opioid

      22      Addiction, for hosting the public hearing and

      23      soliciting input relating to stemming this crisis.

      24             I'd like to start by recounting my attendance

      25      at the New York State Physical Education, Health,







                                                                   115
       1      Recreation, and Dance Conference this past November.

       2             I attended several workshops; however,

       3      I never believed in my most vivid imagination that

       4      I would leave that conference as a trained responder

       5      in opioid-overdose prevention, including the use of

       6      intranasal Narcan.

       7             While I applaud the association for taking

       8      the initiative to train attendees, the reality that,

       9      as an educator, I would need this training was

      10      sobering.

      11             This clearly speaks to the scope of the

      12      epidemic we are facing.

      13             As to the specific questions, my answers to

      14      both of these questions focus on the need for a

      15      community approach to addressing this epidemic.

      16             Remember this, rural schools in

      17      Upstate New York often do not have a YMCA, a YWCA,

      18      or a Boys & Girls Club.

      19             We don't know what they are.

      20             As I've learned through the process of

      21      developing community-based school programming,

      22      there's not one agency or institution in any

      23      community that can address this epidemic alone.

      24             This will require collaboration, sharing of

      25      information and ideas, as well as shared







                                                                   116
       1      responsibility for quality implementation of

       2      community programming.

       3             First, one cannot focus only on the results

       4      of heroin and opioid abuse.

       5             The real question is, how do we prevent this

       6      from happening?

       7             My experience tells me we need to create a

       8      sense of community, and develop what I refer to as a

       9      "surround and support climate" that is inclusive.

      10             The community-school approach, or a similar

      11      model, provides support for academic assistance and

      12      enrichment, wellness activity, addresses child-care

      13      issues, family-support centers, summer programming,

      14      as well as quality before- and after-school

      15      activities for our children.

      16             Additionally, let me say, some of the best

      17      money ever spent by the State of New York was the

      18      School Resource Officer program.

      19                  [Applause.]

      20             SUPT. TOM PHILLIPS:  We must break down the

      21      silos of mental health, children and family

      22      services, our court system, health-care systems, and

      23      any other governmental agency or community-service

      24      provider, in addition to the regulations that

      25      prohibit information sharing.







                                                                   117
       1             I understand the right to privacy, per HIPPA,

       2      for individuals, but when the right prohibits or

       3      delays meaningful, collaborative intervention for

       4      individuals or a family, the consequences can be

       5      disastrous.

       6             Funding:

       7             This does not necessarily mean additional

       8      monies.

       9             The reality is, the state and federal

      10      government spend an enormous amount of money and

      11      resources on the establishment of bureaucracies,

      12      departments, and institutions, all focused on

      13      providing assistance to family and persons in need.

      14             There is enormous duplication of services

      15      within our communities.

      16             This is a direct outcome of the barriers in

      17      place that prevent meaningful collaboration between

      18      school, community agencies, and the courts.

      19             I believe all communities would benefit from

      20      an effort to coordinate service, including

      21      resources, as a means of streamlining intervention

      22      and providing education and assistance to those in

      23      need.

      24             Additional funding:

      25             The concept of grant funding or competitive







                                                                   118
       1      funding for communities simply does not work.

       2             If the State believes the epidemic is a

       3      priority, then fund it.

       4             On a personal note, at Watkins Glen, we are

       5      already discussing what options we have for our

       6      community-based school program once the grant funds

       7      expire.

       8             This is not an effective strategy for quality

       9      program development.

      10             In closing, I would like to again thank

      11      Senator O'Mara and members of the Task Force for

      12      their commitment to addressing the heroin and opioid

      13      addiction epidemic.

      14             I believe there are two primary issues that

      15      need to be addressed:

      16             The establishment of community schools, or a

      17      similar model, in an effort to create a

      18      surround-and-support climate that includes

      19      educational support and enrichment, wellness

      20      programs, family-support centers, and the like.

      21             When children and families feel a sense of

      22      belonging, they are more likely to be productive and

      23      willing to seek intervention when needed.

      24             Finally, appropriate levels of funding for

      25      such community centers, whether through a more







                                                                   119
       1      coordinated effort of existing resources or the

       2      elimination of non-competitive -- competitive and

       3      non-competitive grant funding.

       4             If we are serious about addressing this

       5      issue, we need to provide the funding, inclusive of

       6      sustainability options for programs once they are

       7      established.

       8             Again, thank you for asking us for our input.

       9                  [Applause.]

      10             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Tommy, for that.

      11             Now we're going to stretch our neck back over

      12      to the left here for us up here, so we'll go back to

      13      Panel III, which consists of:

      14             Danielle Tilden from the Finger Lakes

      15      Addictions Counseling Referral Agency;

      16             And, Marie Flanagan of the Yates Substance

      17      Abuse Coalition;

      18             Mike Ballard, the Council on Alcoholism and

      19      Addictions of the Finger Lakes.

      20             Danielle, would you like to start?

      21             DANIELLE TILDEN, CASAC:  Certainly.

      22             Thank you for having me tonight.

      23             On behalf of FLACRA, we have identified the

      24      following needs for funding and regulation waiver,

      25      and I'll just keep it short and sweet, because many







                                                                   120
       1      people have already said many of these ideas.

       2             The first is an increase in or additional

       3      funding for supportive living and housing

       4      opportunities within Schuyler and Yates counties.

       5             We are working towards supportive-living

       6      beds; however, you know, there's always a struggle

       7      to get the funding and the availability of

       8      appropriate housing and beds in our communities.

       9             An increase in and an availability of

      10      Suboxone or buprenorphine therapy for opioid-use

      11      disorder through the extension of waiver to nurse

      12      practitioners and physicians' assistants.

      13             M.D.s are currently the only ones who are

      14      available to get the waiver and prescribe Suboxone,

      15      and there are caps on the number of individuals who

      16      can be on their caseload: 30 individuals per doctor

      17      in the first year, 100 individuals on -- at a time

      18      on their caseload in subsequent years.

      19             This means that they can prescribe as many

      20      opiates as are deemed necessary, but, if somebody is

      21      struggling with dependence or substance-use disorder

      22      related to the opiates, the treatment -- one of the

      23      treatment options for that, Suboxone therapy, is not

      24      available to them if there's not a doctor available.

      25             Vivitrol is an excellent alternative to this







                                                                   121
       1      as well; however, there are some insurance issues

       2      with that, as well as some contraindications,

       3      especially for persons with active hepatitis, which

       4      often goes hand-in-hand with IV drug use.

       5             Increase in or additional funding for

       6      medically-supervised outpatient detoxification

       7      programs, programs with easement of regulations

       8      around this treatment type in order to ease

       9      implementation in our communities.

      10             There's little to no access to these services

      11      in our community.  And when we look to get people

      12      into services, there is typically a significant wait

      13      time for those.

      14             And as people have said, if you want

      15      treatment, if you need treatment, it needs to be at

      16      the point when you're ready to accept it.  You can't

      17      be waiting six, eight days for detox.

      18             It just doesn't -- it doesn't, typically,

      19      have positive outcomes.

      20             Increased funding for and early intervention

      21      services to allow for the identification and

      22      treatment of childhood disorders, such as ADHD,

      23      things like functional language delays, and other

      24      issues that affect our, you know, very young

      25      children.







                                                                   122
       1             Research continues to demonstrate a

       2      connection between the childhood disorders and

       3      subsequent risk for the development of substance-use

       4      disorders in adolescents and adulthood.

       5             And an increased support and funding for

       6      Narcan training kits and refills on the medication.

       7             Currently, there are some grants and

       8      easements available; however, we'd like to ensure

       9      continued, reasonable, and affordable access to

      10      Narcan for all who need it and their families.

      11             We appreciate the opportunity to share our

      12      needs and our concerns for the community, and we

      13      look forward to working together for the future in

      14      this, and getting treatment to all those who need it

      15      in a timely manner.

      16             Thank you.

      17                  [Applause.]

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Danielle.

      19             Next, Annmarie.

      20             ANNMARIE F. FLANAGAN, FNP, MS:  Thank you.

      21             I am also a nurse practitioner and I work in

      22      primary care, and I did talk with some of my

      23      patients that have substance-abuse disorders and

      24      heroin issues, and they want -- there are a couple

      25      of things that they wanted you to hear.







                                                                   123
       1             The main thing is that, they don't choose to

       2      be an addict.  The addiction chooses them.  And they

       3      don't want to be in the position that they are.

       4             They do support legislation that would allow

       5      drug dealers to be charged with homicide if they

       6      sell drugs to an individual who dies as a result of

       7      an overdose.

       8             So that's I think important for you all to

       9      hear.

      10             Health-care providers are also frustrated

      11      with trying to treat patients with substance-abuse

      12      disorders.  And we are looking for more education,

      13      at any point in time, to be able to help us be able

      14      to care for these patients better, and look for

      15      evidenced-based practice treatment plans that would

      16      benefit them.

      17             But, a few things, and I've cut this

      18      significantly shorter.

      19             But, providing parity of access to services

      20      for all residents with mental-health and

      21      substance-abuse disorders in New York State,

      22      especially in the rural areas.

      23             As you all know, that there is a significant

      24      lack in the rural areas for people to be able to

      25      access services, especially for mental-health







                                                                   124
       1      disorders.  And substance abuse is a mental-health

       2      disorder, and we do need to destigmatize that out

       3      there.

       4             Increased transparency of services,

       5      decreasing barriers, and, as Danielle did say,

       6      working with our DEA to allow nurse practitioners

       7      and physicians' assistants to be able to prescribe

       8      Suboxone.

       9             This will work -- this will allow a broader

      10      network of rural health-care professionals to

      11      provide this important and effective treatment

      12      option in rural areas.

      13             And at this point in time my patients are

      14      buying that off the street, which, if they could get

      15      it from me, we would be much safer than buying

      16      something off the street that could potentially be

      17      laced with something else.

      18             Instituting a reporting system at the local

      19      and state level to capture statistical data for

      20      substance abuse to support systematic planning and

      21      treatment.

      22             Thank you.

      23                  [Applause.]

      24             SENATOR AMEDORE:  Thank you.

      25             Annmarie, actually, what you were referring







                                                                   125
       1      to, with going after the dealers, we have in the

       2      State Senate, I sponsored a bill, it's called

       3      "Laurie's Law," that does exactly that.

       4             It goes after the drug dealers, mid- and

       5      upper-level drug dealers, who are connected to the

       6      death of an overdose of heroin, and that the

       7      law-enforcement agency can then go and charge that

       8      dealer with homicide.

       9             We got to get it through the Senate --

      10      through the Assembly, but we're working on it.

      11             And, also, you mentioned something, I think

      12      your last point that you mentioned was...?

      13             ANNMARIE F. FLANAGAN, FNP, MS:  The reporting

      14      system?

      15             SENATOR AMEDORE:  ...the reporting system.

      16             With the sale of over-the-counter of Narcan,

      17      naloxone, one of our fears, and that the Task Force

      18      has, that we have a piece of legislation that we're

      19      actually trying to work it within the budget

      20      language, is to have DOH have a database, implement

      21      a database, so that we are tracking how many kits

      22      are going over-the-counter, as well as every time

      23      it's being administered, it will be mandatory

      24      reporting.

      25             Keep in mind, we are not looking for the name







                                                                   126
       1      and the address of individuals.  We're very

       2      sensitive to that, because we do not -- we already

       3      know about the stigma.

       4             But we want to make sure, we want to gather

       5      the statistical information, so that we can pinpoint

       6      exactly where resources need to be, where the

       7      problematic areas are throughout the state.  And

       8      that will help get us down that road of more

       9      database statistical data so that we can use it.

      10             ANNMARIE F. FLANAGAN, FNP, MS:  Thank you.

      11             You're on the right track there.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Annmarie.

      13             Mike.

      14             MIKE BALLARD, MS:  Thank you.

      15             Thank you for having me tonight.

      16             The primary objective of the council is to

      17      provide education and prevention strategies to our

      18      counties, the communities, and the coalitions that

      19      we serve.

      20             I work in 5 different counties in about

      21      15 different coalitions on many of the same issues

      22      here, so I see a lot of these in every one of the

      23      counties.

      24             One of the beliefs that we have is through

      25      the efforts -- you know, these efforts that we can







                                                                   127
       1      reach families, youth, and the community members,

       2      and we can provide them with the capacity to make

       3      informed decisions about substance use and abuse.

       4             One of the programs that we have recently

       5      started to implement in Ontario County, actually, is

       6      a community-based -- or, school-based education

       7      program.

       8             We have a contract with eight of the school

       9      districts in the county, and we have educators that

      10      are in each one of those school districts

      11      full-time -- or, close to full-time, anyway, to

      12      provide education directly in the school, so they

      13      integrate themselves into those programs.

      14             That's one of the programs that we would

      15      really like to see, you know, some increased

      16      funding, to be able to provide to not only

      17      Yates County, but a larger percentage of the

      18      county -- or, the schools within our catch-basin, if

      19      you will.

      20             The program is seeing some really increased

      21      needs.

      22             We've had a lot of requests from schools, you

      23      know, for more programming, for more of the forums

      24      that we've done, all kinds of different programming,

      25      not just for heroin, but all kinds of substance







                                                                   128
       1      uses.

       2             So, that's one of the programs that we would

       3      really like to see, you know, increased.

       4             Family education is also very important at

       5      the council.

       6             Not only reaching these kids at a young age,

       7      but also being able to provide families with the

       8      resources, the education that they need, to be able

       9      to make informed decisions as family members, so

      10      that they understand the importance of, you know,

      11      seeking help as a family.

      12             And the last piece that the council would

      13      like to talk about is the lack of opiate-specific

      14      treatments within our region.

      15             There are some options, but finding treatment

      16      that is dedicated to opiate use has been very

      17      difficult.

      18             Helping provide access and access to

      19      appropriate treatments is a vital part of the

      20      recovery process.

      21             So, the Yates County community, and the

      22      region as a whole, has seen detrimental effects that

      23      substance abuse can have on their users, their

      24      families, their children, and the community as a

      25      whole.







                                                                   129
       1             Reaching our youth at an early age and

       2      educating the family members is something that we

       3      see is a tremendously important piece to helping

       4      people protect themselves and make better and more

       5      informed decisions.

       6             So I'd like to thank the Task Force, as well

       7      as everyone who came out tonight, to help us push

       8      some of this forward.

       9             So, thank you.

      10                  [Applause.]

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      12             And thank you to the panel for participating

      13      tonight.

      14             We'll get to our final panel here, but that's

      15      not going to be the end of the night.

      16             I know we're running on here.

      17             But we have our Yates County Public Health

      18      Department representatives here.

      19             And then when we finish with Deb and George,

      20      we're going to give an opportunity for my colleagues

      21      to speak or ask questions of anybody, from what

      22      we've heard.

      23             I don't let them speak at the beginning, so

      24      when it gets later they tend to speak shorter, and

      25      they're politicians, so that helps in that regard.







                                                                   130
       1             And then after that, we do want to open it up

       2      for questions from the audience.

       3             We have a microphone up here.

       4             We're going to ask anybody that wants to

       5      speak on whatever aspect of this, whatsoever, to

       6      come up to the microphone and state who you are and

       7      where you're from, and give a brief outline of the

       8      points you would like to make.

       9             And depending on how long that line gets will

      10      depend on how long I'll let you speak.

      11             But, with that, we'll move on to our final

      12      panel here, and thank you for being here, and your

      13      patience here to go last, to kind of round this out,

      14      with the Yates County Public Health Department

      15      Director Deb Minor, and the director of community

      16      services, George Roets.

      17             Deb, if you'd like to start out, and give us

      18      your perspectives here on putting this all together

      19      for us here in Yates County.

      20             DIR. DEB MINOR:  Thank you.

      21             Thank you, Senator O'Mara and Task Force

      22      members, and audience.

      23             And, being the next-to-the-last speaker,

      24      I will be very brief, and I'm going to just

      25      highlight, so I hope it doesn't sound too chopped







                                                                   131
       1      up, and I hope it makes sense.

       2             First, I want to note that we do appreciate

       3      the Governor and the State Legislature's efforts in

       4      making heroin and opiate a top public-safety,

       5      public-health, and mental-health priority in 2016.

       6             And we know that the Governor has put mention

       7      of this in the executive budget.

       8             Across New York State, many of the

       9      law-enforcement offices and public-health

      10      departments have been working to implement the

      11      opioid-overdose prevention programs, the Narcan kits

      12      and training.

      13             Since we started that program in the fall of

      14      2014, we have trained over 200 law enforcement and

      15      community members, and we have you distributed over

      16      700 kits in Yates County.

      17             This is not a measure that's going to prevent

      18      our problem, but it helps to give that addicted

      19      individual and his or her family an additional

      20      opportunity to seek treatment and work towards

      21      recovery.

      22             So even though we now can access the naloxone

      23      at the pharmacies, I would ask that you not cut the

      24      funding to that program.

      25             I think it's crucial that we at Public Health







                                                                   132
       1      and the other opiate-prevention programs have the

       2      opportunity to train folks on how to properly use

       3      this.  And it also gives us another opportunity to

       4      give them some information about recovery and

       5      treatment resources.

       6             We have heard from many of the folks on the

       7      panel tonight, and we've also heard from our forums,

       8      about the barriers that the families and the

       9      individuals suffering from addictions have in

      10      dealing with the insurance companies.

      11             So, again, we applaud the efforts of the

      12      Legislature in what they are doing to no longer

      13      permit insurance companies to require a fail-first

      14      policy.

      15             We need to stick to that, we need to hold

      16      them to that.

      17             And, so, we do ask for your commitment that

      18      that will take place.

      19             And we also are appreciative of the new

      20      realtime online tool for families and providers,

      21      that they can access at the OASAS website, in

      22      locating inpatient- and residential-treatment beds.

      23             However, anybody who looks at that will see

      24      that the capacity is not sufficient.

      25             I have seen mentioned that the executive







                                                                   133
       1      budget proposes $7 million in new funding, and

       2      proposes 300 new treatment beds to be developed over

       3      the next two years.

       4             This is good news for the state, but please

       5      make sure that some of these beds are coming to the

       6      Finger Lakes area.

       7             They cannot all go downstate and to the

       8      metropolitan areas.  It needs to be fairly

       9      distributed.

      10             I just don't want to be too choppy here, but

      11      I'm trying to be brief.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  Take your time.

      13             DIR. DEB MINOR:  At Public Health, we are

      14      also asking for continued movement towards the

      15      integration of outpatient drug treatment into the

      16      more traditional medically-focused health-care

      17      settings.

      18             We need to have comprehensive treatment plans

      19      for our patients which address the

      20      medically-assisted treatment, behavioral counseling,

      21      identification and treatment of infectious disease.

      22             We know that the use of heroin and other

      23      injectable drugs brings risk for HIV and

      24      hepatitis C.

      25             We need screening for comorbid psychiatric







                                                                   134
       1      diagnosis, as well as care of their medical needs.

       2             So we do need to have this as an integrated

       3      approach, and not be sending patients to multiple

       4      different locations to receive their treatment.

       5             Those in recovery have spoken to us of the

       6      increased social acceptability of using heroin by

       7      their -- by the youth and young adults, and of the

       8      increased availability.

       9             Parents have asked us for assistance in

      10      understanding how they can best prevent their

      11      children from making choices that lead to addiction.

      12             We know that the issue of addiction cannot be

      13      effectively addressed through treatment alone or

      14      through the arrest of those who are selling or using

      15      illegal products.

      16             We must focus a portion of our resources on

      17      prevention.

      18             And I would bring your attention to programs

      19      that are evidenced-based and proven strategies, such

      20      as Healthy Families New York and the Nurse-Family

      21      Partnership, Parents as Teachers, and the

      22      Parent-Child Home Program.

      23             I would ask that funding not be diverted from

      24      these programs.  We need to have these programs to

      25      continue to help our families.







                                                                   135
       1             But we also need to look for expansion of

       2      programs that move beyond the pre-school years.

       3             We have to find ways to help our families to

       4      parent and to have those difficult conversations

       5      with their children, and help to prevent some of

       6      these folks from turning to use of substances.

       7             There are some new tools online through

       8      OASAS, tools such as Talk to Parent and the

       9      Kitchen Table Toolkit.

      10             We need to locate additional resources such

      11      as these.

      12             And I think I've hit all of the highlights,

      13      and you do have my written testimony.

      14             Again, I thank you for this opportunity, and

      15      I look forward to continuing to work and to address

      16      this issue.

      17             Thank you.

      18                  [Applause.]

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much, Deb.

      20             George.

      21             GEORGE ROETS:  Well, I have the auspicious

      22      position here to be the last speaker from the

      23      panels.

      24             First of all, thank you, for everyone, for

      25      hanging in there.







                                                                   136
       1             The support in this community is tremendous.

       2             I could repeat and say, ditto, about almost

       3      everything that's been said tonight.

       4             We've heard about the agony.

       5             I want to just counterbalance that with

       6      saying that the involvement of the community, with

       7      the coalition, and in efforts to really corral this

       8      epidemic, is just tremendous.

       9             This is a great community that has come out

      10      and has stood up for change, and we certainly do

      11      need change.

      12             We have a whole-world problem.

      13             From a public-health point of view, it's a

      14      community problem which requires community

      15      solutions.

      16             One of the things I want to suggest that

      17      I haven't heard -- I've heard allusions to it -- and

      18      that is we need to be able to offer you, and

      19      community members, in general, ways in which they

      20      can participate more fully, both in helping protect

      21      their children from the scourge of either mental

      22      illness or substance abuse, to help your children

      23      grow healthier, and to be stronger and more

      24      resilient.

      25             The schools play a part in that, but every







                                                                   137
       1      family and every community plays a big part in that.

       2             There are programs that are being sponsored

       3      across New York State, across the United States of

       4      America.

       5             There's two great programs that, basically,

       6      begin to do that.

       7             One is called "Mental Health First-Aid,"

       8      which is really directed at adults, to learn about

       9      substance abuse, and mental illness, and what you

      10      can do as a family member, as a partner, as a

      11      sibling, as an employer, to really help somebody you

      12      see may be having a mental-health problem, or a

      13      substance-abuse problem.

      14             It's training that can be offered to schools,

      15      offered to the community, offered to child-care

      16      organizations, and other organizations that work

      17      with adults, at all levels.  It doesn't require a

      18      college degree.

      19             But it does give skills to people, and it

      20      orients people to their role in having a healthy

      21      community.

      22             The Youth Mental Health First-Aid program is

      23      specifically focused on youth.

      24             We know that when we ask people who, in fact,

      25      are addicted, 90 percent of them say they started







                                                                   138
       1      while they were in school.

       2             Did you hear that?

       3             They started while they were in school.

       4             They're the target for us.

       5             You heard from the educators.  You've heard

       6      from other people here.

       7             Early identification, early prevention, is

       8      really a core.

       9             They can't all be in school.  They're in

      10      school a few hours.

      11             They're home and in their neighborhoods the

      12      rest of their lives.

      13             So we all need to be part of the solution.

      14             We all need to be willing to step up and

      15      learn.

      16             We all need to be willing to step up and find

      17      new ways for us to be involved, and to make a

      18      difference.

      19             And I have a lot of other things I could

      20      mention.

      21             We don't have enough treatment.

      22             We don't have the right staff.

      23             We need more prevention.

      24             We have to look at early prevention, early

      25      identification.







                                                                   139
       1             We have to look at support for those who, in

       2      fact, are addicted, to protect them, and to support

       3      them in treatment, and give them the treatment they

       4      need.  To help them change the environments, because

       5      they can't stay in the same environment as an

       6      addicted person.  They need to be able to move

       7      beyond that.

       8             So, that's where I'm going to stop.

       9             But I'm going to say that there is a role for

      10      this community, and we really have to be invested

      11      with working towards giving people the tools so that

      12      we can move this army of people who now want to see

      13      a change forward and really do something in this

      14      community.

      15             Thank you.

      16                  [Applause.]

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      18             Now I'll turn it over to the Chair of our

      19      Task Force in the Senate, Senator Terrence Murphy.

      20             SENATOR MURPHY:  First of all,

      21      Senator O'Mara, it's an honor and a privilege for

      22      the invitation to come up here.

      23             I come from Westchester County.  It's just

      24      north of New York City.

      25             This afternoon; I got in the car early, and







                                                                   140
       1      I met Senator Amedore in Albany, and him and I had

       2      traveled up to Oneonta to do a 12:00 Task Force

       3      meeting in Oneonta, and then out to here.

       4             So, it's been a long day, but well worth it,

       5      I will tell you that.

       6             To the panel of experts up here, thank you.

       7             Thank you for all you do for your community.

       8             Thank you for all you do for New York State.

       9             You folks, right down there, Arianna, Devon,

      10      to sit on this stage and give your story, you are so

      11      far ahead of it.

      12             You're doing a great, great job.

      13                  [Applause.]

      14             SENATOR MURPHY:  You keep it up.

      15             You keep it up.

      16             You should be damn proud of yourself, to be

      17      able to sit up on this stage and share with

      18      everybody.

      19             That takes courage, and it takes guts.

      20             And, Alexis, I don't even know where to

      21      start.  My heart goes out to you.

      22             You are so, so strong to be able to share

      23      that story with all of us up here.

      24             It's, just, I got the chills when you were

      25      saying.







                                                                   141
       1             I leaned over to Senator Ortt and I said,

       2      This is unbelievable.

       3             And I've been around New York State, and I've

       4      heard stories.

       5             And, this, it's pretty deep.

       6             And to be able to be here and share, I thank

       7      you.

       8             And for everybody who is sitting in the

       9      audience, it's now 9:00 at night, and, you know

      10      what?

      11             To still be here says something, to you, and

      12      how much you care about your community, and to

      13      listen to all the experts up here, because this is a

      14      team effort.

      15             None of us have all the answers right here.

      16             This is why we go around the state, and this

      17      is why we listen to everybody, to gather the

      18      information and to make educated decisions on what's

      19      the best for your community.

      20             We don't know it unless you tell us.

      21             Yes, we have the experts.

      22             Who was it, Sheriff Spike over here.

      23             You know what?

      24             You're hiding behind closed doors?

      25             No more.  The stigma has got to go.







                                                                   142
       1             This has --

       2                  [Applause.]

       3             SENATOR MURPHY:  This has no boundaries.

       4             It has no ethnicity.

       5             It has no gender.

       6             It has no religion.

       7             It will shake down really, really, really

       8      good families.

       9             And this is what communities are all about:

      10      It's to rally around and make sure we do the right

      11      thing, to care for our community, and make sure we

      12      can do the right thing.

      13             I'll leave it off with, it has been an honor

      14      and a privilege to be able to be here tonight.

      15             Whatever we could do as a panel up here, and,

      16      Senator O'Mara as your State Senator, we are behind

      17      him 1,000 percent.

      18             And you're doing a great job.

      19             And thank you for allowing me to be here

      20      tonight.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Terrence.

      22                  [Applause.]

      23             SENATOR AMEDORE:  Well, thank you,

      24      Senator O'Mara, and it is an honor to be in the

      25      58th Senate District.







                                                                   143
       1             And for you to have a -- I think a

       2      most-outspoken State Senator that really is

       3      advocating for the needs of all of the district

       4      here.

       5             I have served with Senator O'Mara in the

       6      Assembly, and now in the Senate, and, he's got your

       7      back, and he's trying very hard.

       8             To Janet and to Alexis and to Gail, you know,

       9      losing a loved one or going through the trauma and

      10      the grief that you have gone through, and, to Gail,

      11      being able to have somewhat of a victory, you have

      12      all given so many much hope.

      13             And to anyone who is going to try to limit

      14      and say that we can't is unfortunate, because the

      15      more we go around and do these Task Force meetings

      16      and have public-address meetings, the -- there's a

      17      lot of moving parts, and there's not one solution.

      18             But I got to tell you, this -- it's evolving.

      19             And where the State was, to where we are

      20      today, it has been the State Majority -- the State

      21      Senate Majority Conference that has really

      22      catapulted and thrusted so many of the ideas that

      23      the panelists have already brought up.

      24             We know that there's gaps in the system.

      25             We know that there is inefficiencies still







                                                                   144
       1      that needs to be addressed.

       2             We know that we need to go and tackle big

       3      insurance companies and get them to pay more for

       4      longer treatment.

       5             We know that we can do more on the

       6      law-enforcement side.

       7             And we struggle every day in the State Senate

       8      to, how do we work through the -- that wall

       9      sometimes that's in the State Assembly, that a lot

      10      of times blocks a lot of these great ideas and

      11      initiatives that's already been mentioned here

      12      today: reforms to laws, to policies, to funding.

      13             And we need to do -- everyone, together,

      14      collectively, needs to work together, as you are

      15      doing here, we need to work together on driving the

      16      message home to the New York State Assembly, because

      17      they have blocked a lot of great initiatives and

      18      advancements so that we could -- it could curtail or

      19      eradicate this crisis that we have.

      20             Substance abuse is a huge problem, and I'm

      21      not just narrowing in on opiate or heroin addiction,

      22      even though that was the topic tonight.

      23             But, substance abuse, and a wide spectrum of

      24      it, it grabs ahold of an individual, ahold of a

      25      family, ahold of a community, that is just







                                                                   145
       1      deteriorating the quality of life throughout the

       2      state of New York.

       3             And we need to do everything possible,

       4      collectively, to fix this.

       5             So, thank you so much.

       6             God bless you all, and I appreciate the time

       7      and your stories.

       8                  [Applause.]

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, George.

      10             Senator Rob Ortt.

      11             SENATOR ORTT:  Thank you, Senator O'Mara.

      12             I want to thank you for hosting this event.

      13             I want to thank all of you for being here

      14      tonight.

      15             And I certainly want to thank the panel, and

      16      echo the comments that have been made by my

      17      colleagues already.

      18             And, you know, I think, when you look at this

      19      panel up here, and this is my fourth or fifth

      20      hearing across the state, you will see a whole range

      21      of spectrums.

      22             You have law enforcement.

      23             You have family members.

      24             You have legislators.

      25             You have superintendents.







                                                                   146
       1             You have public-health officials.

       2             You have service agencies.

       3             And that shows you how complex, how dynamic,

       4      this issue is, but it also shows you that there is

       5      no one thing.

       6             I wish there was one thing we could do that

       7      would fix this.

       8             I wish there was one thing we could do that

       9      would save lives.

      10             But, unfortunately, there's not just one

      11      thing.

      12             We're going to have to do a lot of things,

      13      and after that, we're going to have to recalibrate

      14      and probably do a lot more things.

      15             It's not just funding.

      16             It's not just this or that.

      17             It's going to be a lot of things.

      18             It's going to have to be a comprehensive

      19      approach.

      20             And that's one of reasons why we've done

      21      these hearings across the state, is to try and get a

      22      sense from the people who live this every day, from

      23      the survivors, to the families, to law-enforcement

      24      officials, what is going to work?

      25             This has to be thought out.







                                                                   147
       1             This cannot be just a reaction.

       2             This cannot be just, I need to get in the

       3      headline tomorrow.

       4             Or this cannot be, something bad's happening

       5      so we need to do something.

       6             We need to do something, but we need to do

       7      something that works.

       8             And, you know, for these families over here,

       9      it does no good to them, and, for these guys sitting

      10      over here, who go out every day and put their lives

      11      on the line, it does no good to them, if what we're

      12      doing isn't effective, if what we're doing doesn't

      13      work, and if we don't take into account what they

      14      have to say.

      15             I wanted to specifically mention Janet.

      16             All of you gave very heartfelt and emotional

      17      stories.

      18             But Janet talked about her son, and one of

      19      the things that resonated with me was, she said he

      20      was a veteran of Iraq.

      21             And, I was a veteran of Afghanistan, and

      22      I know a lot of veterans who come out and who suffer

      23      from mental health-related issues.

      24             And as Chair of the Mental Health Committee

      25      in the Senate, I see this all the time with







                                                                   148
       1      self-medicating.  And, a lot of veterans are being

       2      struck by this very epidemic, this opioid and heroin

       3      epidemic.

       4             These are men and women who served their

       5      country in combat, who wore a uniform, who wore the

       6      flag on their shoulder, who did amazing things; and,

       7      yet, they come back, and, it's not Iraq that gets

       8      them, it's not Afghanistan, it's not ISIS or the

       9      Taliban or some insurgent.

      10             It's heroin, which I think is really tragic

      11      and ironic.

      12             And on the good side, we've started the

      13      Joseph P. Dwyer program in Niagara County.  It's a

      14      program that exists elsewhere in the state.  It's a

      15      peer-to-peer support service.

      16             And, basically, one of the things that

      17      they're going to start doing is going to the VA,

      18      working with the VA, when the veterans coming out,

      19      who have been there for heroin or drug treatment.

      20      They're going to be there to get these guys or these

      21      girls right when they come out, because that's one

      22      of the most vulnerable times, which we heard about,

      23      when they are discharged.

      24             That 48-to-72-hour time frame is when you see

      25      a lot of relapses, and, actually, a lot of deaths.







                                                                   149
       1             But I just -- I know you'll probably remember

       2      your son in a lot of different ways.

       3             I think you should remember him, certainly,

       4      as a soldier, and as a hero for the country.

       5             And, last, but not least, I'll just say that,

       6      you know, we heard a lot tonight, too, about

       7      marijuana.

       8             We heard -- I forget who it was who talked

       9      about five previous unlawful marijuana possessions.

      10             And I met a family in Niagara County whose

      11      daughter passed away late last year, and they came

      12      up to me and they told me that their daughter, who

      13      was 22 at the time, told them that this all started

      14      when she started with marijuana.

      15             And I know there's a lot of different

      16      opinions on this across the country, but all I can

      17      say is, most of these folks here whose loved ones

      18      are either recovering or are not here, I guarantee

      19      you, they didn't start with heroin.

      20             They started somewhere with something else,

      21      and that led to heroin.

      22             So, I think we have to be very realistic that

      23      it's not always a victimless crime.  That there are

      24      such things as gateway drugs, and there are such

      25      things as entry-level drugs, that lead to something







                                                                   150
       1      a lot more -- a lot more significant.

       2             And while substance abuse is very serious,

       3      this heroin epidemic is very lethal.

       4             You don't come back from this one, you know,

       5      for very long.

       6             And I think that everyone up here gets it.

       7             We're all trying -- we're trying to find a

       8      solution.

       9             But there's an ownership that's a part of

      10      this as well, and I want to thank all of you,

      11      because you're owning it.

      12             By being here tonight, you're owning it,

      13      because if you think that it doesn't happen in your

      14      community, you're wrong.

      15             If you think it doesn't happen in your

      16      family, you're wrong.

      17             And if you think that it's just going to go

      18      away by itself, you're wrong.

      19             So I want to thank you all for being here,

      20      and I want to thank my colleagues for being here as

      21      well.

      22                  [Applause.]

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Rob.

      24             Next we'll go to our colleague in the

      25      Assembly, who is, fortunate for me, to serve in my







                                                                   151
       1      Senate District, which includes Yates County,

       2      Schuyler County, Steuben County, part of

       3      Chemung County, and Seneca County, for -- Phil.

       4             But before we get to Phil, we do want to get

       5      to whoever in the audience would like to speak.

       6             So if you could move over by the microphone

       7      and line up against the wall, we'll get to you as

       8      soon as Phil is done.

       9             But, Phil.

      10             ASSEMBLYMAN PALMESANO:  Thank you for

      11      listening.

      12             Certainly, the members of panel who are up

      13      here, offering your expertise.

      14             But most importantly, the six of you at the

      15      end of the table, for having the courage to share

      16      your personal stories.

      17             You put a human face and human side to this

      18      growing epidemic that's affecting every community

      19      throughout the state.

      20             And as you heard, and as we all know, this

      21      doesn't matter what color you are, whether you're

      22      rich or poor, upstate or downstate.

      23             This issue knows no boundaries.

      24             And to have you come out and take the time to

      25      share that with all of us, should give us all







                                                                   152
       1      motivation to try to solve this problem.

       2             So, thank you again.

       3             I did just want to say, just to my colleagues

       4      here in the Senate, that -- and the members of the

       5      community, our Assembly Minority did actually have

       6      hearings around the state last fall, and we just

       7      wanted to make sure we presented that with you.

       8             You know, we think there are good ideas, a

       9      lot of that we heard about today, that, as you guys

      10      go forward, and as we look for legislation, we have

      11      some good ideas and blueprints in there to move

      12      forward, and we certainly have to act.

      13             You know, we do these forums and we get this

      14      input, but it's imperative for us to act, and it has

      15      to be a comprehensive approach, from prevention, to

      16      rehab, to detox, to recovery, to education, to help

      17      with law enforcement.

      18             And, certainly, again, we need to take the

      19      stigma off this, and treat this disease, and not be

      20      afraid to tell the insurance companies they have to

      21      be a part of the solution.

      22             But we have to do it together, it has to be a

      23      community effort.

      24             And I think the people at this table signify

      25      their commitment to make this a community effort.







                                                                   153
       1             You being here signifies that you want to be

       2      a part of this community effort to solve this

       3      problem.

       4             And we just want you to know that we want to

       5      be a part of the solution and help as much as we can

       6      as well.

       7             So, I thank you for coming out.

       8             We appreciated your testimony, and we look

       9      forward to hearing from the audience as well.

      10             So thank you very, very much for being here

      11      tonight.

      12             Appreciate it.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Phil.

      14                  [Applause.]

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  We'll begin with you at the

      16      microphone.

      17             If you could please state your name, and if

      18      you're with an organization, state that, or,

      19      otherwise, just state what your hometown is so we

      20      have an idea where you're from.

      21             And out of respect for those that are in line

      22      behind you, so that we get to everybody, please keep

      23      it to a couple minutes.

      24             And, we look forward to -- and thank you for

      25      standing up and addressing us here tonight.







                                                                   154
       1             REV. RYAN SMITH:  Hello.  My name is

       2      Reverend Ryan Smith.  I'm from Penn Yan.

       3             First of all, I'd like to thank our State

       4      Legislature for coming down to address this issue.

       5             As a clergy member, and a freshman in

       6      high school, a lot of students approach me with

       7      their problems.

       8             And, out of all the things that I've heard,

       9      drugs is one of the number-one things that I heard.

      10             And I want to stress that we need to be

      11      teaching children, our students, that we are on the

      12      front line.  We're the ones who are interacting with

      13      the kids who are doing these drugs and who are being

      14      exposed to these things.

      15             So, you know, things like Natural Helpers,

      16      and other groups, that teach students to help other

      17      students, their peers, who are struggling with this

      18      issue.

      19             I hear it all the time.

      20             And it's -- I think our students really need

      21      to step up, because we're the ones who are on the

      22      front line.

      23             We're the ones who are being -- when it comes

      24      to the schools, the number-one people who are being

      25      affected by this, our families, and are being







                                                                   155
       1      exposed to this.

       2             And so I really think students need to learn

       3      how to stand up and talk with their peers about this

       4      issue.

       5             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much.

       6                  [Applause.]

       7             CHRISTINA CLEVELAND:  Hi.

       8             I'm Christina Cleveland.

       9             I'm the mother of Miranda Cleveland.

      10             She was a 17-year-old who died unexpectedly

      11      November 9, 2015, from a heroin overdose.

      12             She was a senior at Dundee school.

      13             Her death is being treated as if she was

      14      another junky off the street.

      15             The New York State trooper that is

      16      investigating the case has made some very

      17      inappropriate comments two days after her death.

      18             He said, "There was one way off heroin, and

      19      she just took that exit."

      20             He has also made accusations, assumptions,

      21      took her character from a family that didn't know

      22      her, where she was doing the drug activity, where

      23      the OD took place, instead of her loving family of

      24      almost 18 years.

      25             He's not asked anyone.

       1             When I do call him, I've never met the man

       2      face-to-face, so I have to call him, when he decides

       3      to call me back, days, he acts as if he has no time

       4      for me.

       5             "I have a case overload.  I'm too busy."

       6             I do believe we need more, and we need more

       7      officers.

       8             I'm being treated -- I couldn't tell you the

       9      last time I even talked to him.  I can't tell you

      10      where her case is at.

      11             All I hear is, "We're waiting.  We're

      12      waiting."

      13             Thank you.

      14                  [Applause.]

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      16             Thank you very much for sharing that with us,

      17      and our heartfelt condolences for your loss.

      18             CARRIE AHEARN (ph.):  Good evening, and I

      19      invite anybody who's a note-taker to get their pen

      20      ready.

      21             I know a lot of people have tucked them away.

      22             My name is Carrie Ahern, and I am a village

      23      resident here in Penn Yan, and I have been inspired

      24      by all of the members of YSAC, whether I'm an

      25      acquaintance of theirs or a personal friend of







                                                                   157
       1      theirs.

       2             And, I just wanted to share with everybody

       3      here in our community that I am working with the

       4      Penn Yan United Methodist Church.

       5             We are going bring a program to Penn Yan

       6      called "Celebrate Recovery."

       7             This program is a crisis-center recovery

       8      group, but it is for anybody and everybody, to

       9      include addicts, but also to include people who are

      10      codependent, or if they have an anxiety behavior

      11      that they are covering and masking with an

      12      addiction, whether it's substance abuse or

      13      behavioral-based.

      14             And for more information, we're going to have

      15      a public-information meeting at the Methodist church

      16      on Sunday, March 20th, at 6:00 p.m., in their

      17      basement fellowship hall.

      18             Thank you.

      19                  [Applause.]

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      21             PAMELA FINGER (ph.):  Good evening.

      22             My name is Pamela Finger, and I'm a member of

      23      YSAC, and I've also been an educator in the

      24      New York State education system since 1993.

      25             In my 23 years in education, I've come in







                                                                   158
       1      contact with a countless amount of youth in the

       2      Steuben and Yates county areas.

       3             Lately, I've talked to several former

       4      students who are, and have been, affected by this

       5      heroin problem, and they've all told me the same

       6      thing:  We need more education past fifth grade.

       7             I'm asking that we listen to these young

       8      people, and figure out how to get more education out

       9      to all students earlier, rather than later, before

      10      it's too late, because I don't need to go to --

      11      I don't like to go to another forum and have a

      12      former student come up to me and say:  Mrs. Finger,

      13      we need help, and we need help now.

      14             Thank you.

      15                  [Applause.]

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      17             PATTY O'KELLEY (ph.):  Okay.  This is going

      18      to be the strangest of all.

      19             I've been here about two months.

      20             I grew up in Elmira as a small child.

      21             I moved, Boston, New York, Ohio, Kentucky,

      22      Florida, Georgia, Illinois, and Colorado.

      23             My mother just passed away, so I decided to

      24      come home, and this is what I call "home."

      25             I will tell you that the cities that you're







                                                                   159
       1      referring to, less than 1 percent are enjoying, if

       2      they have, a community center.

       3             So the rural isn't necessarily it.

       4             And forgive me for not thanking you all, but

       5      we all know we're out of time.

       6             You guys are doing your jobs.

       7             You guys are doing your jobs.

       8             But here's where I'm coming from, and this

       9      has been ignored for the last 2 1/2 years.

      10             There is no presidential candidate right now

      11      that's going to address any of this.

      12             We don't know whether it's going to get

      13      better or worse.

      14             The state has no money.

      15             The government has no money.

      16             The schools have no money.

      17             There's a side of this that doesn't need

      18      money.

      19             I'm thrilled that, first, two church members

      20      came up here.

      21             One of the reasons I came back to a small

      22      town is that I need a family.

      23             I am on the streets and I'm already running

      24      into people I know.

      25             Dennis, one of our superintendents, has







                                                                   160
       1      already heard my story a bit.

       2             But, a legislation or an idea or an

       3      understanding needs to pass that is free, and that

       4      is, to let the people know, who know, these -- if

       5      you can't find an NA meeting, I have news for you,

       6      you're the ones starting it.

       7             Where am I coming from?

       8             I'm from a generation back in the day.

       9             My father died of alcoholism, many of us had

      10      the same situation, but I suffered from that.  And

      11      I went to Adult Children, Women Who Love Too Much,

      12      and those -- I mean, everything out there, and

      13      I finally barged into an AA meeting and lied for

      14      17 years about not being an alcoholic.

      15             Rare, but, that group of men had the secret,

      16      and it was free.  It was a dollar in the basket for

      17      the coffee.

      18             What I'm saying is, is that if this is a

      19      small town and we have churches coming together,

      20      I have been to two of them.  I'm trying to make my

      21      way to all of them.  I heard the best words I ever

      22      heard, which one of them said, "all the churches are

      23      coming together."

      24             We need the churches.

      25             But as far as the schools and getting better







                                                                   161
       1      education, why is this gentleman not telling his

       2      story?

       3             I have a story to tell, but because I'm not

       4      all these certifications, the certified people can

       5      assist.  But if you don't use the people who have

       6      been there, done that, this mother said, "I knew

       7      nothing."

       8             Guess what?

       9             She knows what this mother may need to know

      10      tomorrow.

      11             This entire community can answer the phone

      12      when she calls and says "I need help."

      13             And we can sit there with coffee in a lobby

      14      somewhere until the help gets there, because if we

      15      just put 92 things on your desk that said, Give us

      16      money, this is a community.

      17             I have a picture in my phone, when we were

      18      this big, on this lake.

      19             We don't need $600 condos.

      20             We need some canoes.

      21             There was ten of our kids, all together,

      22      meaning our friends, and I said, No wonder we were

      23      happy.  We had ten kids, and we were all in bathing

      24      suits.

      25             I'm going to say something that's going to







                                                                   162
       1      really upset people, but please understand I am

       2      aspiring to go to University of Pennsylvania for my

       3      master's in positive psychology, which is, get these

       4      kids off of drugs, and I'm talking about the little

       5      ones.

       6             I went a middle-school band tour, and there

       7      was this many drugs for our children.

       8             It isn't the pot that got them stuck on it.

       9             It's that we did not teach them how to get

      10      over anxiety, and we didn't teach them how to get

      11      over depression, and we didn't teach them how to

      12      deal with some of these issues.

      13             I was a college recruiter for 10 years, and

      14      I had a gentleman come to tell me he was the only

      15      one in his school who had not been on Adderall.

      16             The drug laws for our children in school

      17      needs to be change now, that it's not every kid has

      18      ADD.

      19             I know the educators.  I know people --

      20                  [Applause.]

      21             PATTY O'KELLEY (ph.):  -- they come out and

      22      they are used to being given a tool to deal with

      23      what they're going through.

      24             I will give my card to all of you guys.

      25             I will give my card to you guys.







                                                                   163
       1             You guys are all doing great jobs.

       2             But the educators, let us in.

       3             Let us in who can help your kids.

       4             Why can't we -- when I was in psychology, you

       5      all heard of arachnophobia?

       6             Okay.  We studied it in a book.  We looked at

       7      it in a piece of paper.

       8             But it wasn't until we saw the video of the

       9      true guy in the corner, sweating, shaking, and

      10      vomiting, that we realized what it really was, and

      11      it isn't just, he's afraid of spiders.

      12             And it's the same with heroin.

      13             He can't come in like this and just tell

      14      kids, Don't do it, and posters and all that,

      15      nothing.

      16             But he can come in with some serious video

      17      and go back to the world of scared straight.

      18                  [Applause.]

      19             PATTY O'KELLEY (ph.):  You know, "Breaking

      20      Bad" romanced this, and I mean romanced it.

      21             That was a great show as far as dialogue.

      22             But as far as when they were laying sick and

      23      vomiting, man, you just kind of looked past that.

      24             It romanced it.

      25             But until that's the picture these kids see







                                                                   164
       1      in fifth grade, sixth grade, seventh grade,

       2      eighth grade, ninth grade, tenth grade.  It can't be

       3      an auditorium like this, because the kids are going

       4      to giggle over here.

       5             You need to get small groups and get these

       6      people in to help.

       7             But as a community, now that I am back, I'm

       8      back because it is a small town, and we need to

       9      start having some phone people that answer phones

      10      when people need.

      11             I have gone through a lot in my life,

      12      depression, all of that.  But when I pick the phone

      13      up and say "Help," I get, "Well, what did you want?

      14      Well, she can't call you back for two years."

      15             I have offered to volunteer at several

      16      places, in schools, in committees.

      17             I have not had one phone call.

      18             I have been through this, family-wise,

      19      kid-wise.

      20             I was recruiting juniors and seniors for

      21      10 years.

      22             That's why I do this, and all I did was get

      23      their heads turned around, changed their grades, and

      24      get them out of college.

      25             It doesn't take all your money that you don't







                                                                   165
       1      have, and all these things.

       2             We need the church basements.

       3             We need the auditoriums.

       4             We need some canoes, and we need some fishing

       5      poles.

       6             And we need some things to get these kids out

       7      of that depression, and we need to understand.

       8             And if you have funding to send me to U Penn

       9      for positive psychology, I'll come back and do it

      10      all.

      11             So, that's all I've got.

      12                  [Applause.]

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      14             Could you give us your name for the record,

      15      please.

      16             I'm sorry.

      17             PATTY O'KELLEY (ph.):  They all know it.

      18             Somehow they all know me.

      19             Patty O'Kelley.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Patty.

      21             STEPHANIE CAMPBELL:  Good evening.

      22             My name is Stephanie Campbell, and I'm the

      23      director of policy for Friends of Recovery New York.

      24             I just want to express my gratitude to my

      25      Senators who I've been speaking with, and having







                                                                   166
       1      conversations with, and a new Assembly friend.

       2             Thank you.  That's awesome to meet you.

       3             I also worked with the Assembly Minority on

       4      that task force, and it was fantastic, and there's

       5      some great things in it.

       6             I also, though, want to say that, my name is

       7      Stephanie Campbell and I'm a person in long-term

       8      recovery.  And what that means is --

       9                  [Applause.]

      10             STEPHANIE CAMPBELL:  Thank you.

      11             -- what that means is, I haven't used drugs

      12      or alcohol for 15 years.

      13             And what that's allowed me to do, is it's

      14      allowed me to be a mother of two beautiful children,

      15      one who turned 21 today.  It's allowed me to be a

      16      wife.  It's allowed me to be an employed person.

      17             Prior to my coming into recovery, I must have

      18      cost New York State taxpayers a couple millions of

      19      dollars, maybe.

      20             So I've saved you guys a lot of money.

      21                  [Laughter.]

      22             STEPHANIE CAMPBELL:  And, I hope that Devon

      23      and Adrianna --

      24             Is it Adrianna?

      25             -- Arianna, continue on this journey.  And,







                                                                   167
       1      let's stay connected, let's get connected.

       2             Alexis, you are amazing.  Just blew my socks

       3      off.  I'm sitting over there, going, Who is this

       4      woman?

       5             Just really powerful.

       6             And I loved what the last speaker said, "We

       7      know recovery."

       8             And, you know, we know the problem of

       9      addiction.

      10             It's horrible.

      11             It's horrific.

      12             It's not just heroin.

      13             That's the drug du jour right now.

      14             But it was crack in the '80s.  And the

      15      Rockefeller drug laws did not make that situation

      16      better, I'm sorry to say.

      17             What I can say to you is that, as a person in

      18      long-term recovery, I know that, you know, I'm an

      19      expert in this field, because I'm doing it, because

      20      I have battled addiction, and because, you know, I'm

      21      here as living proof that recovery works.

      22             And, so, in the conversation that we've been

      23      having, you know, which is incredible, that we're

      24      now talking about we can't incarcerate our way out

      25      of this.  Right?







                                                                   168
       1             We need treatment.

       2             We need education.

       3             We need prevention.

       4             But we need recovery.

       5             Someone comes out of crisis and they leave

       6      treatment, and they go back into a drug-infested

       7      housing project, you know, a system which offers no

       8      supports, there's no recovery community

       9      organization, there's no recovery community centers,

      10      there's no recovery coaches, there's no family

      11      navigators.

      12             We're setting them up to fail, and we have to

      13      stop doing that, and we do have to invest in the

      14      solution of recovery.

      15             So, I just want to, you know, reiterate, last

      16      month in Buffalo there were 23 overdoses, in one

      17      month.

      18             It's not getting any better, and we know

      19      that.

      20             But there is a solution, and we're calling on

      21      our representatives in the Legislature to put more

      22      money.

      23             We're asking for $50 million.

      24             That's a drop in the bucket.

      25             We need $50 million for recovery supports in







                                                                   169
       1      the community, so that we can do recovery, so that

       2      don't have to go and visit our friends over here, so

       3      they don't have to wreak havoc and tornado through

       4      life, and possibly die, and leave their children,

       5      you know, parentless.

       6             So we do ask that this disease of addiction

       7      is treated as a chronic illness, not as a moral

       8      deficiency.

       9             And we need that funding now.

      10             Thank you.

      11                  [Applause.]

      12             YANA KHASHPER:  Hi, good evening.

      13             I'm a little short.

      14             My name is Yana Khashper, and I'm the

      15      co-founder of ROCovery Fitness.  We're a brand new

      16      nonprofit here in Rochester.

      17             And I just want to say, thank you, to all the

      18      panelists, all the people who spoke, the room full

      19      of people that are here to talk about recovery, talk

      20      about addiction and recovery.

      21             I'm also a licensed clinical social worker,

      22      and I've been working in the field for about a

      23      decade.

      24             I received a graduate degree from NYU, and

      25      I had a 4.0 in the height of my addiction.







                                                                   170
       1             I was not dumb.  I was not lacking willpower.

       2             I had a chronic disease, and that chronic

       3      disease took everything from me.

       4             But I'm here to tell that you recovery is

       5      possible.

       6             As Stephanie mentioned, we know what the

       7      problem is.

       8             You don't need me to tell you what the

       9      problem is.

      10             We don't need all you folks to tell us what

      11      the problem is.

      12             We can look in the news, we can see all the

      13      deaths.

      14             You know, and -- I'm a little nervous.

      15             And like Stephanie mentioned, we have a

      16      solution, a solution that we've seen work.

      17             The Rockefeller drug laws that targeted

      18      low-level criminals with mandatory minimums probably

      19      didn't take away the money from the schools, and

      20      they're probably not the solution that we have

      21      today.

      22             The problem that we have today is a chronic

      23      illness, which is addiction.

      24             And a lot of folks talked about cancer being

      25      a chronic illness.







                                                                   171
       1             I don't know about you guys, but I haven't

       2      seen anyone get sick from cancer, and people look at

       3      them and say, Oh, your vomit is repulsive.

       4             But I've seen people go through withdrawal

       5      and have that same reaction.

       6             And that is the problem that we face.

       7             As Stephanie talked about, we need more

       8      money.

       9             We need more money for services.

      10             Absolutely, we need more supports.

      11             The Rochester-area detox generally has

      12      100-person wait list.

      13             Think about that.

      14             100-person wait list in Rochester, New York.

      15             That is unacceptable.

      16             We could increase incarceration stays.

      17             We could increase substance abuse --

      18      substance-program stays.  They would have a benefit.

      19             But you leave these people and drop them

      20      right back into those communities, and then what?

      21             You set them up to fail.

      22             What we're asking for is recovery community

      23      organization.  Peer-support programs.

      24             What ROCovery Fitness is, is a nonprofit in

      25      Rochester, based around sober peers committed to







                                                                   172
       1      leading physically-active lifestyles.

       2             We have a live network of supports.

       3             The Gloucester department, the ANGELS they

       4      talk about, the recovery coaches, that's what we

       5      need money for.

       6             The treatment services, absolutely, all that

       7      stuff is important, but we have a low-cost

       8      alternative to death: peer support.

       9             Our programs cost nothing.

      10             Our average hikes yield about 40 people in

      11      recovery.

      12             We have touched over 500 individuals since

      13      inception in September.

      14             Those are some big numbers.

      15             And we need your help.

      16             We need your help to reach more people.

      17             There needs to be an atmosphere of recovery,

      18      and there needs to be less stigma.  We need to

      19      shatter that stigma.

      20             And that's what ROCovery Fitness aims to do.

      21             We have three initiatives under ROCovery.

      22             One is the community of sober peers that help

      23      and guide one another.

      24             Another is the outreach.  We talk to

      25      treatment centers.  We talk to anyone that will







                                                                   173
       1      listen, parole, probation.

       2             And the last one is education.

       3             To get into the schools, give them

       4      presentations, talk about recovery, talk about what

       5      it looks like; not just say, Stop using drugs and

       6      alcohol, and here you go, live freely.

       7             It talks about what you do when you stop

       8      using drugs and alcohol.

       9             And that's really the miracle of this.

      10             I lost my entire life to addiction, and

      11      I gained it back in recovery, and I live a life

      12      beyond my wildest dreams.

      13             And that's possible.

      14             And that's the atmosphere we need to put out

      15      there:  Recovery is possible.

      16             Thank you so much for having me up here.

      17             Sorry I took your time.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      19                  [Applause.]

      20             JIM OHBROSKI (ph.):  Hi.  My name is

      21      Jim Ohbroski (ph.).

      22             I'm a New York State taxpayer, and a common

      23      citizen.

      24             I just look at things pragmatically.

      25             First, what really irks me are dealers







                                                                   174
       1      themselves and the sociopathic nature they have.

       2      They don't care about anybody.

       3             And what I find interesting, there are

       4      avenues, is to take the profit out of drug

       5      trafficking.

       6             And I also question, just to bring up the

       7      aspect of Afghanistan, which supplies 60 percent of

       8      America's heroin now, three times what it did back

       9      before 9/11, and, where is the federal role in this?

      10             You know, if we don't have the substance, we

      11      can't start the addiction.

      12             And I know it's a long process, and I know

      13      there's many factors, and I won't address that.

      14             And the other thing is, Tom Brokaw wrote a

      15      book called "The Greatest Generation."

      16             I think we've lost that.

      17             And I think that one of the root causes of

      18      addiction and the crisis problems we have is, we've

      19      kind of lost hope.  Is the American Dream there

      20      anymore?

      21             If I were 18 years old today, I'd be scared.

      22             I started out as an electrician, and 30 years

      23      ago, I would make as much as I do today; and, yet,

      24      the price of a car has escalated six to eight times

      25      that.  The cost of a house is out of reach.







                                                                   175
       1             All the things that I was brought up on, I'm

       2      a second-generation American.  My grandparents came

       3      from Europe, they were poor.

       4             I actually went back to the areas they were,

       5      and people don't realize they're still driving

       6      oxcarts in Russia.

       7             That's part of family.

       8             They're still doing that today.

       9             And they came, my grandparents came, and he--

      10      and he was in this country, what, eight years, and

      11      he owned a house, he owned property.

      12             That was unheard of in Europe.

      13             Unheard of.

      14             But where is that today for an 18-year-old?

      15             What does an 18-year-old -- I think Devon,

      16      what he talked about, and I'm saying, Would I be

      17      disillusioned?

      18             Would I seek another thing that would make me

      19      feel good?

      20             You know, cost of education is outrageous.

      21             I could go -- in my time, I could go to

      22      Rutgers, which was an Ivy League school, for $400 a

      23      semester.

      24             That's out of the question for a community

      25      college today.







                                                                   176
       1             So I look at root causes, and ask you people,

       2      and the people who have gone through the experience

       3      of seeking some other source:  Is there a future for

       4      the American youth today?

       5             And with the universality of labor, China,

       6      other jobs, I'm not blaming other countries.  It's

       7      just an evolution process.  We're becoming more

       8      global.  Political borders are going to change,

       9      geographic borders are going to change.

      10             They're going to become economic borders in

      11      the near future, and I say within 20 years.

      12             Our whole system is going through a massive

      13      change, and we need to factor that in.

      14             And where drugs fits in, is fulfilling some

      15      kind of need that we can't get, that we would rather

      16      have, like having a home, having security, things

      17      that today just are not present.

      18             And I'm not blaming anybody.

      19             I think it's an evolution process, as well as

      20      other things.

      21             And we need to factor that in.

      22             What is the hope for the future in this

      23      country?

      24             Thank you.

      25                  [Applause.]

       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

       2             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Good evening.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Good evening.

       4             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  I'm

       5      Michael Christiansen (ph.), lifelong resident here

       6      in the village of Penn Yan.

       7             Before I get into a lot of my background,

       8      I have a question.

       9             I've seen -- or, I've heard tonight a lot of

      10      reference to funding.

      11             And one issue that came to light weeks ago to

      12      me, in the media, I saw it once, and I haven't seen

      13      it since, and I don't know if it's true or not,

      14      especially seeing as how I got it from the media.

      15             But, I was with the Sheriff's Office, worked

      16      with Sheriff Spike for 31 years.  We were in the

      17      back of a beat-up old green vans down on Route 14,

      18      stumbling around back in the day.

      19             But, in the mid-'80s, a program was

      20      initiated, where the federal government would

      21      sponsor a seizure if you had a defendant, whether

      22      they had a vehicle, whether they had a residence,

      23      that the federal government, as long as local law

      24      enforcement did the paperwork, proved their case,

      25      and took it to the U.S. Attorney up in Rochester,







                                                                   178
       1      they would pursue a seizure for the funds that these

       2      drug dealers.

       3             And we've talked about funding today, we've

       4      heard increased funding enough times, so I'm trying

       5      to get to the crux of things here.

       6             But it was a great program, wherein the

       7      U.S. Attorney's Office would handle the seizure

       8      of -- it could be a home, it could be a car, it

       9      could be the cash money that was taken during the

      10      arrest.  And for 20 percent of the net, they would

      11      handle it, and local law enforcement got the other

      12      80 percent, and it had to be used for increased drug

      13      enforcement, drug programs, anything involved in the

      14      drug issue.

      15             And it's my understanding now, and I'm not

      16      pointing the finger at you gentlemen, because it's

      17      my understanding that it's at the national level,

      18      the U.S. Department of Justice, and I heard the

      19      reference earlier today that this is a nationwide

      20      crisis, which, if anybody reads the paper, you

      21      recognized that this heroin issue is not just in

      22      Yates County.

      23             So, anyways, my question is:  Is that true?

      24             Has that program been nixed?

      25             And who's is responsible for that?







                                                                   179
       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yeah, there has been a

       2      recent change in that.

       3             I would defer to the table over here on the

       4      specifics of that.

       5             SHERIFF RONALD G. SPIKE:  Yeah, the

       6      U.S. Department of Justice has put an end to that

       7      program.

       8             If you remember the DAG 71 form?

       9             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Yes, I do.

      10             SHERIFF RONALD G. SPIKE:  No longer available

      11      to us, and they've stopped it.

      12             So any asset forfeiture through the feds,

      13      through the DEA, is stopped.

      14             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Now, who made

      15      that decision?

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Not us.

      17             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  I know you

      18      didn't.

      19                  [Laughter.]

      20             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  I prefaced my

      21      question with that.  I know you guys didn't.

      22             But is that the Obama Administration?

      23             SENATOR ORTT:  Former-U.S. Attorney

      24      Eric Holder.

      25             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Eric Holder.







                                                                   180
       1             And who does he get his marching orders from?

       2             I'm not trying to --

       3             SENATOR ORTT:  Well, today, probably just

       4      Mrs. Holder.

       5             But back in the day, it was President Obama.

       6             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Okay.  And I'm

       7      not politicizing things, but if anybody, and I defer

       8      to the sheriffs here and the District Attorney's

       9      Office, and Judge Falvey, who was a former district

      10      attorney, I believe, back in the '80s when we were

      11      dealing with this, that that program initiated a lot

      12      of money.

      13             And all I've heard today from everybody here

      14      is increased funding.

      15             And there is -- it's gone out the window.

      16             This week, up in Rochester, 18 pounds of

      17      cocaine.

      18             Now, those of you that aren't involved in

      19      drug enforcement might not recognize, that's a lot

      20      of coke.  300-and-some-odd-thousand dollars, a BMW.

      21             And now that's not getting seized?

      22             And all I heard about tonight is how much

      23      more money we need.

      24             I implore on our political leaders to get to

      25      the bottom of that issue and put a hammer on.







                                                                   181
       1             With this epidemic, and that's what it's been

       2      referred to here today, a national crisis, an

       3      epidemic, that we need more funding.

       4             There it is.

       5             There it is, and it's just gone up in smoke

       6      in the last week.

       7             And how many here tonight had heard about

       8      that?

       9             Not a lot.

      10             Never.

      11             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  If I could just

      12      address that over here.

      13             Valerie.

      14             Woo-hoo.

      15             Hi.

      16             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Hi.

      17             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  While there are some

      18      serious restrictions for the federal forfeiture

      19      procedures, they are still available, in a very

      20      limited way, if the federal prosecution started as a

      21      federal investigation.

      22             What we do have, though, available through

      23      our state law and our state seizure asset-forfeiture

      24      provisions, is the ability to -- and we've done this

      25      over the last two years, it's one of the things that







                                                                   182
       1      I've instituted -- is done some asset forfeiture.

       2      So you're looking at vehicles, some cash, and that

       3      gets disbursed to, a percentage to the

       4      law-enforcement agency, a percentage to OASAS, which

       5      is the state substance-abuse agencies, and a smaller

       6      percent to the DA's Office.  And that gets used

       7      specifically to fund law enforcement-related

       8      activities, such as training, et cetera.

       9             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Right, and I --

      10             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  So those funds, by

      11      statute, it's very strictly regulated as to what we

      12      can spend that kind of money on.

      13             But make no mistake, I mean, we're really not

      14      seeing -- the primary dealing that you're talking

      15      about, where people have bundles of cash, isn't

      16      really happening here.

      17             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Right, but

      18      there's still vehicles and there's still homes.

      19             And I'm familiar with the program that you're

      20      talking about at the state level.

      21             Unfortunately, the State, they got such a

      22      huge hunk of the pie, that there's none for local

      23      law enforcement.

      24             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  It's over 40 percent

      25      that goes to OASAS.







                                                                   183
       1             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Exactly.

       2             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  It's almost

       3      30 percent that goes to the local law enforcement

       4      agency --

       5             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  30 percent.

       6             DA VALERIE G. GARDNER:  -- and the rest into

       7      the DA's Office to go on law enforcement.

       8             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Right, and

       9      that's my concern.

      10             With this federal program, 80 percent went

      11      back to local law enforcement, and the feds kept

      12      20 percent for their problem.

      13             And now that's gone.

      14             So that question being answered, I also have

      15      to reflect on my experiences, as I mentioned

      16      earlier, with Sheriff Spike, I go back 30-plus

      17      years, and was actively involved in drug

      18      enforcement.

      19             And, I don't have to tell a lot of people,

      20      here, but you would think that this is something new

      21      after what you've heard tonight.

      22             This has been going on for a while.

      23             And, I keep hearing, once again, increased

      24      funding.

      25             I think we need to take another look at what







                                                                   184
       1      we've been doing for the last 30 years, that hasn't

       2      been working, and whether it's the Rockefeller laws

       3      that shouldn't have been changed, whether it's this

       4      Good Samaritan law, that really concerns me.

       5             I mean, we need to hold people accountable.

       6             Gail spoke about just being concerned with

       7      the marijuana laws.

       8             But we have somebody that goes into an

       9      overdose, and because they call for help, the gloves

      10      are off.

      11             Now, how would that work as far as

      12      enforcement of our DWI laws, if somebody goes off

      13      the road and hits a telephone pole, and they get on

      14      the phone and call for help?

      15             Do they get a free ride for their DWI because

      16      they called for help?  No.

      17             We wouldn't have good enforcement if that was

      18      the case.

      19             So I think we need to take a look at the laws

      20      that we're already using, that aren't being

      21      effective.

      22             We need to look at the treatment programs.

      23             I served on both the village board and the

      24      school board with Dr. Dennis, and I've heard all

      25      this talk about, we have to get into the schools.







                                                                   185
       1             We've been getting into the schools.

       2             Okay?

       3             I think maybe what we need to do is to get

       4      into the families.

       5             We need two parents back in the household.

       6             We need some parents taking responsibility.

       7             We need to get into the families to get this

       8      dealt with.

       9                  [Applause.]

      10             MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN (ph.):  Asking the

      11      government for more funding, for more programs,

      12      I think it's time to take a step back and say, Wait

      13      a minute, what have we been doing with the funding

      14      we were already spending?

      15             I apologize for my delivery.

      16             My wife often tells me, Mike, it's not your

      17      message, it's your delivery.

      18             So, I apologize for that, and thanks for your

      19      time.

      20                  [Applause.]

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Michael, thank you very

      22      much.

      23             Michael was last, and certainly not least.

      24             Thank you for wrapping things up for us in

      25      good fashion.

       1             Alexis has something she would like to say

       2      down here regarding Truth Pharm.

       3             ALEXIS PLEUS:  Thank you so much for letting

       4      me do that.

       5             A lot of people spoke tonight about the

       6      community getting involved.

       7             And I agree with the Senators, they've put a

       8      lot of good legislation out last year, and the

       9      Assembly failed to pass, I believe, every single

      10      measure that you put in place, aside from maybe one.

      11             Truth Pharm is taking trips to Albany,

      12      February 25th, March 1st, March 15th, and

      13      March 16th.

      14             Any community member is welcome to join us,

      15      and we're going to visit Assemblymen and Senators in

      16      Albany, and we really -- we really, really, really

      17      need community support.

      18             We need more people to join us, more people

      19      to go to Albany and talk to our political leaders,

      20      and tell them the things that you're all talking

      21      about tonight.

      22             We need to go to Albany and talk to them

      23      face-to-face.  They need to hear from us.

      24             So you can find our information our on

       2             And we'd love to have anybody that would like

       3      to go with us, join us.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Alexis.

       5                  [Applause.]

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.  I want to -- it's

       7      almost 10:00.  We're going to wrap it up.

       8             I want to thank Penn Yan school system for

       9      the use of this beautiful auditorium here this

      10      evening.

      11             I want to thank all of our panelists for your

      12      time, your input on this; my colleagues for coming

      13      from all across the state to be here; for all of you

      14      for coming and attending and being so attentive for

      15      this.

      16             It shows the extent of the concern that this

      17      community has for this problem.

      18             And I agree with what all of our speakers

      19      said here this evening with regards to, this needs

      20      to be a whole community approach to this, and it's

      21      not just about money.

      22             We do look at refocusing our programs, but we

      23      have a $145 billion budget we're considering in

      24      Albany right now.

      25             We ought to be able to find the appropriate

       1      resources, or reshift resources, to focus more

       2      intensely on this.

       3             But it is going to take the community at

       4      large to really fight this, through our churches,

       5      through our community organizations, all of these

       6      groups to do that.

       7             So thank you, all, and please be active in

       8      your community.
