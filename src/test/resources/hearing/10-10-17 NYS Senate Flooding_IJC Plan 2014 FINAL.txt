       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  I want to thank everyone for

       2      coming out this evening on this very important issue

       3      that we have throughout the shore of Lake Ontario

       4      and the St. Lawrence River.

       5             So, I appreciate everyone coming out tonight.

       6             I'm Senator Tom O'Mara, senator from the

       7      Southern Tier area of New York; the Elmira, Corning,

       8      Hornell, Ithaca, area and the Southern Finger Lakes.

       9             I'm pleased to be here as Chair of the

      10      Environmental Conservation Committee in the Senate

      11      to host this hearing.

      12             I thank Patty Ritchie for her involvement in

      13      this issue throughout the entire past year.

      14             With that, I will turn it over to Patty for

      15      some opening remarks.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you, Senator.

      17             I would like to thank everyone for coming out

      18      tonight for this important hearing on the

      19      unprecedented flooding of the Lake Ontario and

      20      St. Lawrence River.

      21             I particularly want to thank my colleague

      22      Tom O'Mara, the Chair of the Senate's Environmental

      23      Conservation Committee, in holding this hearing so

      24      we can get some answers --

                                                                   5
       1                  (Member of the audience asks, "Is the

       2        mic on?")

       3             SENATOR RITCHIE:  -- so we can get some

       4      answers to some very important questions.

       5             I'd also like to thank Assemblyman Will

       6      Barclay and Assemblyman Bob Oaks who have been

       7      partnering with the Senate to address all of the

       8      concerns from the people that we represent.

       9             The record high quart of Lake Ontario and the

      10      St. Lawrence River have had a profound impact on the

      11      entire region; in particular, more than 150 miles of

      12      shoreline that I represent.

      13             From docks and breakwalls, to primary and

      14      seasonal homes, to the impact on local businesses,

      15      this devastation has been heartbreaking.  It will be

      16      years before people completely recover.

      17             But please know that we are all working hard

      18      to get people back on their feet and on the path to

      19      recovery.

      20             Visiting your homes and businesses, and

      21      hearing your stories, is why I, Senator O'Mara,

      22      Assemblyman Barclay, and Assemblyman Oaks enlisted

      23      the help of our colleagues to work with the Governor

      24      to deliver 45 million in emergency assistance to

      25      primary and seasonal property owners, businesses,







                                                                   6
       1      and local governments at the end of session.

       2             Then, to help make sure those who were

       3      affected were able to access those resources,

       4      I co-sponsored, along with my colleague

       5      Assemblyman Barclay, workshops in six communities,

       6      where we were able to answer questions, and where

       7      residents could learn about the assistance that was

       8      available to them.

       9             Which brings us here today.

      10             I've been working closely with the Governor's

      11      Office, as I shared concerns and stories about the

      12      shoreline damage.

      13             And as you have heard, as of last Friday,

      14      everyone who has applied for help will receive

      15      funding.

      16             I just want to take a moment to thank

      17      Governor Cuomo for listening to us, understanding

      18      the situation, and working with us to make sure the

      19      funding was available for all applications.

      20             I know many in this room, as we watched what

      21      was going on around the country and the other

      22      devastating storms, we were really worried that

      23      there wouldn't be any help, potentially, with the

      24      FEMA application, and where that was going to leave

      25      many of you.







                                                                   7
       1             So that was great news, to find out that the

       2      Governor was willing to the work with the Senate and

       3      the Assembly, to make sure that all the applications

       4      that had been turned in will receive funding, and

       5      that is something that's been important to all of

       6      us.

       7             All of us here were determined to hold this

       8      hearing because many of you suffered from this

       9      flooding.

      10             We know that you're still trying to recover,

      11      and that goes beyond money.

      12             The peace of mind that comes with hearing

      13      directly from all those involved is extremely

      14      important, since the question everyone is waiting to

      15      be answered, is whether this will happen again next

      16      year.

      17             There are a number of experts here today who,

      18      hopefully, can shed light on this issue.

      19             We also have families and business owners who

      20      have been affected.

      21             State agencies and the IJC have agreed to

      22      testify, to help us better understand Plan 2014.

      23             I personally want to thank them for coming

      24      here this evening.

      25             If we all understand the size of this







                                                                   8
       1      flooding issue and we work together, we will be

       2      better prepared for the future, and better prepared

       3      to take care of everyone who lives, works, and plays

       4      on the lake and the river.

       5             And tonight is an opportunity to hear

       6      directly from those of you who have been affected,

       7      whether you're a homeowner, a secondary resident,

       8      has been affected, or you're a business owner.

       9             So I want to thank you for coming out

      10      tonight, and taking time out of your busy schedule

      11      to be here.

      12             And I also want to thank, once again,

      13      Senator O'Mara for taking time out of his busy

      14      schedule to come and hold this hearing in my

      15      district.

      16             Thank you, Senator.

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Well, thank you, Patty.

      18             It's quite all right.

      19             I got some fishing in while I was here this

      20      weekend, so it's worth the trip.

      21             Assemblyman Barclay.

      22             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you, Senator.

      23             I will be very brief.

      24             I want to thank Patty Ritchie for the great

      25      job she's done in the Senate to help secure the







                                                                   9
       1      financial relief for those who are affected by this

       2      high water levels.

       3             And I also want to thank her for the great

       4      job she's doing to try to get additional funding, so

       5      we make sure everybody, as she mentioned, can get

       6      some relief from the high waters.

       7             I want to thank Tom, my friend

       8      Tom O'Mara/Senator O'Mara, who served in the

       9      Assembly for six years with Bob and myself.

      10             And what Tom didn't tell you, although he's

      11      Chair of the Environmental Committee in the Senate,

      12      he also -- we think of him has a resident here of

      13      Mexico, because his parents have a camp down on

      14      Ramona Beach.

      15             And, obviously, I want to thank my colleague

      16      Bob Oaks, on my far right, from Wayne County.

      17             He's intimately involved also with this

      18      problem because, obviously, Wayne County is being

      19      affected quite heavily like we are here.

      20             So, thank you all for being here.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Assemblyman Oaks.

      22             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Thank you, Senator.

      23             And I would just like to add my greetings.

      24             Thanks to my colleagues Senator O'Mara,

      25      Senator Ritchie, and Assemblyman Barclay.







                                                                   10
       1             Just focusing on this issue, for me, my

       2      district runs west, from the city of Oswego line

       3      to the Monroe County line.  So, through part of

       4      Oswego County, Cayuga County, Wayne County.

       5             And so the issue of, concerned about possible

       6      flooding, came up in recent years, as considerations

       7      were being given on what types of policies should

       8      oversee the lake.

       9             And then, clearly, this year we had the

      10      problem that affected all of us on the south and

      11      eastern shores and the St. Lawrence River area, that

      12      the impact of the high water.

      13             And, so, my major concern tonight, and

      14      interest, is listening, and hearing responses to

      15      questions about how we can move forward in a way

      16      that prevents future lake problems, and also puts us

      17      all on a path of protecting the property that people

      18      own, the businesses that operate, along that shore.

      19             So, I appreciate the opportunity, and the

      20      Senate and Senator O'Mara for coming here, and

      21      Senator Ritchie for providing that invitation, so

      22      that we can cover that issue tonight.

      23             Thank you.

      24             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Bob.

      25             And just to let you all know, briefly, a







                                                                   11
       1      little bit of my background, as Will alluded to a

       2      little bit:

       3             My parents are both graduates of Mexico

       4      Academy.

       5             My mother grew up two blocks down the street,

       6      across the street from here, so I've been coming

       7      here my entire life.

       8             My family has had a place on the beach, at

       9      Ramona Beach, for the past 36 years that I've been

      10      coming here.

      11             So I've been an avid boater and fisherman in

      12      the area, and take the concerns of Lake Ontario, its

      13      beauty, its natural wonder that we have, and the

      14      economic activity that is generated from that for so

      15      many.

      16             So we hope to learn tonight about how the

      17      programs of relief are going.

      18             And probably more importantly, for myself and

      19      others here, what do we expect next year, and the

      20      year after that, and the year after that?

      21             Is this the new normal because of Plan 2014,

      22      and where are we going?

      23             So I thank you all for being here.

      24             We're going to start out with

      25      Mr. Stephen Durrett, the alternate co-chair of the







                                                                   12
       1      International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board.

       2             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Thank you all very much.

       3             Good afternoon, members of the Senate

       4      Standing Committee on the Environment Conservation,

       5      and, ladies and gentlemen in the audience.

       6             My name is Steve Durrett.

       7             I am the alternate U.S. chair for the

       8      International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board.

       9             I am also a member of the senior executive

      10      service, civilian, for the U.S. Army Corps of

      11      Engineers, in the Cincinnati, Great Lakes, and

      12      Ohio River division.

      13             I am here today on behalf of Major General --

      14      Brigadier General, excuse me, Mark Toy, to represent

      15      the International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River

      16      Board, which I will refer to as "the board."

      17             General Toy regrets he could not make it.

      18             He is in the process of getting his training,

      19      and stuff.  He will be deploying to Afghanistan here

      20      next month.

      21             The board was established by the

      22      International Joint Commission and has ten members;

      23      five from the United States and five from Canada.

      24             Our primary duty is to ensure that outflows

      25      from Lake Ontario meet the requirements of the







                                                                   13
       1      IJC orders of approval.

       2             In my comments today, I would like to explain

       3      the hydrologic conditions which led to the record

       4      high water levels on Lake Ontario this year, and

       5      explain the water-level regulation activities the

       6      board carried out in accordance with the IJC

       7      December 8, 2016, supplemental orders of approval,

       8      referred to as "Plan 2014."

       9             I hope this forum provides the Committee and

      10      the public with an understanding of three facts:

      11             The extreme high water levels on Lake Ontario

      12      this year were primarily driven by extreme weather

      13      conditions.

      14             The extreme weather conditions --

      15                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Can we please -- hold the

      17      comments, please, during this hearing.

      18             STEPHEN DURRETT:  The extreme weather

      19      conditions cannot be reliably forecast months, or

      20      even weeks, in advance.

      21             And the potential impacts to all interests in

      22      the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system must be

      23      balanced when making water-management decisions.

      24             The high water levels on Lake Ontario this

      25      year primarily stem from two factors:  Heavy







                                                                   14
       1      rainfalls across the entire Lake Ontario and

       2      St. Lawrence River system that began in April and

       3      continued through early August, and, a related

       4      record-setting spring runoff event in the Ottawa

       5      River Basin.

       6             Two additional factors also play a role in

       7      increased water levels:  An unusual mild and wet

       8      winter we had this last year, and, the above-average

       9      inflows from the upper Great Lakes.

      10             Water levels on Lake Ontario began in

      11      January 2017, very similar to 2015 and '16, slightly

      12      above long-term average, with Lake Erie water levels

      13      above average.

      14             Unlike the years of '15 and '16,

      15      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system and the

      16      Ottawa River Basin received widespread,

      17      record-setting precipitation during the months of

      18      April and May, leading to high water levels and

      19      flood-related impacts simultaneously occurring on

      20      Lake Ontario and downstream in the Montreal region.

      21             During April, the total amount of water

      22      entering Lake Ontario, known as the "net total

      23      supply," was the second highest recorded since 1900.

      24             Net total supply includes precipitation,

      25      runoff from tributaries, evaporation from the lake







                                                                   15
       1      itself, and inflow from Lake Erie.

       2             The Ottawa River Basin also experienced heavy

       3      rainfall in April, leading to record-setting flows

       4      and one of the highest recorded since 1960.

       5             To balance flooding impacts between

       6      Lake Ontario and Montreal region, Plan 2014 includes

       7      the F limit, which was based upon previous board

       8      decisions making strategies -- board-making

       9      strategies.

      10             During high-water events in the 1990s, under

      11      the previous regulation plan, 1958D, the F limit

      12      determines the maximum outflow from Lake Ontario to

      13      limit flooding on Lake St. Louis near Montreal.

      14             In consideration of Lake Ontario's levels, it

      15      is a multi-tiered rule that attempts to balance

      16      upstream and downstream flooding damages by keeping

      17      the level of St. Louis -- Lake St. Louis below the

      18      given stage for a corresponding Lake Ontario level.

      19             Outflows were set in accordance with the

      20      F limit for the entire month of April.

      21             By April 28th, Lake Ontario water levels had

      22      reached Plan 2014 Criteria H14 high threshold.

      23             The Criteria H14 authorizes the board to make

      24      major deviations from the regulation plan to provide

      25      all possible relief to riparian owners both upstream







                                                                   16
       1      and downstream.

       2             After an extensive review of the high water

       3      levels occurring throughout the system, along with a

       4      number of potential outflow strategies, the board

       5      decide to continue following the F limit,

       6      recognizing that any greater increases in outflow

       7      would further increase flooding in the lower

       8      St. Lawrence River system, while only providing a

       9      minimal decrease to the Lake Ontario water levels.

      10             Moving into May, extreme precipitation

      11      continued across the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River

      12      Basin, and, on Lake Erie itself, resulting in the

      13      highest net total supply to Lake Ontario in May

      14      since 1900.

      15             When combined with April, the total -- the

      16      net total supply was the highest two months ever

      17      recorded on Lake Ontario.

      18             At the same time, more record-breaking rain

      19      on the Ottawa River Basin caused its outflows to

      20      peak at historic record rates, and induced more

      21      significant flooding in the Montreal area and

      22      further downstream.

      23             In accordance with the F limit, outflow from

      24      Lake Ontario was significantly reduced during the

      25      first week of May during the peak of Ottawa River







                                                                   17
       1      outflow.

       2             As Ottawa River flows subsided, Lake Ontario

       3      outflows was quickly increased, from 6200 cubic

       4      meters per second during the first week of May, to

       5      10,200 cubic meters per second by the last week of

       6      May.

       7             This flow rate exceeds the flow specified by

       8      Plan 2014, and was equivalent to the highest weekly

       9      average outflow released in 1993 and 1998.

      10             This was also considered to be the maximum

      11      outflow that could be released while maintaining

      12      safe velocities for navigation in the international

      13      section of the St. Lawrence River when Lake Ontario

      14      levels are high.

      15             Despite these record high releases, water

      16      supplies into Lake Ontario remained above average,

      17      and Lake Ontario continued to rise, peaking at a

      18      record high level of 75.88 meters by the end of May.

      19             At this time, the board concluded that any

      20      further increase in outflows would have further

      21      adverse impacts to water levels downstream, while

      22      only providing minimal lowering of the water levels

      23      on Lake Ontario.

      24             June and July brought more rain, which

      25      contributed to the second highest net total supplies







                                                                   18
       1      on record since 1990 for each of these two months.

       2             By June -- by mid-June, water levels

       3      downstream in Montreal began to decline, and

       4      the board increased the Lake Ontario outflow to a

       5      new record maximum weekly average outflow of

       6      10,400 cubic meters per second.

       7             This required the St. Lawrence Seaway to put

       8      in mitigation measures in place to ensure safe

       9      navigations could continue under the increased and

      10      current velocities that were caused by the increased

      11      outflow.

      12             As wet weather continued, the board

      13      maintained this high record flow of 10,400 cubic

      14      meters per second into early August, nearly six

      15      weeks, or eight weeks, of high record flows we were

      16      discharging through Moses-Saunders Dam.

      17             By the middle of August, hydraulic conditions

      18      improved, and since then, the Lake Ontario levels

      19      have been on a steady decline.

      20             In fact, Lake Ontario fell 13.8 inches during

      21      the month of August, which is the largest drop ever

      22      recorded during any month since records were

      23      maintained in 1918.

      24             It continued to fall in September, and

      25      dropped an additional 11 inches, which is the







                                                                   19
       1      largest decline on record for the month of

       2      September.

       3             Water levels are expected to continue to

       4      decline over the next several weeks, and with hope

       5      of average weather conditions, Lake Ontario water

       6      levels is expected to continue to decline and

       7      approach average water levels by the end of the

       8      calendar year.

       9             That concludes my accounts of the hydraulic

      10      condition and the board's role in level regulation.

      11             In summary:

      12             The magnitude of the record precipitation

      13      events that occurred this spring and summer were

      14      caused -- were the cause of high water.

      15             The coincidental high water levels and

      16      persistent rainfall, both upstream and downstream in

      17      the Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River system,

      18      presented a challenge in providing relief to

      19      riparian property and business owners system-wide.

      20             With the water levels of Lake Ontario

      21      starting in 2017, similar to '15 and '16, and no

      22      forecast that indicated the record-breaking weather

      23      arrived in the spring and summer, this year events

      24      demonstrates the uncertainty associated with

      25      long-term forecasts and the inability to schedule







                                                                   20
       1      proactive water releases in anticipation of extreme

       2      weather.

       3             I hope the Committee and the public have

       4      gained an understanding of the need to balance the

       5      impacts to all interests within the system, and the

       6      complexity of managing water levels during extreme

       7      weather conditions.

       8             Despite record outflows being released from

       9      Lake Ontario, they played a minor role in affecting

      10      water levels when compared to the effect of the

      11      weather conditions.

      12             Due to the large size of Lake Ontario, when

      13      compared to the capacity of the St. Lawrence River,

      14      relatively large changes in Lake Ontario outflow

      15      have a small effect in changing the levels of

      16      Lake Ontario, but may severely affect interests on

      17      Lake St. Lawrence and downstream in the lower

      18      St. Lawrence River near Montreal.

      19             Before closing, I would like to mention that

      20      the board, in conjunction with the Great Lakes and

      21      St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management Committee,

      22      will be producing a post high-water assessment.

      23             This assessment would document the hydraulic

      24      conditions, the actions taken by the board, compiled

      25      information on known impact, and identify any other







                                                                   21
       1      strategies that could have occurred under the

       2      current regulation plan.

       3             We hope to have this report available next

       4      year after data collection efforts are completed.

       5             Thank you for this opportunity, and I now ask

       6      the Senate Committee if they have any questions?

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, and thank you for

       8      being here this evening with us as well.

       9             Patty?

      10             SENATOR RITCHIE:  (No audio.)

      11             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I have a few, I think,

      12      relatively simple questions.

      13             Thank you for your testimony.

      14             First, can we get a copy -- do we have a copy

      15      of that testimony?

      16             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Yes, you do.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Oh, it is?

      18             Thank you.

      19             How is the board appointed?

      20             STEPHEN DURRETT:  The board is appointed by

      21      the IJC.

      22             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And you, essentially,

      23      if I understand the board, your job is, basically,

      24      the mechanics of keeping the water level; correct?

      25             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Our job is the execution of







                                                                   22
       1      Plan 2014, yes.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Which is, essentially,

       3      keeping the lake levels.

       4             Do you feel -- and this is more of an

       5      opinion, but do you feel, because of Plan 2014, your

       6      hands are now tied?

       7             Where, my understanding, in the past, the

       8      board had some leeway in regulating the lake.

       9             They thought, maybe it was going to be a

      10      heavy rainfall in the spring, they might level more

      11      water out than they would, you know, in a normal

      12      year.

      13             Have you felt, under the Plan 2014, that the

      14      board's, you know, hands are tied because of the

      15      plan?

      16             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I do not believe so.

      17             I think this is a record -- my opinion is,

      18      this is all based upon a record event.

      19             It's not a record event in one area.  It was

      20      a base -- really, it was a region-wide event that

      21      occurred over Lake Ontario and the lower

      22      St. Lawrence River.

      23             Whatever plan we would have in place, we

      24      would have had the same conditions.

      25             I believe we had the same conditions we had







                                                                   23
       1      this year, no matter what plan was in place.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  In the spring --

       3                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  -- if I understand the

       5      Plan 2014 correctly, you couldn't release water

       6      until you hit the 248 level?  Is that correct?

       7             STEPHEN DURRETT:  No.  We couldn't release

       8      till we hit the H14 criteria, which varies, from

       9      week to week, across the given year.

      10             That's when we have deviation authorities to

      11      change.

      12             But then it's a matter of balancing the

      13      interests upstream and downstream of Lake Ontario.

      14             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And how -- just, how do

      15      you get on the board?

      16             It's, the IJC, what, do you put a resume in?

      17             Or, how do people get on this control board?

      18             I know it's appointed by the IJC, but --

      19             STEPHEN DURRETT:  That would have to be a

      20      question for the IJC.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you.

      22             SENATOR O'MARA:  Senator Ritchie.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Just a couple questions.

      24             I guess I am a little confused on, and I need

      25      some clarification on, the deviation authority.







                                                                   24
       1             You're saying that, with what's in place now,

       2      you're not able to make changes, and there's a

       3      certain deviation authority.

       4             Has that changed in the last year under

       5      Plan 2014?

       6             STEPHEN DURRETT:  No, any major deviations,

       7      even under the 1958 plan, we would have to ask for

       8      deviation and do a payback.

       9             So there was rules in place even under the

      10      1958D plan as well.

      11             The 214 -- Plan 2014 tried to establish,

      12      based upon historical guidelines that we had had in

      13      1990s, in '93 and '98 events, how we regulated

      14      Lake Ontario, that was incorporated into the 2'14

      15      plan.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So there is no -- there's

      17      no change between what has been historically done

      18      and what was done under Plan 2014?

      19             STEPHEN DURRETT:  That would be hard to say,

      20      since it's hard to compare historical events, unless

      21      the floods, the rainstorms, and the events were

      22      exactly the same.

      23             And they are not exactly -- no two rain

      24      events or flood events are exactly the same.

      25             So it would be impossible to say there's no







                                                                   25
       1      difference between the two plans.

       2             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And in order to get

       3      authority to start a deviation plan earlier, where

       4      would that come from?

       5             STEPHEN DURRETT:  We would have to -- the

       6      board would have to request authority from the IJC.

       7             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And is that something that,

       8      potentially, you're going to look at doing in case

       9      this is an unprecedented wet spring next year?

      10             Is there anything that you're going to put in

      11      place that would, potentially, allow you to act

      12      sooner, or to ask for that authority to deviate from

      13      the plan?

      14             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Some of that data will come

      15      out in the post-flood assessment, to look at ways,

      16      is there anything we could have done differently

      17      last year, that we could apply to the change or make

      18      modifications to the plan?

      19             So, hopefully, some of those things may be --

      20      may come out in the post-flood assessment that we'll

      21      be looking at, that our adaptive management

      22      committee is looking into.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And I know it was taken

      24      under consideration, the flooding in Montreal.

      25             And just for my own knowledge, what was done







                                                                   26
       1      to control the outflow from the Ottawa River, which

       2      was then restricting what could be let out of the

       3      Robert Moses Dam?

       4             STEPHEN DURRETT:  The Ottawa River

       5      restrictions, I'm not familiar with because that's

       6      in Canada.

       7             I know, by talking to my Canadian

       8      counterparts, many of their dams along the

       9      Ottawa River were overflowing as they were, so they

      10      were already past the ability to do any kind of

      11      control whatsoever.

      12             They had reached capacity, and it was just

      13      the natural flow of river at that point.

      14             There was no control mechanism available to

      15      them.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So is there a way to ask

      17      that that be looked at?

      18             Because, if, in fact, there wasn't the issue

      19      with the flooding in Montreal, and the outflow from

      20      the Ottawa River could have been slowed down, then,

      21      it looks like we would have been able to have a

      22      greater release, which would have kept the damage

      23      down on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River.

      24             So, I understand it's a bi-national

      25      organization, but, how does that work, that the







                                                                   27
       1      Canadian board is asked to look at those issues

       2      also?

       3             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Well, they're part of the

       4      post-flood assessment.

       5             So, the Canadian and the U.S. government will

       6      both be looking at the post-flood assessment.

       7             What could be done on the U.S. side, what

       8      could be done on the Canadian side, that will all be

       9      part of the post-flood assessment.

      10             SENATOR RITCHIE:  (Technical difficulties/no

      11      audio.)

      12             (Inaudible) what consideration was given to

      13      the shipping?

      14             I know a lot of people were hearing on the

      15      news that, potentially, the water release was slowed

      16      down because of shipping.

      17             And what kind of consideration is given to

      18      shipping, versus personal property, businesses, that

      19      are affected by the high water?

      20                  [Member of the audience says "They're

      21        not."]

      22             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Consideration is given to

      23      all interests (inaudible) upstream and downstream on

      24      Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway.

      25             So, there's no plan or a formula that says







                                                                   28
       1      one interest gets more -- more -- more benefit than

       2      another.

       3             We try to look at all things: trying to

       4      balance the environment, trying to balance the

       5      riparian owners, trying to balance the navigation

       6      interests.

       7             The navigation industry put in some extreme

       8      measures because of the discharges we were

       9      discharging out of Moses-Saunders, at 10,200.

      10             They had to put some measures in place to

      11      help some of their boats.

      12             They limited the power on boats, so some

      13      boats could not travel through the St. Lawrence

      14      Seaway.  They were not powered appropriately.

      15             They also put some tugs to assist at some

      16      very key points along the seaway, to make sure that

      17      it was safe passage.

      18             We did not want an environmental spill, and a

      19      ship hitting a rock.

      20             So all those things were put in place, not by

      21      us, but by the Seaway itself.

      22             So other interests were considered, and it's

      23      a matter of balancing what is -- what's -- how much

      24      water is too much water upstream, or how much water

      25      is too much water downstream?







                                                                   29
       1             Discharging more than 10,400 will run the

       2      St. Lawrence River out of its banks.

       3             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I guess I would just have

       4      one comment for you to take -- one comment for you

       5      to take back.

       6             That if there is a mechanism in place that

       7      ties your hands under this deviation authority, that

       8      when it looks like there's a situation, going

       9      forward, that you need to adjust for, if there's a

      10      certain time frame for that to happen, or a level,

      11      that maybe somebody who's making the decisions take

      12      a look at that again, to untie the hands of the

      13      people who have to make adjustments.

      14             STEPHEN DURRETT:  And we're hoping to get

      15      that out of this post-flood assessment.

      16             Is there anything we could have done

      17      differently? we will document that in the post-flood

      18      assessment.

      19             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Assemblyman Oaks.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Yes, just to follow up on

      22      that, so, at this point, there's nothing that's

      23      happened -- you're going to do the assessment.

      24             So there's nothing that's happened this year

      25      that is changing your few tractions at this moment?







                                                                   30
       1             There could be something, depending on what

       2      you find through your assessment?

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  That is correct.

       4             There is nothing that we think we could have

       5      done differently this year, but the assessment may

       6      tell us something different.

       7             We, literally, had a region-wide, a regional

       8      flood event, that spanned, not only one area, but

       9      the entire region of Lake Ontario and the

      10      St. Lawrence Seaway.

      11             We had a lot of water that fell over several

      12      months a period of time that doesn't normally fall

      13      at that time of year.

      14             June and July were extremely wet months as

      15      well.  That's not normally wet.

      16             So we -- it was -- literally, was a

      17      basin-wide event.

      18             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  In the acceptance of

      19      Plan 2014, when discussions were about that, people

      20      raised concerns as we went through that process, one

      21      of the things that was adopted, was to accept,

      22      generally, that the plan allowed for higher heights

      23      in certain years, and, also, lower lows, than what

      24      the earlier maintenance plans did.

      25             At what point this year -- and if you said it







                                                                   31
       1      in your remarks, just to, you know, reiterate that,

       2      at what point this year did we meet what was the

       3      acceptable or encouraged higher height as a part of

       4      Plan 2014?

       5             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I don't know if there was

       6      actually -- I did not say in it my remarks, but

       7      there was not a point in time, I think, where we

       8      could actually say that you've met -- you know, you

       9      hit a point and you say, Oh, we're there.  We need

      10      to do something differently.

      11             The lake rose extremely fast in the

      12      March-April time frame.  And it -- by the time-- and

      13      there was, literally, nothing we could do.

      14             The lake jumped 80 centimeters in a matter of

      15      a couple of months, and it was all because of, like

      16      I said, the basin-wide flooding.

      17             We knew there was going to be problems, but

      18      there was nothing we could do because there was no

      19      place to send the water.

      20             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  But if we look at,

      21      I guess, and my concern, and your description of

      22      this event, we know it rained a lot this year, and

      23      we know there were, you know, various

      24      considerations, and I know there's different

      25      perspectives of why we ended up with what we have.







                                                                   32
       1             I'm very concerned about what happens next

       2      year and the year after, and beyond, is the sense

       3      that we have accepted more of higher water, and

       4      where, other years, lower water than what's been the

       5      norm, the impacts on those years that we have the

       6      higher waters, the defense, I remember saying, well,

       7      the increase is only a few inches.  It's about like

       8      a tennis-ball size.

       9             But in -- and a number of people's concern

      10      raised at that point was, in my understanding, every

      11      other high-water event, '73, '92, that the incident

      12      of the high water came quite quickly, and then it

      13      went down.

      14             And a concern of many of us was, 3 inches

      15      sustained for months is going to, ultimately, have a

      16      devastating effect on shorelines because we're going

      17      to get weather events in that time.

      18             And so the encouraged or acceptable levels

      19      also become a great deal more damaging than what

      20      high-water incidents were before.

      21             So do you think future high-water incidents,

      22      because of the plan, look for more sustained water,

      23      that we can -- if we continue with the plan as is,

      24      we're going to, on those high-water years,

      25      anticipate property damage, either approaching or at







                                                                   33
       1      levels that we've seen this year?

       2             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I can't predict the

       3      weather.  And that's part our problem with doing

       4      water management, is predicting the weather.

       5             [Audience member says "Can't hear you."]

       6             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Sorry.

       7             Part of our problem is predicting the

       8      weather, and we're not able to predict the weather

       9      very well.

      10             There is no one forecasted -- no weather

      11      forecast said we were going to have the amount of

      12      precipitation in 2017 that we had, for the whole

      13      basin.  Not just falling on just the Ottawa River or

      14      falling on Lake Ontario, but it fell up and down the

      15      entire basin, from the lower St. Lawrence, all the

      16      way up through the entire Lake Ontario region.

      17             So if we know that, then you can plan better.

      18             We don't know what the weather forecast is

      19      going to be.

      20             We have a lot of evaporation that occurs on

      21      Lake Ontario in the summer.

      22             If you don't have -- if you try to hold the

      23      lake too low, and you have a lot of evaporation,

      24      we're going to have a lot of dry docks instead of

      25      wet docks, because we just don't know the weather.







                                                                   34
       1             The thing is, we -- and by March -- the

       2      middle of March of this year, 2017, we were the same

       3      as we were in 2016.  There was no difference between

       4      '16 and '17.  The lake rose just look it did in '16.

       5             But the events then started in the April time

       6      frame, April and May, June and July, were all

       7      extremely wet months for the normal time of year.

       8             That's not predicted.

       9             Now, the lake will have a little bit higher

      10      highs and a little bit lower lows under lake --

      11      under Plan 2014, under normal river -- normal

      12      conditions.

      13             But that's a normal condition.  That's not

      14      extreme conditions.

      15             That's the key point I'd like to make, is we

      16      had extreme wet weather, not in an area, but across

      17      the entire region.  And it's the weather and the

      18      rainfall precipitation is what was the contributing

      19      factor for high lake levels on Lake Ontario.

      20             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  So you really can't say,

      21      under the acceptability level under Plan 2014, at

      22      what point it's kind of okay, and what point it's,

      23      you know, not okay?

      24             I understand we're going to be susceptible in

      25      the future to whatever the weather is, but there's







                                                                   35
       1      some anticipating that can be done.

       2             And, again -- or, outflow, you know, in the

       3      future, if it reaches to the higher level, some

       4      would say that there's property damage going to be

       5      caused even at that upper level.  And, certainly,

       6      with a storm or two, that people are going to suffer

       7      continually, irrespective of extreme high water,

       8      because we're accepting a level that's above what

       9      had been the norm.

      10             STEPHEN DURRETT:  And that's the purpose

      11      of -- built into Plan 24 (sic) is this H14 criteria.

      12             There's an upper and a lower band on this H14

      13      criteria which allows that, as what you referred to

      14      as, "a little higher high and little lower lows,"

      15      that we try to stay within.

      16             The plan operates, as long as you stay within

      17      that band, the plan runs as the plan is set up to

      18      run.

      19             Once we exceed those levels, whether you

      20      exceed them on the upper end or during a drought

      21      when you exceed them on the lower end, only does

      22      then does the board really come into play about

      23      asking and looking for deviations.

      24             That's how Plan 2014 is established and we're

      25      supposed to operate.







                                                                   36
       1             We will be looking at those levels:  Are

       2      those triggers too high or too low?

       3             Well, too low, we won't be able to look at it

       4      very well.

       5             But the "too highs" we can look at as part of

       6      our assessment.  Are the triggers too high?

       7             I can't tell you the answer to that question.

       8             I would say, at this point in time, the

       9      answer would be, I don't think the triggers are too

      10      high.  But, our assessment may tell us that, yeah,

      11      maybe the triggers are too high.

      12                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

      13             STEPHEN DURRETT:  But -- so that's part of

      14      the post-flood assessment.  We will look at those

      15      triggers, that H14 trigger elevation.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Well, isn't that the

      17      biggest different -- sorry, Bob.

      18             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Go ahead.

      19             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Isn't that the biggest

      20      difference between the old plan and the current

      21      plan, that your hands are tied, because you can't --

      22      isn't it 248, is that the number, before you go --

      23      when you can deviate?

      24             STEPHEN DURRETT:  There's no set number.  It

      25      varies from the time of year, depending --







                                                                   37
       1             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Well, you just

       2      mentioned the --

       3                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Excuse me.

       5             Excuse me.

       6                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

       7             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I know.

       8             Hold on.

       9             Excuse me.

      10             -- I just want to -- you mentioned "the

      11      bands."

      12             Could you just tell us what the "bands" are?

      13             STEPHEN DURRETT:  It depends on what month of

      14      the year you want to go.

      15             The H14 bands that I was referring to,

      16      there's a high H14 limit and there's a low band.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  What are the numbers,

      18      though?

      19             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Well, it changes from year

      20      to year.  I mean, I can't tell a number.

      21             Pick a month, and I'll be able to tell you a

      22      number.

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  All right.

      24             Take -- take April or May, the spring, when

      25      the water is high.







                                                                   38
       1             STEPHEN DURRETT:  It's somewhere around

       2      75.5 meters, approximately.

       3                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And then --

       5             Excuse me, excuse me.

       6             Sorry.  I can't have everybody yelling

       7      questions.  I can't hear.

       8             And then how was -- what was the band under

       9      the prior plan?

      10             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I can't tell you that.

      11             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.

      12             All right.

      13             Okay.

      14                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  You don't know what the

      16      criteria was under Plan 1958?

      17             STEPHEN DURRETT:  No, I do not.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Was the International Board

      19      involved in the formulating of Plan 2014?

      20             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I have only been on the

      21      board for 2 1/2 years, so, the Plan 2'14 was done

      22      prior to me arriving at the board.

      23             The IJC would be a better person to ask the

      24      question to.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  All right.







                                                                   39
       1             Now, on these so-called "trigger points," at

       2      the high or the low, what action can you at the

       3      board take, anticipating that trigger point being

       4      exceeded?

       5             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Prior to the trigger point

       6      being exceeded, we could ask permission to do a

       7      deviation from the IJC.

       8             Once the trigger point is achieved, we can

       9      make deviations, and then we notify the IJC.

      10             So, lower than the trigger, we have to ask

      11      permission.

      12             Higher than the trigger, we can -- actually,

      13      we just do notification.

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  It's my understanding that,

      15      for the past several years, Lake Erie's water level

      16      has been high.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  That's correct.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Is that your understanding?

      19             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Yes.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  And the flow of water from

      21      Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not controlled;

      22      correct?

      23             STEPHEN DURRETT:  It is somewhat controlled,

      24      yes.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  How is it controlled?







                                                                   40
       1             STEPHEN DURRETT:  We control -- it's

       2      minimally controlled, I'll say.

       3             But there's -- the control is mostly over the

       4      distribution of water between the United States and

       5      Canada more than it is the flow over the falls

       6      itself.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  And how high has Lake Erie

       8      been over the past four or five years?

       9             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I don't know that number

      10      off the top of my head.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  No?

      12             It's my understanding that, in February of

      13      this year, Lake Ontario levels rose as a result of

      14      the elevated Lake Erie levels in February, and no

      15      action was taken by the board at that point to deal

      16      with that increase.

      17             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Lake Erie's flows have been

      18      high for the last several years.

      19             Yes.

      20             ARUN HEER:  I just want to say -- I just want

      21      to mention, Bill Werick from the IJC is going to be

      22      speaking next.  He'll be able to answer your

      23      questions concerning the plan formulation a lot

      24      better than a board member here.

      25             So I just wanted to prep you up for some of







                                                                   41
       1      these questions you might have.  You're going to get

       2      a better answer from the next speaker.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

       4             What's your name, and who are you from?

       5             ARUN HEER:  My name is Arun Heer.  I'm the

       6      U.S. secretary for the board.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

       8             ARUN HEER:  You're welcome.

       9             Thank you.

      10             STEPHEN DURRETT:  So, I'm sorry.

      11             Can you repeat your question, or, do you want

      12      to save it for Bill?

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  There was no anticipatory

      14      actions taken by the board because of excess water

      15      coming from Lake Erie because of its elevated state

      16      in the month of February this year?

      17             STEPHEN DURRETT:  That is correct, because

      18      there was no real need to.  It did follow in a very

      19      similar path to what it did in 2016.

      20             In February -- the 2016 levels and 2017 were

      21      about the same in February.

      22             SENATOR O'MARA:  How much are the riparian

      23      landowners' rights considered in your determinations

      24      of what to do with the outflows of Lake Ontario?

      25             STEPHEN DURRETT:  They're considered with







                                                                   42
       1      every other interest.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  Is it weighted at any

       3      extent?

       4             STEPHEN DURRETT:  No.

       5             SENATOR O'MARA:  And what are those factors,

       6      other than riparian rights?

       7             STEPHEN DURRETT:  There's environmental

       8      interests.  There's riparian interests.  There's

       9      navigation interests.  And there's -- I'm missing

      10      one.

      11             [Member of the audience says "power."]

      12             STEPHEN DURRETT:  -- power.

      13             Thank you.

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  Power?

      15             What are those environmental interests?

      16             STEPHEN DURRETT:  A lot of those have to do

      17      with the sudden rise and lowering, of whether it be

      18      upstream or downstream.

      19             It's mainly about fish habitat.

      20             When you get into a flood event, the

      21      environmental interests are very minimal.

      22             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I just have one follow-up

      23      question.

      24             Earlier you stated that there was -- you

      25      noticed -- or, the board noticed that there was a







                                                                   43
       1      high water level and there was nothing that could be

       2      done.

       3             Can you just clarify what you mean by

       4      "nothing could be done"?

       5             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Well, balancing all the

       6      interests associated with it, you try to discharge

       7      water out of Lake Ontario, it's gonna go impact

       8      someone else.

       9             The water downstream was already at record

      10      levels as well.

      11             There was no place to put the water.

      12             The water, do I send it downstream? do I hold

      13      it where I'm at?

      14             It's a balancing act, when you're in a flood

      15      event, as to how you manage water and where you

      16      store it.

      17             Discharging, and increasing discharges, will

      18      have a very minimal impact on the level of

      19      Lake Ontario because the lake is so large.

      20             Increasing by 1,000 cubic meters per second

      21      is a very small amount of impact on Lake Ontario,

      22      but it could be devastating to what's downstream

      23      because of the St. Lawrence Channel is so narrow.

      24             So, we already were in a flood event

      25      downstream.  Changing something by a millimeter on







                                                                   44
       1      Lake Ontario could be several inches in -- on the

       2      St. Lawrence River downstream.

       3             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And the flood event

       4      downstream, was that mostly caused by the

       5      Ottawa River?

       6             STEPHEN DURRETT:  And other tributaries, yes.

       7             But the Ottawa River had record flooding.

       8             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Okay.

       9             Then I guess, one last question:  Once again,

      10      do you believe that, if you had the ability to

      11      release water before the situation with the

      12      Ottawa River was at that level, it would have helped

      13      the situation, or you don't believe it would have

      14      made any difference?

      15             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I don't believe it would

      16      have made any difference because, before the

      17      Ottawa River and the flooding event going on,

      18      I wouldn't have been wanting to release water.

      19             I would have stayed within the normal guides

      20      that tells our historical data from 1900.  We have

      21      115, 118 years of data, and we were within the

      22      normal range, up till March.  And then, all of a

      23      sudden, in April and May, it shot through the roof,

      24      but it shot through the roof everywhere across the

      25      entire basin; not just on Lake Ontario, but the







                                                                   45
       1      entire basin, including the St. Lawrence River

       2      Basin.

       3             There was no place for the water to go.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I know I have grave

       5      concerns after Senator O'Mara brought up the

       6      controls on Lake Erie, and the fact that there's

       7      minimum controls.

       8             But the people that I represent in the

       9      middle, their property was affected because of the

      10      controls that were used at Robert Moses to keep from

      11      flooding Montreal any worse than it already was.

      12             So, I guess that is a question, that I would

      13      hope it would be addressed when you go back, is

      14      that:  If the water levels are controlled and the

      15      outflow is controlled, at some portions along the

      16      system, then maybe Lake Erie ought to be controlled

      17      a little more than minimally.

      18             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Okay.

      19             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      20             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Just quickly following

      21      up again, when did the board -- do you have a date

      22      when the board realized that you might have to

      23      deviate from the Plan 2014?

      24             STEPHEN DURRETT:  I don't have a date off the

      25      top of my head, but I could give you a range, that







                                                                   46
       1      we probably were thinking --

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Even a month.

       3             STEPHEN DURRETT:  -- have to deviate in the

       4      April time frame.

       5             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And then what was the

       6      band that they were in when you understood that this

       7      was a flood condition where have to deviate from the

       8      plan?

       9             STEPHEN DURRETT:  We were still below the H14

      10      criteria.  But, we saw the rise, and we were

      11      starting to meet weekly, or every other week, and

      12      starting to talk about water levels and predictions,

      13      weather forecasts, and what we were gonna do, and

      14      what could we do?

      15             So we were meeting about every -- I'll say,

      16      on average, every two weeks, starting in, probably,

      17      the April time frame, all the way through August.

      18             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I can't -- the H --

      19      what was the band you called it?  What was it --

      20             STEPHEN DURRETT:  H14.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  H14.

      22             What is that in meters or inches?

      23             I prefer inches, but I'll take meters.

      24             STEPHEN DURRETT:  In the April time frame, it

      25      would be somewhere around, and it's kind of hard to







                                                                   47
       1      read off this chart, but about 246.8.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.  Thank you.

       3             STEPHEN DURRETT:  That would be feet.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Feet.  Right.

       5             I meant feet.  Sorry.

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much.

       7             STEPHEN DURRETT:  Thank you for your time.

       8             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next up, from the

       9      International Joint Commission, Bill Werick,

      10      technical advisor.

      11             BILL WERICK:  My name is Bill Werick.  I'm

      12      here representing the International Joint

      13      Commission.

      14             They asked that I attend because of a broad

      15      technical understanding of the regulation of

      16      Lake Ontario levels, and water resources more

      17      globally.

      18             I was the lead U.S. planner during the

      19      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River study in the 2000 to

      20      2006 range.  And I'm now a member of the IJC's

      21      Great Lakes Adaptive Management Committee.

      22                  [Slide show begins.]

      23             BILL WERICK:  In my testimony today I will

      24      make two points.

      25             The first, is that IJC's regulation of







                                                                   48
       1      Lake Ontario levels substantially reduces flood

       2      levels for people along the shore, but it does not

       3      prevent them.  These high levels are bound to happen

       4      again.

       5             The second point, is that any significant

       6      reduction in high-water damages will require a

       7      difficult, perhaps unprecedented level, of

       8      collaboration and innovation, with roles for the

       9      IJC, the state, local, and federal governments, and

      10      landowners.

      11             There is a history to this, and it is really

      12      informative.

      13             The IJC held its first meetings on this issue

      14      back in 1920.

      15             I'm from Buffalo, and I remember the

      16      opposition to the seaway.

      17             There were attempts for 30 years to get the

      18      seaway built, and they were rebuffed.

      19             On June 30, 1952, the two countries applied

      20      to the IJC for approval of a power project,

      21      including a hydropower dam.

      22             Now, we think of dams as raising water

      23      levels, but the regulation plan included in the

      24      application was designed so that the project would

      25      not raise the natural levels of Lake Ontario.







                                                                   49
       1             1952, coincidentally, the lake reached record

       2      high levels in 1952.

       3             These are pictures from the Rochester

       4      Democrat & Chronicle, on Edgemere Drive near Dewey.

       5             And the governments asked the IJC to study

       6      whether, having regard for all other interests,

       7      measures could be taken to regulate the level of

       8      Lake Ontario for the benefit of property owners on

       9      the shores of Lake Ontario.

      10             So this is the difference.

      11             In other words, could the project not just

      12      protect against higher-than-natural water levels,

      13      but actually lower them?

      14             So the IJC held hearings on this in '52, '53,

      15      and '55.

      16             Higher lake levels are generally better for

      17      producing power, and for providing water during

      18      droughts for navigation on the river.

      19             Hydropower interests argued that reducing

      20      high levels would increase construction costs and

      21      reduce power production.

      22             And, of course, this was the 1950s, so there

      23      was no consideration of the environmental impacts of

      24      damming the St. Lawrence River.

      25             Despite the costs of lost hydropower, the IJC







                                                                   50
       1      issued an order in 1956, with the criteria that

       2      provided flood relief for Lake Ontario coastal

       3      property owners.

       4             The order prescribed a range of mean monthly

       5      elevations for Lake Ontario, from 243.3, to

       6      247.3 feet, as nearly as may be.

       7             So what does that "as nearly may be" part?

       8             It reflects the fact that this regulation

       9      plan was designed by the engineers of the day, with

      10      water levels from -- water supplies from 1860 to

      11      1954.

      12             So water supplies, since regulation began,

      13      have included much wetter periods --

      14             You see the supplies on the right there in

      15      red.

      16             -- than were done historically.

      17             And the IJC said, if you run into this, if

      18      you have these higher supplies, you have to deviate

      19      to protect riparian owners above and below the dam.

      20             Looking at the graph of Lake Ontario levels,

      21      it's pretty obvious that, in most years, the dam and

      22      regulation did compress Lake Ontario levels, but you

      23      can see there's still levels with very high levels.

      24             So, in 1972, the Rochester Democrat &

      25      Chronicle reported that Lake Ontario was the only







                                                                   51
       1      lake spared flooding on the Great Lakes because of

       2      that new dam.

       3             But a year later, the paper reported that

       4      Lake Ontario had risen to damaging heights, not as

       5      bad as it would have been without the dam -- with

       6      the -- without the dam, but still damaging.

       7             I know many of you remember that.

       8             Another story from 1973 quoted Rochester

       9      realtors questioning how homes along the shore could

      10      be bought or sold.

      11             There had been $3 million damage in '52.

      12             The corps was saying, in 1973, the damages in

      13      Monroe County alone would be 7 to 10 million.

      14             That same year, the paper investigated

      15      charges that Lake Ontario was being kept needlessly

      16      high.

      17             They concluded property owners would have

      18      been worse off without the dam.

      19             They reported, the IJC proposal, that year,

      20      in 1973, the future lakeshore development should be

      21      subject to strict zoning and setback regulations.

      22             In 1993, just as the IJC was commissioning

      23      another big study for all the Great Lakes,

      24      Lake Ontario flooded again.

      25             In its 1993 report, the IJC again advised







                                                                   52
       1      that the project was not capable of full control of

       2      the water levels.

       3             Commissioners recommended land-use and

       4      management measures as the principal response to the

       5      adverse consequences of fluctuating water levels.

       6             Allowing the structural shore protection

       7      might be the only alternative for

       8      intensely-developed shorelines.

       9             The study reported that most private

      10      protection structures failed after 10 years, and

      11      encouraged the use of better structures, with

      12      provisions for inspection and approval of those

      13      plans.

      14             During the LOSLR study in the early 2000s,

      15      we considered -- we had much better analytic tools,

      16      and we considered a much broader range of water

      17      supplies than had occurred historically.

      18             We formed four teams that competed to produce

      19      the best regulation plan.

      20             We did statistical studies that showed the

      21      lake could go much higher than it even had in

      22      history.

      23             Now, the board concluded that changes to the

      24      criteria in the existing plan were not possible

      25      without harming some interests.







                                                                   53
       1             The Plan '58D, with deviations, came close to

       2      minimizing damages from Lake Ontario for the

       3      property owners.

       4             Because it reduced the range of rain -- the

       5      range and the variability of Lake Ontario levels,

       6      though, it also reduced the diversity of plant types

       7      along the shore and populations of animal species

       8      who feed on and live in the environments affected by

       9      the reduced water-level ranges.

      10             The board said that '58DD had caused

      11      dewatering drawdowns in the fall, through the early

      12      spring, to the detriment of some habitat and

      13      species.

      14             It took another 10 years of debate before

      15      Plan 2014 was ratified by the governments of Canada

      16      and the United States.

      17             And in 2017, the first year of its

      18      implementation, unprecedented weather condition

      19      caused Lake Ontario to rise even higher than it had

      20      in 1952.

      21             As this graph shows, IJC -- you can see on

      22      the top there, IJC regulations still lowered levels

      23      below what would be occurring naturally.

      24             And you can see on the bottom, as Mr. Durrett

      25      had talked about, it's because the dam allows much







                                                                   54
       1      bigger releases than would have occurred naturally.

       2             So, what should we do to prepare for future

       3      high-water conditions?

       4             My remarks reflect finding some other

       5      studies, as well as those done by the IJC, and my

       6      own experience in flood-damage reduction here, and

       7      all around the world.

       8             I'm a member of the Great Lakes Adaptive

       9      Management Committee, and we will review how

      10      Plan 2014 performed this year, but we already know

      11      that the regulation plan can only do so much.

      12             So the question then is:  What else can we do

      13      if we want real changes?

      14             First, even though this is a very emotional

      15      issue, it's really important that people stay

      16      committed.

      17             We know from experience, it's ironic, but

      18      it's time of crises that makes people do long-term

      19      strategic planning.

      20             We're all here together, this issue is on the

      21      table, but, in my experience, that window will

      22      close.

      23             In a few months, this will become an issue

      24      that has -- people remember, but they haven't acted

      25      on.







                                                                   55
       1             So it's really important that we stay engaged

       2      and that we act soon.

       3             Second, it's really important that we

       4      recognize how difficult this will be.

       5             So I see this happen all over the world, and

       6      the sad news is, is that, as you saw in this history

       7      here, that floods happen, and people get upset, and

       8      they look at what could be done, and the interest

       9      dies, and floods happen, and the cycle repeats

      10      itself.

      11             Part of that is because there are no easy

      12      answers.

      13             The kind of solutions that we might imagine

      14      are not solutions that everybody says, oh, that

      15      would be great, everybody is in favor of that.

      16             Consider shore-protection damages, for

      17      example.

      18             As the commission had said, no structure will

      19      last forever, but structures that are designed with

      20      heavier stone and are -- which are taller and

      21      designed for a 6 1/2-foot range will be more robust.

      22             But they're more expensive, quite a bit more

      23      expensive.

      24             People often talk about floodplain management

      25      as a solution.







                                                                   56
       1             I'm not really sure, we haven't gotten all

       2      the data yet, but I think that floodplain management

       3      actually has helped on Lake Ontario.

       4             When I look at the new homes that have been

       5      built, I think they are up higher, and that has

       6      reduced flood damages.

       7             Of course, there are a lot of older homes,

       8      there's homes with basements.

       9             And even when your home isn't flooded,

      10      outbuildings may be flooded.  You may have water on

      11      the street that makes it very difficult to live your

      12      life.

      13             And, finally, there's the erosion to property

      14      which has no shore protection, and this can be

      15      really difficult.

      16             This is going to happen no matter the

      17      regulation plan, although, the regulation plan can

      18      change the rate at which it happens.

      19             Now, some people who have no shore protection

      20      can build it, but it's very expensive, and there's

      21      environmental concerns about shore protection too.

      22      People are worried about hardening the shore.

      23             I've talked to landowners who have said,

      24      well, you know, when I lose the bank, I just drag my

      25      cottage back closer to the road.







                                                                   57
       1             But, of course, there are limits to that.

       2      It's not a satisfying solution at all.

       3             And then the big question:  What role should

       4      government play in helping private-property owners?

       5             And this is an issue that's been debated, not

       6      just here, but everywhere in the United States and

       7      in every country around the world.

       8             And the answer is different in different

       9      places, at different times.  And there's a trade-off

      10      between providing relief after a disaster and

      11      providing protection before the disaster.

      12             The IJC is involved in some efforts that may

      13      help.

      14             We're doing a study of flooding in the

      15      Lake Champlain Basin.  This just started.

      16             The interesting thing there, is there is no

      17      dam, so we're not talking about a regulation plan.

      18             We're only talking about land-management

      19      measures and flood-response plans; so, plans that

      20      better forecast floods, and help towns put out

      21      sandbags or other flood-control measures.

      22             And, we recognized the interest in this is

      23      bigger than Lake Champlain, and we want to make sure

      24      that we share those results with you.

      25             The IJC is also working with NOAA and Cornell







                                                                   58
       1      on flood forecasting and high-water response plans.

       2             In sum, my two points:

       3             Water-level regulation has helped, but it can

       4      only do so much;

       5             And the only hope for doing better in the

       6      future, this is very difficult, it almost never

       7      works, but there is hope if we work together.

       8             Thanks so much for organizing this meeting.

       9             This is the first time we've really had a

      10      hearing that have brought -- that's brought all the

      11      players together.

      12             This is the most important thing, that we

      13      start talking, and I really appreciate you doing

      14      this.

      15             And, I may be able to answer some questions

      16      on Plan 2014.

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

      18             Well, we really appreciate you being here as

      19      well, and thank you for your testimony.

      20             Would you like to start?

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Sure.

      22             Could you explain -- I just -- I don't know

      23      what the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River Adaptive

      24      Management Committee is.

      25             What is that?







                                                                   59
       1             BILL WERICK:  That is -- that's a -- it's an

       2      idea that's been talked about for a long time, but

       3      hardly anybody in the world does it.

       4             And the idea is, is that after you make a

       5      decision, you continue to monitor the evidence to

       6      make sure that your decision was right.

       7             So, in other words, you think, if I do this

       8      Plan 2014, we'll strike this kind of a balance

       9      between hydropower and navigation and

      10      shore-protection damages and the environment.

      11             And, typically speaking, when those studies

      12      are done, nobody then monitors every one of those

      13      things and says, hey, we were right about that, but

      14      wrong about that, and now let's think about

      15      adjusting.

      16             So in this case, the IJC has actually started

      17      monitoring programs, and our intent is to continue

      18      to watch, and in 15 years, or less, we will report

      19      on that and say, we could do better or we could do

      20      worse.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  So it's a committee

      22      that's put together by the IJC to give them advice

      23      on all the state -- you know, what's happening with

      24      all the different stakeholders --

      25             BILL WERICK:  Exactly.







                                                                   60
       1             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  -- along (inaudible) --

       2             BILL WERICK:  The actual results of the plan,

       3      and what could be done better.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.

       5             Were you involved in the Plan 2014, the

       6      implementation of Plan 2014?

       7             BILL WERICK:  I was involved as a planner, so

       8      I would run evaluation models, and -- yes.

       9             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Could you just go

      10      through that process?

      11             Because I think a lot of people are

      12      discouraged, the way Plan 2014 came in, and I think

      13      people are suspicious, because it was implemented

      14      in, what, December of -- what was it, last year;

      15      right?

      16             BILL WERICK:  Exactly.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And, you know, I've

      18      heard a lot of complaints, that there wasn't

      19      public -- appropriate public input on 2014.

      20             You know, you went through a lot of different

      21      iterations with different plans.  Some faded off.

      22      And then, all of a sudden, this one came out in,

      23      seemed like, the dead of night.

      24             BILL WERICK:  Sure.

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  So, maybe, if you could







                                                                   61
       1      explain the process that it went through for us.

       2             BILL WERICK:  So this is a process that

       3      probably, you could say, it started in the

       4      late '80s, with the Great Lakes Levels Reference

       5      Study.

       6             The first -- during the study that

       7      I participated in, and I know many of you did too,

       8      from 2000 to 2006, we had teams competing to produce

       9      better plans.

      10             And that study board made recommendations to

      11      the IJC for three different plans, and each one had

      12      a different nature, they stressed different balance

      13      of results.

      14             And there was a plan called "B+," which was

      15      more natural levels, and that's the predecessor to

      16      Plan 2014.

      17             The next several years, people -- the IJC had

      18      hearings on a plan that they called "Plan 2007."

      19             It was rejected by almost everybody.

      20             They came back with other studies.

      21             That B+ plan became Bv7, and there were many

      22      public hearings on that, with the people opposed and

      23      people supporting it, just as 2014 was.

      24             And they held a series of public hearings all

      25      along the south shore, before they wrote their







                                                                   62
       1      report to governments recommending Plan 2014.

       2             So, full public involvement up to that point.

       3             Now, once the IJC sends it to the

       4      governments, then the state department and

       5      department of foreign affairs each do consultations

       6      within their countries.

       7             And at that point, I don't -- I'm an outsider

       8      to that process.

       9             So, basically, at that point, each country is

      10      looking at it in their own interests.  And then they

      11      have negotiations, and they come back together.

      12             And, for me, that period of time was more

      13      opaque.

      14             But they, basically, accepted the

      15      recommendations of the IJC, with some minor edits.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Is the board fully --

      17      all the appointees still on the IJC?

      18             Has Trump made his appointees?

      19             BILL WERICK:  There are no new appointees by

      20      either the Prime Minister or the President.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  No new.

      22             Are there vacancies?

      23             BILL WERICK:  They're all people that were on

      24      the commission from years ago.

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  There are no vacancies







                                                                   63
       1      currently?

       2             BILL WERICK:  There's one vacancy on the U.S.

       3      side.

       4             Is there a vacancy on the Canadian side?

       5             No.

       6             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And then the Adaptive

       7      Management Committee, how many members are on that

       8      committee?

       9             BILL WERICK:  I think there are -- I would

      10      say ten.

      11             I can get you the list of people.

      12             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Anyone from the

      13      southern or eastern end of Lake Ontario?

      14             BILL WERICK:  I'd have to look.

      15             Nobody comes to mind.

      16             These are mostly agency people, so the Corps

      17      of Engineers has representatives.

      18             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I mean, I think --

      19      again, my concern is, and I think a concern of a lot

      20      of my constituents, is our voice isn't being heard

      21      by the IJC.

      22             I think we feel like, with the implementation

      23      of the Plan 2014, that the southern and eastern end

      24      of Lake Ontario are the losers in that process.

      25             So it would be nice to know at least there's







                                                                   64
       1      a voice there, and someone hearing the concerns of,

       2      particularly, the property owners along the lake.

       3             BILL WERICK:  Well, let's solve that problem,

       4      because the committee certainly knows that it has to

       5      have that connection.

       6             And we're in the process now of trying to

       7      establish those connections.

       8             And what we're looking for, really, is

       9      somebody from the community who speaks for the

      10      community.

      11             They can be skeptical.  They can be against

      12      Plan 2014.  As long as they're willing to work with

      13      us, and express the views of the community, we see

      14      that as an essential thing.

      15             So, that's something we'd like to fix.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  All right.  Let's do

      17      that.

      18             Thank you.

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  Patty?

      20             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And can I just ask for you

      21      to follow up on a previous speaker?

      22             As far as the deviation authority, do you

      23      believe that has changed with Plan 2014?

      24             BILL WERICK:  There are changes, and some of

      25      them are kind of technical.  But when you look at







                                                                   65
       1      the actual instruction to the board, it's almost

       2      identical.

       3             But the condition -- in other words, the old

       4      Criterion K under the old plan said, when supplies

       5      are greater than the supplies of the past, do

       6      everything you can for riparians above and below the

       7      dam.

       8             The question was:  When are supplies greater

       9      than the past?

      10             It was a very fuzzy notion.

      11             Now we have the trigger levels, so that the

      12      triggering mechanism is very precise and clear, and

      13      the instruction is about the same.

      14             It's when the water -- when the -- you exceed

      15      the trigger levels, do everything possible for

      16      riparians above and below the dam.

      17             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Do you believe the trigger

      18      level is set too high, given what's happened this

      19      past year?

      20             BILL WERICK:  No, and I'll say that for two

      21      reasons.

      22             The first is, is that, when you look back at

      23      this with the benefit of hindsight, you say, boy, if

      24      we had started releasing 10,000 cubic meters per

      25      second way back when, this would have been better







                                                                   66
       1      off.

       2             But the fact is, is that, as Mr. Durrett

       3      said, our forecasts for one month out are really not

       4      very skillful.

       5             You can look back at the forecasts that

       6      people made at that time, and they missed this

       7      completely.

       8             So, for instance, 2016 looked very much like

       9      2017.  And had you done that, you would have made

      10      the lower levels of 2016.

      11             Lake Ontario ended up below average, much

      12      lower.

      13             So you have to kind of play the odds.

      14             The second thing is, is that Plan 2014 builds

      15      in a lot of the decision-making that the board used

      16      to do anyway, so that, as the water levels rose

      17      higher, and as Mr. Durrett talked, they were

      18      operating under this F limit.

      19             They were releasing as much water as they

      20      could, balancing the flooding that was occurring

      21      downstream.

      22             And, in fact, the best test of that is that,

      23      when they finally got to the end of April and hit

      24      the trigger, they continued to use that same F-limit

      25      strategy for some time.







                                                                   67
       1             So you could argue that, from a mechanical

       2      viewpoint, once they hit the trigger, they were

       3      already doing everything they could to lower

       4      Lake Ontario level.

       5             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And the previous speaker

       6      spoke about meeting every two weeks, which that

       7      probably does not sound great to people who were

       8      dealing with the water levels on an -- any given

       9      hour, how much it was fluctuating.

      10             So is there -- will that be taken into

      11      consideration, that maybe there should be more,

      12      either on-the-ground people seeing what's actually

      13      happening here, or meeting more regularly, so things

      14      can be changed at a quicker pace?

      15             BILL WERICK:  I'll let -- Mr. Durrett,

      16      correct me if I'm wrong -- but I know, from

      17      monitoring the situation, that there is a -- what

      18      they call "the coordinating committee" that advises

      19      the board.  These are technical guys.

      20             And these guys are looking at electronic

      21      readouts of all of these measurements, and they are

      22      constantly talking to one another.

      23             So this is not something that they check in

      24      every two weeks.  This is something that they watch

      25      all day long.







                                                                   68
       1             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And I know there was great

       2      concern by the people that I represent, that

       3      Montreal's interests were being represented at maybe

       4      a higher level than our own, given the fact that the

       5      Ottawa River was a pretty significant contributing

       6      factor.

       7             What will be done in working with the

       8      Canadians to try to address the outflow from the

       9      Ottawa River, if that's what significantly decreased

      10      the ability of the Robert Moses Dam to release

      11      water?

      12             BILL WERICK:  You know, we are in the process

      13      now of outlining our report on this year.

      14             And I would say, one of the things that we

      15      can do with you, and with the representatives we

      16      work with, is try to articulate those questions that

      17      are on everybody's mind.

      18             My gut feeling now, is that there isn't much

      19      that could have been done about the Ottawa River

      20      discharge.

      21             But let's make that, and other questions,

      22      part of that report, and we'll try to have a really

      23      good answer for that.

      24             Because, this is the hard part, it's really

      25      important that we establish a factual basis for any







                                                                   69
       1      modifications we make in the future, whether it's to

       2      the regulation plan or to other decisions that are

       3      made.

       4             So, we'll work with you to develop a list of

       5      questions that that report should answer.

       6             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Because I personally am

       7      concerned that the people that I represent are

       8      getting the squeeze on both ends.

       9             That, now it comes out that Lake Erie is

      10      minimally controlled, and what was possibly been

      11      able to happen to help in the middle, couldn't

      12      happen because of the situation in Montreal.

      13             So, if this is going to be a solution to the

      14      problem as a whole, how do we make sure that the

      15      Lake Erie part of the conversation and the

      16      Ottawa River part of the conversation is held

      17      accountable to the same level?

      18             BILL WERICK:  You know, we can -- we can

      19      answer those questions.

      20             I grew up on Lake Erie, and I can say with

      21      even more confidence, that Lake Erie will not be

      22      regulated.

      23             I mean, they have looked at that in the past,

      24      and the downsides to it are so great, that it almost

      25      isn't even worth asking anymore.







                                                                   70
       1             So I -- that -- I can answer you now, that

       2      Lake Erie is not going to be regulated, unless the

       3      world changes a lot.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And if there are

       5      recommendations put forward, how does the plan

       6      actually get changed by, whose authority?

       7             BILL WERICK:  Yeah, that's a good question.

       8             I mean, if you look at the names of these

       9      plans, 1958, 2014, you realize these plans don't

      10      change very often, and it's because they are so

      11      important to so many people, and they require a

      12      buy-off -- an international buy-off between the two

      13      countries.

      14             That said, because of the Great Lakes

      15      Adaptive Management Committee, we want to be open to

      16      great ideas, and there is a mechanism for us to

      17      report back to the IJC.

      18             I don't see us making any enormous

      19      breakthroughs.  But, if we can find ways to tweak

      20      the plan to make it better, then we have complete

      21      freedom to recommend those things to the IJC.

      22             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And my last question:  Do

      23      you believe the people who are dealing with the

      24      damage this year, are they going to be dealing with

      25      the same situation next year, or the year after?







                                                                   71
       1             BILL WERICK:  Boy, I have no idea, and I'm

       2      saying that not casually, because I've tried very

       3      hard to make those projections.

       4             If you look at 2015, 2016, and 2017, and you

       5      look at Lake Ontario and Lake Erie levels, they're

       6      all pretty similar, and yet each one of those years

       7      turned out so differently.

       8             It's -- I will say that, over the next

       9      20 years -- as you saw, I showed you pictures of

      10      floods in '43, '47, '52, '73, and '93.

      11             Over the next 20 years this will probably

      12      happen again.

      13             Climate change, the very warm winters, this

      14      may make it more likely.

      15             But, next year, I have no idea.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Your giving the historical

      18      perspective was helpful, I think, in seeing how

      19      things have developed over those years, and your

      20      contention that, without the dam, without the

      21      seaway, this year probably would have been worse

      22      than if there was nothing there.

      23             I think I can, you know, understand.

      24             However, under the new terms, and looking

      25      forward, we're saying we're going to manage it less.







                                                                   72
       1             And so we have the opportunity -- we

       2      controlled, and we tried to stay here, and

       3      conditions have taken us outside of it in different

       4      years.  But now we're saying we're opening it up.

       5             And so I guess one of my questions, in

       6      looking at it:

       7             '43, '47, '52, that's good history.

       8             Do we have any sense -- and I didn't see --

       9      you know, we have the chart showing this.

      10             Do we have any sense of days of flooding that

      11      occurred those years, as well as '73 and '92,

      12      compared to 2017, which that flooding sustained?

      13             And, does the plan -- I guess as a follow-up,

      14      does the plan encourage more days that we then have

      15      to deal with higher waters and potential for

      16      flooding?

      17             BILL WERICK:  Okay.

      18             So, this is a good question to ask, and

      19      answer more formally in the report, but let me make

      20      some general comments off the top of my head.

      21             The first is the obvious, that it's --

      22      I understand that it's cold comfort to say it would

      23      have been worse with the dam, because this is the

      24      worst flood that's ever happened in -- since the

      25      Civil War on Lake Ontario.







                                                                   73
       1             And, you know, I've worked on flooding since

       2      1969.  And I know that if you go through a flood,

       3      people just don't understand how terrible that is

       4      until you've gone through it.

       5             So I know it offers cold comfort.

       6             The next thing I would say is that,

       7      Plan 2014, as the IJC has reported, does produce

       8      higher highs and lower lows.

       9             That generally happens in the middle highs,

      10      in the middle lows.  That's where you'll see a

      11      difference.

      12             And there are impacts to things along the

      13      shore that are in that elevation range.

      14             So Mayor Turtenac (ph.) is in the audience

      15      tonight, and we've talked about parts of Sodus that

      16      are vulnerable in that medium-high range.

      17             Shore-protection structures that are not

      18      built as high are going to be more susceptible to

      19      overtopping, and that's why the damage figures for

      20      Plan 2014 are a little higher.

      21             Now, as the floods get worse, the new plan

      22      gets to be more like the old plan, for two reasons:

      23             One is, is that it doesn't do us much good

      24      for the environment to have floods, so there's no

      25      impetus in the plan rules to say, oh, let's have a







                                                                   74
       1      flood, it will be good for the environment.

       2             The plan does try to control flooding.

       3             And -- so, especially, once you get to the

       4      deviations, there's really no difference between the

       5      plans, and this is where you get the tennis-ball

       6      comparison.

       7             In real life, most of the time, with moderate

       8      floods, Plan 2014 will have slightly higher water

       9      levels, and that's because it's keeping the levels

      10      higher in the fall and the spring for the benefit of

      11      wetlands and everything that lives on there.

      12             As the water levels get higher, the two plans

      13      will be more alike.

      14             Every once in a while Plan 2014 is better for

      15      shoreline residents than the old plan because it

      16      also does lower lows.

      17             So if you have a year where Plan 2014 draws

      18      the lake down, and have a flood the next year, and

      19      this is not the majority, maybe one in five, then

      20      the new plan is actually better.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Your -- the plan does

      22      call, my recollection is, that over a 20-year

      23      period, when we've typically seen a flooding event

      24      in a 20-year period that we might see because of

      25      higher highs, that happened, maybe, three times







                                                                   75
       1      during that 20-year period, is that the estimate of

       2      the plan, and similar on lower water as well?

       3             Or is --

       4             BILL WERICK:  The -- if you look at the

       5      frequency of stages, Plan 2014 tends to have more

       6      frequent middle-high levels, and then they start to

       7      go back together on the higher levels.

       8             And as far as the sequence, there are people

       9      that argue that there are some sorts of cycles at

      10      work here.

      11             If you go out to North Dakota, you can see it

      12      on a lake called Devil's Lake, that it almost

      13      disappeared in the '40s, and then it came back,

      14      and had enormous floods in the '90s and 2000s.

      15             I think people who live along the lake would

      16      remember this, the '60s as a low-water period.  We

      17      had lots of years where Lake Ontario was low.  It

      18      seemed to be a persistent multi-year thing.

      19             And the '70s, '80s, and '90s were

      20      considered wet.

      21             And then the 2000s, and going into 2015, was

      22      considered a low-water condition.

      23             So we had, not on Lake Ontario which is

      24      regulated, but up on Lake Superior, and

      25      Lake Michigan and Huron, people were very upset







                                                                   76
       1      because the lake was so low.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  On the business interests,

       3      I guess just in this thinking, I mean, this was

       4      because of the days of flooding and the damage done.

       5             BILL WERICK:  Yes.

       6             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  For many, this was a lost

       7      season of recreational boating, of marinas, of

       8      businesses that serve people, et cetera.

       9             Is that -- again, the concern would be, a lot

      10      of our economy is driven by those.

      11             With this plan, are we setting those

      12      businesses up to have other lost summers, or is

      13      there a way to minimize the days even in those

      14      high-water times -- minimize the lost days, you

      15      know, and trying to narrow those events?

      16             BILL WERICK:  So with the very high events,

      17      I would say there won't be much difference.

      18             I think this year was a particular year where

      19      we said, we really can't see any difference between

      20      2014 and the old plan, and in part, that is because

      21      the fall levels were set by the old plan.

      22             As you get into moderate flood years, there

      23      will be marinas that start to suffer business losses

      24      before other marinas do, and Plan 2014 will tend to

      25      be a little worse for them.







                                                                   77
       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Again, thank you.

       2             One thing that I'm having trouble

       3      comprehending here, is where you say that a dam

       4      along the St. Lawrence River actually helps lower

       5      Lake Ontario levels.

       6             BILL WERICK:  Yeah.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Can you expound on that a

       8      little bit?

       9             BILL WERICK:  Sure.

      10             I mean, it's -- you think of a dam as, like a

      11      beaver, builds a dam and the level goes up.

      12             So the difference is -- and I just worked on

      13      the study on Rainy Lake in northern Minnesota, and

      14      the dam cannot bring the lake down.

      15             So if you look at an undammed situation, the

      16      water that flows out of a lake will be a function of

      17      how high the lake is.

      18             You can't have a big discharge unless the

      19      lake is really high.

      20             But what was different about the St. Lawrence

      21      project, and this is what the hydropower companies

      22      complained about, is that they did excavations.

      23             So now the board has the ability to create

      24      much greater discharges than they would have without

      25      the dam, because of that excavation, and because of







                                                                   78
       1      that they can actually lower water levels.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  Can you talk a little bit

       3      about, you know, we're here as New York State

       4      Legislators, representing the south shore and the

       5      eastern shore and the river.

       6             We haven't heard much, at least I haven't,

       7      about damage around the rest of the lake, the north

       8      shore, the west shore.

       9             What were the impacts of those shorelines

      10      throughout this year?

      11             BILL WERICK:  The Great Lakes Adaptive

      12      Management Committee is trying to collect damages

      13      for the north shore, south shore.

      14             We're working with the New York Sea Grant and

      15      Cornell to do that.

      16             And then we're also trying to get the damages

      17      downstream, and separate the St. Lawrence-related

      18      damages from all the other flooding that Quebec had.

      19             In general, I think that the north shore had

      20      less damage.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Was that expected in the

      22      Plan 2014 considerations?

      23             Because I kind of recall that being an

      24      expectation.

      25             BILL WERICK:  I would expect it, yes.







                                                                   79
       1             I think, and this is something we were trying

       2      to document, that Canada has taken more aggressive

       3      measures to reduce its vulnerability to flooding.

       4             Also, northwest and northeast winds are

       5      really harmful to the south shore, whereas they

       6      aren't to the north shore.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  You mentioned in your

       8      presentation that Plan 1958DD came close to minimal

       9      damage from the regulation.

      10             BILL WERICK:  Yes.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  So, 1958DD was particularly

      12      designed to minimize shoreline damage?

      13             BILL WERICK:  Almost.

      14             I mean, it does -- '58D also balanced all the

      15      different interests.  But, during that study, we --

      16      we -- basically, we created these things called

      17      "fence-post plans."

      18             What if we disregarded everybody else, except

      19      hydropower, how much good could we do for

      20      hydropower?

      21             What if we disregarded everybody else, except

      22      riparians, how much good we could do?

      23             And you could do a little bit better than

      24      '58DD if you didn't care about anybody else in the

      25      system, which, of course, I have to say is forbidden







                                                                   80
       1      by the treaty.

       2             But we said '58DD is pretty close to as much

       3      you can do with that dam and channel.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  So changing it to Plan 2014

       5      by -- basically, raising it by about 2-1/2 inches?

       6             BILL WERICK:  The highest level by about

       7      2-1/2 inches, yeah.

       8             SENATOR O'MARA:  The highest levels, yeah,

       9      and the lowest levels.

      10             It was known that there would be an increase

      11      to property damage --

      12             BILL WERICK:  Yes.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  -- as a result of that, when

      14      you exceeded those highs?

      15             BILL WERICK:  We -- we -- our models expected

      16      that.

      17             Now, we're going back to check that too.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yeah.

      19             Yet, in Plan 2014, in the IJC, and, frankly,

      20      the countries of Canada and the United States, did

      21      not provide any remuneration for the shoreline

      22      property owners for that expected damage?

      23             BILL WERICK:  That's correct.

      24             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you know why that was?

      25             BILL WERICK:  I would say -- I would say







                                                                   81
       1      that, as I showed in the historical slides, the IJC

       2      had to approve the dam.

       3             They were required by the treaty to protect

       4      riparian interests.

       5             So they had to assure that the water levels,

       6      because of that dam, would be no higher than they

       7      would be without the dam.

       8             That's when the treaty would have required

       9      mitigation.

      10             In either case, Plan 2014 or '58DD, water

      11      levels are substantially below natural levels, so

      12      that's why it wouldn't be required.

      13             Now, my argument is, set aside the treaty

      14      requirements, look at the problem, that there are

      15      damages, and ask with an open mind and heart, what

      16      could be done?

      17             Understanding, that there are many people who

      18      believe that government shouldn't help private

      19      property owners in these circumstances, but also

      20      arguing that, in almost every case, and we've seen

      21      so many of these stories on the news, government

      22      does help to pay for damage after it has occurred.

      23             It just doesn't like to pay for damage before

      24      it occurs.

      25             So this is why I'm calling for an open-minded







                                                                   82
       1      collaborative approach.

       2             It's going to be very difficult.

       3             There are not many communities who solved

       4      this problem, but, it's worth a try.

       5             And this interest is only going to be

       6      sustained for a few more months.

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Now, the trigger points, the

       8      highs and the lows under the new plan, those are

       9      based off of the average high for that time of year,

      10      and the average -- or, the -- I'm sorry -- the

      11      average of the extreme high for that time of year

      12      and the extreme low of that time of year?

      13             BILL WERICK:  The high levels represent,

      14      I think, the 2 percent exceedance frequency.

      15             So they're a fairly high level, and they were

      16      based on experimentation that was done with

      17      different levels, watching the trade-off between

      18      economic and environmental benefits.

      19             So they varied throughout the year, just like

      20      Lake Ontario does.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yeah, but I guess what I'm

      22      getting at is, averaging off of the extreme highs

      23      and the extreme lows, why didn't the commission take

      24      a median approach, as opposed to an average of the

      25      extremes?







                                                                   83
       1             And do you know what the difference is over

       2      the years between the median and the extreme highs

       3      and lows in that average?

       4             BILL WERICK:  So let me say this:

       5             That the H14 high triggers represent the

       6      levels that would be reached about 2 percent of the

       7      time, so they don't relate to the median.

       8             These are all about the frequency of those

       9      high levels.

      10             And we actually simulated these things, and

      11      we would try 1 percent, we would try 2 percent, we'd

      12      try different levels, and we would watch all our

      13      models to see what results came out.

      14             And it is finally the governments that

      15      decided on the "295" that became part of the new

      16      orders.

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Just in my mind, it seems

      18      like using a median, or what happens more often,

      19      rather than using the extremes, we base these

      20      numbers on the extreme.

      21             So now we're basing it at 2-1/2 inches higher

      22      than what our extremes are in history has been,

      23      rather than what a normal year is.

      24             BILL WERICK:  It is based on higher levels.

      25             The lower you make those trigger points, the







                                                                   84
       1      less damage you would have, and the more the plan

       2      becomes like '58DD, bad for the environment, but

       3      causing less damage.

       4             That was the -- that's the balance that you

       5      strike as you adjust those triggers.

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Well, if the dam was

       7      designed not to change the water levels of

       8      Lake Ontario, which you said it was --

       9             BILL WERICK:  Yes, it was designed to reduce

      10      the water levels.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yeah.

      12             BILL WERICK:  The high levels.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  -- so, I don't follow how we

      14      then had to alter it later on, to have a more

      15      environmentally-friendly ebb and flow of the level

      16      of the lake.

      17             BILL WERICK:  This was a decision that the

      18      two governments made, to recognize that the

      19      environment is an interest that both countries have,

      20      and is protected by the treaty.

      21             The 1950s is -- I mean, I'll say, when

      22      I started out with the Corps of Engineers in the

      23      '60s as a summer school -- summer student at

      24      Conesus, I worked in the Cuyahoga River, and I had

      25      to wear -- in the summertime, I had to wear rubber







                                                                   85
       1      gear from head to foot, because we knew that you

       2      couldn't let river water touch your skin.

       3             So that was the climate under which '58DD was

       4      designed.  There was absolutely no interest in the

       5      environment.

       6             On the LOSLR study, we tried to do something

       7      for the environment, while doing as little damage as

       8      we could to the shoreline protection damages.

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  What in Plan 2014 will allow

      10      the international board to make anticipatory changes

      11      before that trigger point is hit?

      12             BILL WERICK:  The board can't deviate until

      13      it hits the trigger.

      14             But as Mr. Durrett said, even before they

      15      hit the trigger, they were operating under the

      16      F limit.

      17             So Plan 2014 really incorporates the

      18      knowledge of board representatives, and guys like

      19      David Fay (ph.) who's in the audience, because it's

      20      the intent of Plan 2014 to avoid those floods.

      21             And, those rules are based on tests with

      22      50,000 years of different possible inflow, so

      23      there's many different ways that Lake Ontario can

      24      flood.

      25             So even before you hit the trigger, Plan 2014







                                                                   86
       1      is trying to reduce those water levels.

       2             When it comes to the trigger, then the board

       3      is free to do much more, it can go off the plan.

       4             Now, in this year, they still stayed on the

       5      F limit because the plan was good.

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  So the board then can

       7      increase outflows from the river before the lake

       8      level hits that trigger level?

       9             BILL WERICK:  Plan 2014 will increase

      10      releases naturally, generically, as part of the

      11      code.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

      13             You suggested in your remarks that the

      14      outflow from Lake Champlain might be looked at, as

      15      far as damming that lake.

      16             You didn't mention anything in your remarks

      17      about controlling the outflow from the Ottawa River

      18      which was a factor in the flooding this year.

      19             BILL WERICK:  No.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  What -- what's the

      21      distinction there?

      22             BILL WERICK:  First of all, we're not going

      23      to look at damming Lake Champlain.

      24             So the last dam study that I got involved in,

      25      it lasted 30 years, and at the end of the 30-year







                                                                   87
       1      study the dam was rejected.

       2             So we're not building many dams anymore.

       3             So we're not gonna even think about building

       4      a dam on Lake Champlain.

       5             That's why the focus is all on the land-side

       6      measures, and then, also, flood response plans.  So

       7      helping communities respond better to floods so that

       8      they can minimize the damage.

       9             On the Ottawa River, this is one of the

      10      questions we'll answer better and more formally than

      11      I can do right now.

      12             My belief is, that the Ottawa River has some

      13      regulation in the upper part of the basin, but it

      14      has very little impact, and this year had almost no

      15      impact.

      16             So, we'll answer it more carefully, but

      17      I would say there's very little hope that

      18      controlling the Ottawa River can make things better.

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

      20             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Just one quick

      21      question.

      22             I'm a little confused on your flooding

      23      comment you made about flooding not being good for

      24      the environment, so Plan 2014 does not, I guess --

      25             BILL WERICK:  Yes.







                                                                   88
       1             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  -- regulates against,

       2      I assume you're saying, extreme flooding.

       3             But the whole idea is to have water flow into

       4      the wetlands and have an ebb and flow.

       5             But, I guess, if you're a property owner, and

       6      that ebb and flow is ruining your property, you

       7      would consider it a flood.

       8             I mean, am I understanding your -- you're

       9      talking about extreme flooding?  Is that what --

      10             BILL WERICK:  That's really the difference.

      11             So, Plan 2014 -- so, typically, a dam

      12      operator who's only worried about flooding, because

      13      there's always uncertainty about what's gonna happen

      14      in the spring, they will lower the dam levels, just

      15      in case.

      16             The thing is, is that if you do that, then

      17      every year the wetlands are flooded less, and that

      18      has an impact on wetlands.

      19             So to produce a higher level of water on the

      20      wetlands, and we're not talking a flooding level,

      21      just a higher level, then you slightly increase the

      22      risk that you will have floods later on.

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Why did the Plan 2014

      24      take away the discretion of the control board?

      25             I don't -- I mean, you can say this is our







                                                                   89
       1      policy.  We want to have a more ebb and flow.  You

       2      guys gotta follow through with our policy.

       3             But why tie their hands and have certain

       4      higher, you know, catch levels?

       5             BILL WERICK:  I think it's a good thing,

       6      although people will argue about it.

       7             I think Frank Sciremammano would say that I'm

       8      wrong.

       9             Here's the difference, is that when the board

      10      confronts a decision, and its hands aren't tied,

      11      then it makes a reactionary decision, that has a

      12      little amount of time to study what the

      13      possibilities are.

      14             Sometimes it does good, and sometimes it does

      15      bad.

      16             With more regulation, you have the benefit of

      17      studying these things with many more tests.

      18             So the rules of Plan 2014 have been tested to

      19      a much greater degree than the board decisions could

      20      have been in the old days.

      21             And, in fact, when the IJC first had hearings

      22      on Plan 2007, this was a discussion because 2007 was

      23      not an environmental plan.  It was at least as good

      24      at '58DD for shoreline owners.  And it was all

      25      automated the same way, with very little deviation.







                                                                   90
       1             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And then how are they

       2      going to judge the success of Plan 2014 with the

       3      environment?

       4             Are you going to say we got more

       5      Northern Pike, and that's a success?

       6             And the costs of that, I guess, that's a hard

       7      thing for us, at least get my arms around, is,

       8      obviously, because, potential, it would be very

       9      costly to the property owners along the lake, and

      10      what the return benefit.

      11             And it's great to have, I think we're all

      12      environmentalists.  We would love to have more fish

      13      and wildlife, and everything, but, is it worth the

      14      cost?

      15             So what -- what's going into that plan?

      16             BILL WERICK:  It's always going to be

      17      controversial because you can't monetize all

      18      environmental benefits.

      19             I mean, some you can.  Some you just can't.

      20             I mean, there will be some environmental

      21      benefits that will probably translate to real

      22      economic benefits.

      23             But we will try to at least quantify.

      24             So what we've been doing for 10 years, is

      25      sending biologists out into the field to actually







                                                                   91
       1      measure how much of the wetlands are covered by

       2      different types of plants.

       3             So continuing to gather evidence to see

       4      whether or not wetlands change as we expected them

       5      to.

       6             Both the Corps of Engineers and New York

       7      State DEC have gone out, and they've measured the

       8      top elevations of shore-protection structures along

       9      the south shore, because we want to make sure that

      10      our models actually predicted the failure of

      11      shore-protection structures correctly.

      12             And now with the damage reporting that we're

      13      doing with Cornell and New York Sea Grant, we'll

      14      actually try to see whether our damage estimates

      15      were reasonable.

      16             Beyond that, we're trying to encourage even

      17      broader monitoring.  The Northern Pike is one

      18      example.

      19             I think that there are efforts underway

      20      by the State University of New York to count

      21      Northern Pike.

      22             And we'll try to compare those to what they

      23      would be in other years, to see whether we're really

      24      getting a benefit or not.

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you.







                                                                   92
       1             BILL WERICK:  We'll try to produce the

       2      evidence.

       3             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Good.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Did you say earlier that

       5      response was part of Plan 2014, a response to

       6      flooding?

       7             BILL WERICK:  Yes.

       8             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I guess I would ask, did

       9      anybody come to the local areas to prepare them for

      10      what they might see, or what the extremes would be,

      11      so they weren't taken by surprise?

      12             Because I know most of the people here

      13      thought there was, maybe, a two-week period they

      14      were gonna have to live with the high water, and

      15      possibly they could get through it.  But it lasted

      16      all summer until Labor Day.

      17             So I'm just wondering, did anybody prepare

      18      them for what the plan was going to mean to the

      19      people who live here?

      20             BILL WERICK:  You know, we could always do

      21      better.

      22             And not knowing what the future would bring

      23      limited the ability for us to forewarn people.

      24             But I -- and I'm not on the board, but I did

      25      watch modern tools, like Facebook.







                                                                   93
       1             There was a lot of advertising of this, and

       2      so I think a lot of people in the audience were

       3      watching Facebook and saw this as it rolled out.

       4             Personally, I think that if we could make the

       5      connections with the community to work with the

       6      Great Lakes Adaptive Management Committee, that we

       7      could establish better networks.

       8             In our experience, communication works better

       9      if you talk to community networks that already

      10      exist.  And we need to establish those.

      11             So any help we can get with that, we would

      12      appreciate.

      13             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Okay.

      14             Thank you.

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  What were the estimates of

      16      damage that the IJC considered in coming up with

      17      Plan 2014?

      18             BILL WERICK:  For Plan 2014, we had a model

      19      that looked at damages to shore-protection

      20      structures, to first-floor flooding in homes, and to

      21      erosion of unprotected parcels that had buildings on

      22      them.

      23             And this had never been done before.

      24             The difference in technology between 2000 and

      25      1980 was, of course, enormous.







                                                                   94
       1             So we were able to make these whole-lake

       2      estimates of how individual storm events would

       3      damage shore-protection structures, and so we had

       4      the dollar estimates.

       5             SENATOR O'MARA:  But what were the dollar

       6      estimates?

       7             BILL WERICK:  They -- I don't have them in

       8      mind, but I can get you a copy of the Plan 2014

       9      report that has actual dollar damage limits.

      10             What you would see there is that the vast

      11      majority, something like 87 percent of the damage

      12      that occurs, is to shore-protection structures.

      13             And, of course, that's one of the things

      14      we're trying to measure now, to see whether we can

      15      do better at estimating those.

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Anyone else?

      17             Thank you very much.

      18             BILL WERICK:  Thank you.

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  We're going to take a brief

      20      five-minute break.

      21             We don't want to be any longer than that.

      22                  [A recess was taken.]

      23                  [The hearing recommences.]

      24             SENATOR O'MARA:  If we could -- take your

      25      seats, please.







                                                                   95
       1             We're ready to go on with our next

       2      witness from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

       3      Lieutenant Colonel Adam Czekanski, commander of the

       4      Buffalo District.

       5             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Senator O'Mara --

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Are you being joined at this

       7      point by Mr. Forgette, or is he coming after you?

       8             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Yes, sir.

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  And we also have

      10      Craig Forgette, chief of planning management team

      11      and continuing authorities program manager for the

      12      Buffalo District of the Army Corps as well.

      13             Thank you, gentlemen, for being here.

      14             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Thank you, sir.

      15             Senator O'Mara, Senator Ritchie,

      16      Assemblyman Barclay, Assemblyman Oaks, ladies and

      17      gentlemen.

      18             I want to thank you for the invitation of

      19      inviting our team to come speak with you today.

      20             As Senator O'Mara said, my name is Lieutenant

      21      Colonel Adam Czekanski, commander of the Buffalo

      22      District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

      23             With me today is Craig Forgette, who's

      24      our planning management team chief.  And, also,

      25      Miss Bridget Brown.  She is one of our regulators







                                                                   96
       1      from our -- leading regulators out of the Auburn

       2      field office, southwest of Syracuse.

       3             And I appreciate the invitation to speak

       4      tonight.

       5             I want to cover two different areas, really,

       6      two primary areas of focus.

       7             First of all, I just want to talk briefly

       8      about the actions that the corps has been part of,

       9      with respect to response to the high water levels on

      10      Lake Ontario during these past months.

      11             But then more importantly, I want to talk

      12      about what the corps can do, moving forward.

      13             And we talk about, and you hear in the news,

      14      a lot about coastal resiliency.

      15             We like to think about, you talk about, the

      16      East Coast and the West Coast.

      17             We think about the Great Lakes, really, as

      18      the "North Coast."

      19             So it's just as important on the north coast

      20      to look at shoreline or coastal resiliency, and,

      21      really, it's important, as we move forward, to look

      22      at what can be done in the future to mitigate

      23      hazards, as we move forward.

      24             So just a very brief background, and I don't

      25      have a slide for this, but just to give everyone an







                                                                   97
       1      idea, when we talk about the Buffalo District for

       2      the Army Corps of Engineers, the Corps of Engineer

       3      districts, in general, are delineated not by

       4      political boundaries, but by watershed.

       5             So our watershed is the watershed that drains

       6      into Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence

       7      Seaway.

       8             So our boundaries go from Messina, New York,

       9      in the east, all the way out to the Ohio-Indiana

      10      state line in the west.  38,000 square miles.

      11             I bring that up because a big part of what we

      12      do is, obviously, what goes on on great -- on the

      13      lower Great Lakes.

      14             On Lake Ontario, that includes navigation.

      15             We have authority to dredge and maintain

      16      federal navigation channels, a number of

      17      recreational and commercial harbors on Lake Ontario,

      18      but also to maintain the brick-wall structures and

      19      a lot of those harbors, as you saw probably in

      20      Oswego just a couple years ago.

      21             In addition to the navigation mission, a

      22      number of other missions we have, a number of other

      23      projects we have, to include ecosystem restoration.

      24             Some of you may be familiar with the

      25      Braddock Bay project we're working on, just to the







                                                                   98
       1      west of Rochester, as one example of the work we do.

       2             Our district has been around for 160 years.

       3      And, really, for 160 years, we've had a close tie to

       4      the communities on Lake Ontario.

       5             So when the water level started to rise in

       6      April, we were very much in tune with what was going

       7      on on the ground.  And our emergency-management

       8      folks were in close coordination with the state's

       9      regional emergency-management leadership, and, also,

      10      with a number of the county emergency-management

      11      chiefs.

      12             On the 2nd of May, when the Governor declared

      13      a state of emergency in the eight counties that

      14      border Lake Ontario, we also activated our emergency

      15      operations center, and requested funding from our

      16      headquarters to support that activation, so that we

      17      could be more responsive to the collective response

      18      efforts to the high water levels on Lake Ontario.

      19             One week after doing that, the Governor

      20      formally requested assistance from the corps.

      21             Within 48 hours we were able to provide

      22      almost 200,000 sandbags for use in the communities

      23      around Lake Ontario.

      24                  [Slide show begins.]

      25             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Within 72 hours --







                                                                   99
       1      if you look on the map here, what's highlighted is,

       2      within 72 hours, we were able to launch teams --

       3      technical teams to a number of the communities who

       4      were experiencing some of the most extreme high

       5      water and flooding conditions on Lake Ontario.

       6             Those teams, during the course of the

       7      following weeks, were able to visit 17 different

       8      communities on 20 different visits, and they were

       9      able to provide assistance with respect to the flood

      10      plight.

      11             Technical assistance, as far as materials

      12      being used and techniques being used, and provided

      13      to the leadership of those communities, formal input

      14      and feedback on what was being done, and what could

      15      be done, to improve the situation.

      16             So what the corps did, again, that's in the

      17      May and June time frame, that technical assistance

      18      to these communities you see highlighted, the direct

      19      assistance with respect to sandbags.  And, also,

      20      regulatory, our regulatory branch, was very well

      21      nested with the New York State DEC.

      22             When the State DEC issued their regional

      23      general permit on the 2nd of May, we were nested

      24      with them to ensure that the process was very -- as

      25      streamlined as possible for applicants so they could







                                                                   100
       1      protect their property.

       2             And I want -- I'm going to turn it over to

       3      Bridget right now so she can speak a little more

       4      clearly, and a little more in detail, about those

       5      efforts on the regulatory front, both, initially,

       6      but also in the subsequent months, how we were

       7      nested with the DEC, and how we were very much

       8      committed to the communities in this area, to ensure

       9      that residents could protect their property as

      10      effectively as possible.

      11             Bridget.

      12             BRIDGET BROWN:  Good evening.

      13             I just wanted to mention that Lake Ontario

      14      and the St. Lawrence River are regulated under

      15      Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, as well as

      16      Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

      17             And, therefore, all work in, over, or under

      18      those waterways, including the discharge of dredge

      19      or fill material, requires a Department of the Army

      20      permit.

      21             Once the regulatory branch was made aware of

      22      the damages from the high water, we immediately

      23      activated the regulatory emergency team.

      24             In that case, we set up teams of project

      25      managers to field all the phone calls, to do site







                                                                   101
       1      visits, and to expedite permitting.

       2             The -- our nationwide permit program includes

       3      two nationwide permits.  One is Nationwide Permit 3

       4      for maintenance, and Nationwide Permit 13 for bank

       5      stabilization, which cover most of the anticipated

       6      work reasonable to confirm the high-water damage.

       7             The vast majority of those permits do not

       8      require the corps to review those before work can

       9      commence over there.

      10             So they're out and available for the public

      11      to use.

      12             We confirmed that those activities would

      13      qualify for the emergency permit that the DEC

      14      authorized for storm recovery, would also qualify

      15      for Nationwide Permit 3 and 13.

      16             So at that point, we worked in conjunction

      17      with the DEC to prepare joint application process

      18      and permit materials so that we could provide a

      19      united front.

      20             At that same time, we developed a plan to

      21      funnel all the applicants through DEC, so to ensure

      22      that only the ones that really needed to be reviewed

      23      by the corps came our way, to reduce the amount of

      24      delay that would happen during the permitting

      25      process.







                                                                   102
       1             In addition, we worked with the

       2      New York State Department of State to modify their

       3      nationwide permit coastal consistency requirements

       4      that are set on the nationwide permits, which,

       5      normally, would require individual review by the

       6      Department of State for any activities that included

       7      lakeward encroachment.

       8             Further, we also consulted with the U.S. Fish

       9      and Wildlife Service, to develop a streamlined

      10      process for any projects we have -- that may have a

      11      potential effect on endangered species.

      12             With that, we were able to allow for the

      13      endangered-species consultation process to be

      14      completed in one to two days versus the normal

      15      30-day process.

      16             So, overall, in general, it was a cooperative

      17      effort between our state and federal agencies, to

      18      try to make a very streamlined permit process, to

      19      ensure that there was very minimal red tape as

      20      possible, and to make sure that people were able to

      21      implement their protection measures as soon as

      22      possible.

      23             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Thanks, Bridget.

      24             So we're very proud of the fact that we were

      25      able to assist very quickly, and, really, along







                                                                   103
       1      with -- I want to clarify one point, that throughout

       2      this response effort and floodplain effort, we the

       3      corps was, at all times, supplementing the State-led

       4      effort.

       5             The entire time, it was led by the State of

       6      New York.  And, again, as resources were being

       7      utilized at the local level, county level, state

       8      level, the corps was supplementing that effort.

       9             I was able to visit a number of communities

      10      along the shoreline, from Ogdensburg, all the way

      11      down to Old Fort Niagara.  And so, again, I can

      12      sympathize with what was going on with respect to

      13      the high water and with respect to damage to

      14      property.

      15             And, again, we were committed to assisting as

      16      best we could throughout that effort.

      17             But now the more important part I would say

      18      is:

      19             What can we do, moving forward?

      20             What can we do, moving forward, to be more

      21      resilient?

      22             Because, as was mentioned earlier, in the

      23      earlier briefings, you know, this is bound to happen

      24      again.

      25             We don't know if it's going to be to the same







                                                                   104
       1      extent, but there will be high water again at some

       2      point.

       3             So, it's most important to look at how can we

       4      be more resilient along the Lake Ontario shoreline?

       5             And Craig's gonna talk a little bit more

       6      about that, as far as where the corps can assist.

       7             Craig.

       8             CRAIG FORGETTE:  So the corps has a number of

       9      authorities where we can help out, and do good

      10      things on Lake Ontario.

      11             And the first of these is the Streambank &

      12      Shoreline Protection Authority, and this is for

      13      public infrastructure, for significant public

      14      infrastructure.

      15             An example is this site at Western Reserve in

      16      Cleveland, Ohio.  It was completed, 775 feet of

      17      shoreline protection, which was done back in May of

      18      2005.

      19             The general scope, is for us to provide for

      20      developing and constructing streambank and shoreline

      21      protection projects for highways, bridge approaches;

      22      public-work facilities, such as water, wastewater

      23      treatment plants, sewer lines; churches, public and

      24      private and non-profit facilities.  And that's

      25      limited to a cost of $5 million, federal.







                                                                   105
       1             The -- we begin at the bottom of the slide.

       2             The first step is a letter of intent.

       3             And in the case of this flooding here on

       4      Lake Ontario, we've received three letters of intent

       5      back in May and June of 2017:

       6             One from the Town of Greece.  On

       7      Edgemere Drive, which was discussed earlier, has had

       8      a history of flooding;

       9             Also at the Golden Hills State Park

      10      Lighthouse;

      11             And the Old Fort Niagara at the French

      12      Castle.

      13             So those are just a couple of the spots that

      14      we've already received requests to help on using

      15      this authority.

      16             The first part of our process was to do a

      17      feasibility study, environmental assessment, and

      18      public involvement.

      19             Then we move on to -- and that can take about

      20      18 months, or, once from the time we get funded,

      21      maybe a little longer.

      22             And then we move into design and construction

      23      phase.

      24             That phase is cost-share.  It's 65 percent

      25      federal, 35 percent non-federal.  So there is a







                                                                   106
       1      cost-sharing requirement to this.

       2             But this is just one way that we can work to

       3      help solve some of the problems along the coastline,

       4      to help prevent further damage from future flooding.

       5             Another authority we have is the planning

       6      assistance to states and tribes.

       7             These are non-structural solutions; meaning,

       8      that it's not something that we're ever going to

       9      design and construct.  But it's -- some examples

      10      are:  Water-quality studies, wetland-evaluation

      11      studies, floodplain-management studies, coastal-zone

      12      management, harbor and port studies, or any other

      13      water-resource planning investigation that may be

      14      valid.

      15             We -- those are cost-shared, 50 percent

      16      federal, 50 percent non-federal, and has a maximum

      17      of $2 million per state or federal funds for these

      18      studies.

      19             Again, these are not things that we can

      20      design and construct, but we can certainly provide

      21      support and the factors I just discussed.

      22             And then one other way that we can help -- so

      23      those are kind of mid-term solutions, things that we

      24      can do to help on specific locations.

      25             But in taking a broader approach and looking







                                                                   107
       1      at things on a larger scale across the Great Lakes

       2      or across Lake Ontario, there's a proposal out for a

       3      Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study.  And, it can

       4      certainly look at the things we just talked about,

       5      that would be done on a specific site-by-site

       6      location.  But this is trying looking at things

       7      across Lake Ontario or a Great Lakes-wide approach.

       8             You know, all the things that we've been

       9      talking about today, lake-level fluctuations,

      10      changes in rain patterns, coastal storms, the

      11      agricultural and stormwater runoffs, and invasive

      12      species, and even aging infrastructure, some of the

      13      flood-control structure -- or, the storm damage --

      14      the breakwalls, all the other things that we've

      15      built, are getting older and may need repairs.

      16             So this is a way to look at coastal

      17      resiliency.

      18             How do -- what's the ability of coastal areas

      19      to withstand, recover from, and adapt to changes,

      20      while making sure that we take a look at the

      21      economic, environmental, social, and cultural

      22      values?

      23             So, balancing all of those things out --

      24      looking at those problems, and trying to look at a

      25      holistic approach across all of those factors on







                                                                   108
       1      Lake Ontario -- is a goal of the study.

       2             We look at an array of measures, a spectrum

       3      of things, everything from:

       4             Those structural-type components, whether

       5      it's armoring, or putting more stone in;

       6             Non-structural, meaning, we're not going to

       7      build a real structure, but we may do dredging, or

       8      add sand, or look at how the sand moves through the

       9      system;

      10             To just doing wetland or plantings, and those

      11      types of activities;

      12             To just land-use planning.

      13             So all of those will be looked at as part of

      14      this study.

      15             We've received letters of intent from all of

      16      the Great Lakes states to work towards this, and

      17      this is something we would be working through,

      18      through our investigations authority.

      19             And we've requested federal funds to move out

      20      on this effort.

      21             Are there any other questions for us?

      22             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Can you tell me how many

      24      permit applications you received?

      25             BRIDGET BROWN:  I don't have the -- a number







                                                                   109
       1      on that at this point, because, again, a lot of it

       2      was funneled through the DEC, to kind of get that

       3      first tier out of there.  And then we are still

       4      receiving applications.

       5             One issue for a regulatory permitting is

       6      that, because the water was high, not a lot of

       7      assessment could be done to what damage was there,

       8      and to figure out exactly what needed to be done.

       9             So our bigger lift of permit applications

      10      will be coming.  So we're expecting that to be

      11      coming, you know, after the waters go down and

      12      people starting assessing, and figuring out what

      13      they can do.

      14             And we'll be seeing the applications rise at

      15      that point.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Do you have a large request

      17      for people who have no shoreline stabilization in

      18      place, now looking to do that?

      19             BRIDGET BROWN:  Yes.

      20             Yes, we're getting lots of requests in.

      21             We do lots of site visits to take a look at

      22      those things.

      23             And, yeah, so there are people who are now

      24      looking at those measures.

      25             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So the corps will go out







                                                                   110
       1      and make recommendations of what should be done?

       2             BRIDGET BROWN:  We don't necessarily make

       3      recommendations, what should be done.  But we're

       4      assessing what they're proposing to do, to see what

       5      types of permits that was to require.

       6             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Okay.

       7             Thank you.

       8             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I don't have any

       9      questions.

      10             I just want to say, thank you.

      11             I've heard from many of my constituents, and

      12      from municipalities, how great the corps has been

      13      through this.

      14             So thank you for what you've done so far.

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  Bob.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Nothing for them.

      17             Go ahead.

      18             SENATOR O'MARA:  Did the corps have any

      19      involvement in the formulation of Plan 2014?

      20             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  No, sir.

      21             I mean, we have members who are part of the

      22      board of the -- International Lake Ontario and

      23      St. Lawrence River Board.

      24             But as far as actual formulation, we were not

      25      directly involved with that.







                                                                   111
       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you have any estimate of

       2      what the Army Corps has expended as a result of the

       3      extensive flooding this year along Lake Ontario?

       4             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  I don't have a

       5      figure with me, sir.

       6             But, again, we did receive supplemental funds

       7      from our headquarters, specifically for our

       8      involvement with response to the flood event.

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      10             Thank you very much for being here today.

      11             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Thank you, sir.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next up, we have

      13      Mr. Ken Lynch, executive deputy commissioner from

      14      the New York State Department of Environmental

      15      Conservation.

      16             KENNETH LYNCH:  Good evening, Senator O'Mara,

      17      Senator Ritchie, Assemblyman Barclay, and

      18      Assemblyman Oaks.

      19             Thank you for the opportunity to discuss

      20      the serious issue of this year's flooding along

      21      Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River.

      22             And I also want to personally thank you for

      23      bringing me back to my home region for tonight.

      24             My name is Ken Lynch.  I'm the executive

      25      deputy commissioner for New York State Department of







                                                                   112
       1      Environmental Conservation.

       2             Commissioner Seggos sends his regrets that he

       3      could not be here today.

       4             I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the

       5      State's approach to addressing these impacts, and

       6      how to make our shorelines and neighborhoods more

       7      resilient.

       8             This spring, New Yorkers living along

       9      Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River faced the

      10      devastating impacts of a slow-moving disaster,

      11      ultimately resulting in record-level water levels

      12      according to NOAA data.

      13             Heavy rainfall and snow melt throughout the

      14      Great Lakes system caused flooding that inundated

      15      houses and docks; eroded dunes, bluffs, and

      16      backyards; threatened wastewater infrastructure in

      17      low-lying areas; and flooded streets.

      18             Based on a close scrutiny of the facts and

      19      science, it appears that the International Joint

      20      Commission, which manages Plan 2014 and determines

      21      the water levels of Lake Ontario and the

      22      St. Lawrence River, exacerbated the impacts of high

      23      water levels by failing to increase outflows from

      24      the lake, and by not properly using the flexibility

      25      they have within their authority.







                                                                   113
       1             The IJC's actions over the course of the

       2      spring and summer clearly illustrated that they

       3      favored the interest of commercial waterborne

       4      shipping interests over the homeowners, businesses,

       5      and municipalities along both sides of the boundary

       6      waters.

       7             Such an action exacerbated the suffering of

       8      the people who live and work along the lake and

       9      river, particularly New Yorkers on the south side of

      10      the system who faced more erosion and flooding due

      11      to the system's hydraulics.

      12             As flooding levels reached the peak,

      13      Governor Cuomo took swift and decisive actions to

      14      help communities cope with the -- this emergency,

      15      and recover from the damage caused by this

      16      historically high water levels.

      17             Beginning in early May, before water levels

      18      had reached their peak, Governor Cuomo,

      19      Commissioner Seggos, Department of Homeland Security

      20      and Emergency Services Commissioner Parrino, and

      21      other state officials, including myself, were on the

      22      scene of flooded properties along Lake Ontario and

      23      the St. Lawrence River to review firsthand the

      24      devastation that these high water levels were

      25      causing.







                                                                   114
       1             The Governor stood up for our waterfront

       2      communities and demonstrated his commitment through

       3      several bold actions since day one.

       4             And both the Governor and commissioners have

       5      upheld our responsibility to assist these

       6      communities, repeatedly visiting this area, to

       7      ensure people receive the help they need.

       8             Recognizing the gravity and the extent of

       9      this emergency, Governor Cuomo issued Executive

      10      Order Number 165 on May 2, 2017, which declared a

      11      disaster for counties bordering Lake Ontario and the

      12      St. Lawrence River, and directed state agencies,

      13      including DEC, to assist the people and local

      14      governments affected by it.

      15             Since that time, the State has deployed

      16      New York State emergency response mobile command

      17      centers to provide swift aid to people in need of

      18      assistance in dealing with floodwaters, including

      19      one here in Mexico, implementing the Lake Ontario

      20      Flood Assistance Hotline to help people with

      21      insurance-related issues; assist homeowners with

      22      flood-mitigation measures, such as sand bags, and

      23      help them obtain technical guidance regarding

      24      on-site repairs to property.

      25             We expedited and streamlines permits to







                                                                   115
       1      enable property owners to quickly undertake

       2      projects.

       3             To date, we have issued 93 emergency

       4      authorizations, nearly 1,300 general permits, and

       5      more than 400 individual permits, for projects to

       6      protect and restore the shoreline.

       7             DEC also completed more than

       8      300 coastal-erosion hazard area inspections.

       9             The State deployed nearly 1.6 million

      10      sandbags to protect the properties of residents and

      11      businesses, as well as temporary removable dam

      12      systems in the town of Greece and the village of

      13      Sodus Point.

      14             We provided 1 million for emergency repairs

      15      and upgrades to wastewater treatment systems in

      16      Sodus Point and Greece.

      17             We requested, and received, assistance from

      18      federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of

      19      Engineers and U.S. Geological Survey.

      20             We imposed a 5-mile-per-hour speed limit to

      21      control damaging wakes within 600 feet of Lake

      22      Ontario and the St. Lawrence shoreline.

      23             With your support, we made $45 million

      24      available to municipalities, homeowners, and small

      25      businesses to repair the damage caused by sustained







                                                                   116
       1      flooding.

       2             And, we called upon President Trump to

       3      provide federal disaster relief to this beleaguered

       4      region, and demanded that he replace the current

       5      U.S. IJC members.

       6             New York's swift, comprehensive, and

       7      effective efforts to address the high water levels

       8      demonstrate our ability to quickly respond to

       9      emergency situations.

      10             The water levels experienced this year

      11      throughout the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River

      12      system are among the highest ever recorded.

      13             Waves created by strong winds intensified the

      14      impacts of the water levels to the detriment of

      15      properties along Lake Ontario's southern and eastern

      16      shores.

      17             The impact on these communities was

      18      staggering, as Governor Cuomo and other

      19      administration officials saw during their tours of

      20      the region.

      21             I visited lake communities on several

      22      occasions myself, to help address area needs with

      23      our regional staff.

      24             And I just want to take a moment to recognize

      25      some of many regional staff that worked on this







                                                                   117
       1      project in this area, led by Regional Director

       2      Matt Marko;

       3             His regional permit administrator,

       4      Dave Bimber, who was in all of our communities,

       5      helping people with permits, together with his

       6      staff;

       7             Our information officer, Stephanie Webb, who

       8      got a lot of the information out to the public, and

       9      made sure they were educated on what programs we had

      10      to offer;

      11             And, Tim Walsh, who was our lead technical

      12      assistant, helping property owners with protective

      13      measures along the shoreline.

      14             During his tenure, Governor Cuomo has

      15      witnessed flooding in many parts of the state, and

      16      he recognized that these natural disasters are the

      17      reality of living in a water-rich state, exacerbated

      18      by climate change.

      19             Statewide, the Governor has directed state

      20      agencies to take actions that are making flood-prone

      21      regions more resilient to future storms.

      22             Our challenge now is to address the impacts

      23      of climate change and more frequent flooding on the

      24      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River shoreline.

      25             We all acknowledge that high water levels







                                                                   118
       1      have occurred before on the lake and river.

       2             They devastated the region this year, and we

       3      must plan for their reality that water levels will

       4      rise and fall again.

       5             It is essential that we work closely with all

       6      levels of government to prepare for future flooding

       7      by making the region as resilient as possible.

       8             Already, DEC and our sister agencies

       9      have opened up a dialogue with the Army Corps

      10      of Engineers, FEMA, USGS, and EPA on new

      11      short- and long-term activities to make the

      12      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River shoreline more

      13      resilient to future storms and flood events.

      14             While this discussion follows the pattern we

      15      developed in response to the state's recovery from

      16      other natural disasters, the solutions developed

      17      must be uniquely suited to the needs of this river

      18      region.

      19             To do so, we are exploring measures to help

      20      reduce and mitigate the impacts of flooding if water

      21      levels, again, are again high in the near future,

      22      and longer-term measures to make the shoreline more

      23      resilient to flooding.

      24             Based on our experience with coastal storms,

      25      such as "Superstorm Sandy," we recognize that







                                                                   119
       1      natural features can improve shoreline resiliency;

       2      for example, wetlands act as natural sponges to

       3      absorb floodwaters and protect property, and are

       4      particularly helpful in urban areas.

       5             Where natural features are less likely to be

       6      effective, we will work with our federal partners to

       7      develop structural measures to protect both people

       8      and property.

       9             Should the federal government issue the

      10      disaster declaration the Governor requested in July,

      11      we will work with local governments to help rebuild

      12      smarter and more resilient.

      13             We are also working closely with the Army

      14      Corps to evaluate additional permanent steps to

      15      protect and prepare for future high water levels and

      16      flooding.

      17             Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the

      18      State's response to the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence

      19      River corridor flooding this year, and we look

      20      forward to working with you to advance needed

      21      resiliency measures in the near future.

      22             I'll take any questions.

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you, Mr. Lynch.

      24             Assemblyman Oaks.

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Yes.







                                                                   120
       1             Deputy Commissioner, I was just, both with

       2      the Army Corps' presentation and then yours, you

       3      talked about resiliency issues and, in essence,

       4      trying to provide more protection to current

       5      shoreline.

       6             Some of the areas along the lake are publicly

       7      owned.

       8             Port Bay, for instance, has a barrier bar.

       9      It's had a breach in it.  It was fixed.  But then we

      10      had a new breach this year.  And, so, efforts trying

      11      to make that more secure, to protect some of the

      12      bays or the properties off Lake Ontario.

      13             There's other ones that may be publicly

      14      owned, and also that may be privately owned; for

      15      instance, Crescent Beach barrier bar for Sodus Bay

      16      is all privately owned.

      17             The question I guess I would ask both, you

      18      know, of yourself and the department and the corps

      19      is:

      20             Is there -- I can see using public dollars,

      21      and the legitimacy of that of protecting those

      22      publicly-owned barrier areas.

      23             But, also, I think there's been a strong case

      24      made, even for some of the privately owned, not

      25      necessarily for the protection of the individual







                                                                   121
       1      property that's privately owned, but the property on

       2      the other side in the bay.

       3             Is there any definitive type of policy on

       4      that which could show strengthening, or using public

       5      dollars for barrier bars that protect our bays along

       6      Lake Ontario?

       7             KENNETH LYNCH:  Yeah, and I think we've heard

       8      tonight that it is much more difficult to find

       9      specific funding for private-property owners and

      10      private protection.

      11             Although, I will say, you and the Governor

      12      have already found an exception to that with the

      13      45 million ways to help those individual property

      14      owners.

      15             There is no definitive prohibition or

      16      allowance of that type of activity.

      17             I think in this case we need to be creative.

      18             Obviously, it's easier to construct on public

      19      property, with public entities joining the state and

      20      federal government to help fund and construct those

      21      projects.

      22             But I think if we can find a connection

      23      between private work and public protection, there

      24      may be ways to fund those projects also with public

      25      money.







                                                                   122
       1             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Most of your remarks

       2      tonight were on resiliency, the issues of things

       3      that you did, obviously, in relation to this year's

       4      flooding challenges.

       5             They didn't go directly to challenging or

       6      changing, you know, policy that may, you know,

       7      lessen that in the future.

       8             In other words, some -- we -- earlier

       9      speakers we've talked about, who were talking about,

      10      specifically, Plan 2014, or answering questions

      11      along that.

      12             I guess I would focus on, one, was -- did

      13      DEC, as an agency, take a stand or provide public

      14      direction on Plan 2014 before it was adopted?

      15             KENNETH LYNCH:  We did not take a formal

      16      position on 2014.

      17             We were out in the community, listening to

      18      concerns.

      19             We heard a lot about the environmental

      20      benefits that 2014 provided.

      21             We also heard a lot about the concerns that

      22      property owners had, especially in this area, about

      23      the potential impacts.

      24             We passed those messages on to the federal

      25      government as part of the process, but the plan







                                                                   123
       1      itself was adopted by the federal government.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Is there a role now, do

       3      you think, for state government to take a reaction?

       4             I know the Governor made some comments about,

       5      you know, how it was this specific crisis was

       6      handled, or, how it might have been created,

       7      et cetera.

       8             Is there -- is it appropriate now for the

       9      State to push, perhaps, more strongly of future --

      10      as we look at what any future issues might be, that

      11      encourage changes and/or any alternatives to the

      12      existing plan?

      13             KENNETH LYNCH:  Well, again, it's a federal

      14      plan, so we don't have a direct input into it.

      15             But, certainly, I think there's always an

      16      opportunity for us to participate with both our

      17      federal, state, and local partners, to lend our

      18      position and our perspective, representing the

      19      people of the state of New York, towards changing or

      20      adapting plans.

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Thank you.

      22             SENATOR RITCHIE:  First, I would like to

      23      thank you and the Commissioner and your department

      24      for being on the ground with the Assemblymen and

      25      I at the workshops, and trying to help to turn







                                                                   124
       1      permits around as quickly as possible, along with

       2      the Army Corps.

       3             The Army Corps was very helpful also.

       4             When you opened up, you did say that either

       5      the Governor or the department had beliefs that the

       6      IJC did not act soon enough.

       7             Given what we heard during the first two

       8      testimonies, saying that they don't believe that

       9      would have changed, I think the consensus in this

      10      room is that we all believe that, maybe, if water

      11      would have been increased during the outflow, some

      12      of the damage may not have happened.

      13             Can you give us some information that would

      14      help refute what was told during the first two

      15      testimonies?

      16             KENNETH LYNCH:  Well, I -- you know, the

      17      issue of when releases should have begun, and

      18      whether or not the plan allowed that flexibility, is

      19      debatable.

      20             But I think what's very clear is that, once

      21      releases started, and we reached certain thresholds,

      22      that there was a clear requirement to balance the

      23      various perspectives.

      24             The Governor was very clear and the

      25      Commissioner was very clear that the most important







                                                                   125
       1      aspect that should have been balanced were the

       2      property owners.

       3             And I think that is part of the plan.

       4             We heard a lot about shipping interests, and

       5      we couldn't increase the flows because of shipping

       6      interests.

       7             The Governor and Commissioner were clear that

       8      the interests of the property owners should come

       9      first.

      10             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And do you believe that the

      11      interests of Montreal was taken, potentially, at a

      12      higher level than the people in this district?

      13             KENNETH LYNCH:  Well, certainly, there were

      14      flooding impacts downstream too.

      15             But I think the Commissioner's and Governor's

      16      point was that, IJC, just don't look at downstream,

      17      just don't just look at shipping interests.

      18             We have a lot going on here on the shores of

      19      Lake Ontario and New York State that you have to

      20      also be very aware of, and give that as strong, if

      21      not more, consideration, certainly, than some of the

      22      other interests.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Will you be making a --

      24      some kind of presentation to the federal government,

      25      or at least sending on a letter, asking them to take







                                                                   126
       1      a look at this?

       2             KENNETH LYNCH:  Well, both the Commissioner

       3      and Governor have already sent letters in respect to

       4      our position that more should have been done.

       5             And I would anticipate that, going forward,

       6      we will work with the IJC to have them better

       7      address the situation in advance of it occurring

       8      again.

       9             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And can you just give me an

      10      update on the dunes in the Sandy Pond area, where

      11      we're at with the dunes there?

      12             KENNETH LYNCH:  As you know, Senator, we flew

      13      the dune area, at least on two days, with our new

      14      drone technology.  We got some great footage.

      15             We helped state parks do improvements and

      16      stabilization to their property, which, in turn,

      17      protected some of the residents behind that.

      18             We've worked closely with several property

      19      owners in the Sandy Pond area to get their permits

      20      so they can protect their shoreline.

      21             We also put out a fact sheet, with some

      22      guidance to property owners on how they can help

      23      protect their shorelines, and talking about both

      24      hardening the shoreline and resiliency projects to

      25      protect it over the long term.







                                                                   127
       1             The dunes are very dynamic.  They change

       2      every year whether there's flooding or not.

       3             But we're here to offer our technical

       4      guidance, and work specifically with, not just

       5      private-property owners, but the communities in the

       6      Sandy Pond area, to see if we can get better

       7      protection of those dunes.

       8             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

       9             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thanks for being here.

      10             I just want to echo the Senator's comments

      11      about how well Dave Bimber and region -- Matt did

      12      with the permitting.

      13             I know Dave worked a lot of weekends and late

      14      at night, and they really were very responsive.

      15             So we appreciate that.

      16             I don't have any real questions, Ken.

      17             The only thing I would just mention, if the

      18      department or the Governor would come out publicly

      19      against 2014, I think that would help our cause

      20      immensely.

      21             I know, during the whole process, we didn't

      22      hear much from state government.  And I know he does

      23      have the property owners in the southern and eastern

      24      part of Lake Ontario, their interests, at heart.

      25             So it would be nice to hear from him publicly







                                                                   128
       1      about Plan 2014.

       2             KENNETH LYNCH:  Okay.  I'll take that back,

       3      Assemblyman.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you.

       5             SENATOR O'MARA:  Ken, can you touch on the

       6      fact that we have approved, between -- negotiations

       7      between the State Legislature and the Governor for

       8      this $45 million to be expended for relief and

       9      damages, why there has been no FEMA declaration for

      10      the damages in this flooding incident?

      11             KENNETH LYNCH:  Yeah, I mean, the Governor

      12      made the request, I believe in June, or July, for

      13      that declaration.

      14             We have not seen that yet.

      15             I know (indiscernible) is working closely

      16      with the Governor's Office on putting together all

      17      of our damages.

      18             But, I'm not intimately familiar with the

      19      status of that, but we have not heard back

      20      definitively from FEMA at this point.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you -- can you -- are you

      22      in a position here tonight to outline what damages

      23      we've seen at our state parks along the shoreline?

      24             I know Senator Ritchie just touched on

      25      Sandy Island State Park, but, there's many others as







                                                                   129
       1      well.

       2             And, can you touch on what damages resulted

       3      at other parks?

       4             And, also, what the impact of this flooding

       5      was on the activity at those parks this summer?

       6             The campgrounds, was usage down, were state

       7      revenue down, because of the flooding issues that we

       8      had?

       9             KENNETH LYNCH:  Yeah, I don't have any of

      10      those specific numbers for our sister agency.

      11             But I do know, and I mentioned Sandy Pond,

      12      and the impact that the nearby park had, and the

      13      erosion of the shoreline and the considerable work

      14      they had to do there.

      15             I was in Fair Haven with the Senator,

      16      I believe, one day, and watching the bank erode from

      17      that small state park in Fair Haven.

      18             I know the damage was significant.

      19             I do know that, certainly, usage was down

      20      because of the flooding, not only state parks, but

      21      DEC had to close some of our boat launches, for

      22      safety reasons, because the water was so high.  Just

      23      didn't know what was under the water, so we couldn't

      24      have people launching in certain areas.  We tried to

      25      keep as many open as possible.







                                                                   130
       1             So, it was considerable across the state.

       2             And I'm sure state parks could provide you

       3      with some more detail.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  Which is one of the reasons

       5      I wanted state parks to be here tonight, but

       6      somebody else had another idea on that.

       7             So, on the wetlands, and the higher levels of

       8      wetlands, good environmental purposes, but, you

       9      know, we've seen a lot of damage around the lake

      10      this year, not just from the direct lake waves

      11      hitting, but coming around from behind, in a lot of

      12      cases, from these elevated wetlands.

      13             KENNETH LYNCH:  Uh-huh.

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  What is the department

      15      doing, or looking at, in regards to how to mitigate

      16      those types of damages, coming in from behind, so to

      17      speak?

      18             KENNETH LYNCH:  Yeah, you know, it's really

      19      the same approach that we use from the lakeshore,

      20      although, you don't have as many of the hardening

      21      interests that you have on the backside.

      22             But, certainly, you try to find those

      23      resilient measures, that you can build natural

      24      barriers to protect the individual property owners

      25      while, at the same time, preserving the integrity of







                                                                   131
       1      the wetland, and making the connections between the

       2      lake and the wetland as fluid as possible, if you

       3      will, so that, you know, you don't have restricted

       4      activity that will cause water to go in other

       5      directions; for example, to neighboring properties.

       6             So, it's looking holistically at the design

       7      and improvements to those wetlands, to make sure you

       8      can get the benefits of those wetland areas while,

       9      at the same time, protect private property.

      10             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      11             KENNETH LYNCH:  All right.

      12             Thanks for having me.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next up, we have Chris Leo,

      14      acting president of New York State Homes and

      15      Community Renewal.

      16             CHRIS LEO:  Good evening, Senator O'Mara,

      17      Senator Ritchie, Assemblyman Barclay, and

      18      Assemblyman Oaks.

      19             On behalf of Governor Cuomo and

      20      Commissioner Visnauskas, I am pleased to offer this

      21      testimony regarding New York State Homes and

      22      Community Renewal's response to the Lake Ontario

      23      2017 flooding.

      24             In the spring of 2017, the southern coast of

      25      Lake Ontario experienced historic flooding, with the







                                                                   132
       1      lake rising 30 inches above normal levels.

       2             The flooding impacted the counties of Cayuga,

       3      Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego,

       4      St. Lawrence, and Wayne.

       5             The Governor immediately recognized the

       6      impact that this flooding would have on the region's

       7      residents and businesses.

       8             On May 2, 2017, the Governor declared a state

       9      of emergency and deployed the National Guard and

      10      other state resources to help deal with the impacts

      11      of the flooding.

      12             As the impact on homeowners came into

      13      specific focus, Governor Cuomo announced the

      14      availability of $7 million for homeowners impacted

      15      by flooding on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence

      16      River, and directed HCR to develop programs to help

      17      residents rebuild their homes.

      18             At the same time, Governor Cuomo also

      19      announced $10 million in support for public

      20      infrastructure repairs and $5 million in support for

      21      small businesses.

      22             HCR subsequently tasked its Affordable

      23      Housing Corporation to assist with its response.

      24             Through AHC, HCR deployed state resources to

      25      help qualified homeowners to purchase and repair







                                                                   133
       1      their homes.

       2             AHC's operating model is to contract with

       3      local not-for-profit corporations to conduct

       4      community outreach, help with applications,

       5      determine eligibility, suggest contractors, verify

       6      construction, among the many services that they

       7      offer.

       8             For this initiative, AHC issued a request for

       9      proposals.  We evaluated submissions, and selected

      10      the following not-for-profit organizations to

      11      administer the program:

      12             Sheen Housing, covering Cayuga, Monroe, and

      13      Wayne counties;

      14             Niagara Falls Neighborhood Housings Services

      15      in Niagara County;

      16             Pathstone in Orleans County;

      17             And Neighbors of Watertown in Jefferson,

      18      Huron, Oswego, and St. Lawrence counties.

      19             Each of these not-for-profit organizations is

      20      a pillar of their local communities, with the

      21      expertise and a wide range of state and federal

      22      housing and community-development programs.

      23             Thanks to the Governor's and the

      24      Legislature's bipartisan efforts, the Lake Ontario

      25      Relief Bill was passed, and signed by the Governor







                                                                   134
       1      on July 6, 2017, making a total of 15 million

       2      available to local homeowners impacted by the flood.

       3             Homeowners that sustained flood-related

       4      damage are eligible to receive up to $50,000 in

       5      reimbursements for eligible losses, including for

       6      repairs to and restoration of structures, equipment,

       7      and other physical damage.

       8             Throughout the application period, which

       9      concluded on September 29th, the not-for-profit

      10      organizations conducted extensive outreach to ensure

      11      that communities were aware of the resources made

      12      available.

      13             The not-for-profits participated in a total

      14      of nearly 50 public meetings and town halls to share

      15      information, answer questions, and provide

      16      application assistance.

      17             We recognize that this is a difficult time as

      18      communities work to rebuild.

      19             The not-for-profits continue to review and

      20      process applications as expeditiously as possible.

      21             We encourage homeowners to reach out to their

      22      local not-for-profit organizations with questions

      23      about their applications.

      24             The Governor is committed to ensuring that

      25      communities have the resources they need to complete







                                                                   135
       1      their repairs.

       2             Last week, the Governor and the Legislature

       3      announced that all necessary funding will be

       4      available to support eligible homeowners,

       5      businesses, and communities, and we will continue to

       6      work hand in hand with our colleagues across state

       7      government, including Empire State Development, the

       8      Division of Homeland Security and Emergency

       9      Services, and the Department of Environmental

      10      Conservation, financial services, and tax and

      11      finance, to ensure a comprehensive whole of

      12      government response.

      13             We are also grateful to our colleagues in

      14      local government at the front lines of this

      15      response, and continue to work closely with them to

      16      ensure that they have the resources they need to

      17      respond effectively.

      18             Thank you again for the opportunity to

      19      testify in this important matter.

      20             We share your commitment to helping these

      21      communities rebuild, and we look forward to working

      22      with you in the months ahead.

      23             I'd be happy to take any questions that you

      24      might have.

      25







                                                                   136
       1             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

       2             Go ahead.

       3             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you.

       4             How many -- do you know the number of

       5      applications that were submitted?

       6             CHRIS LEO:  Yeah.

       7             The application deadline was September 29th,

       8      which was recently.

       9             We received, roughly, 3400 applications.  And

      10      there was a big uptick as the deadline was amplified

      11      towards the end of the program.

      12             So these applications are now being reviewed

      13      by the not-for-profits.

      14             We do expect that number to drop maybe a

      15      little bit, as we suspect that some of the final

      16      applications that were submitted may or may not be

      17      eligible.

      18             So, thirty-four is a rough number.

      19             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  You know, I understand,

      20      when we did the legislation, with all legislation,

      21      there gets to be holes, that you don't see it when

      22      you're writing it.  And we rely on, obviously, the

      23      agencies to kind of fill in some of the, you know,

      24      spaces that inevitably occur with legislation.

      25             I -- I've had a lot of people reach out to my







                                                                   137
       1      office that have manufactured homes on leased

       2      property.

       3             CHRIS LEO:  Uh-huh.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  They're not eligible,

       5      is your understanding, for this type of relief that

       6      we're providing?

       7             CHRIS LEO:  Yeah, that's my understanding, is

       8      that we need -- we are looking for ownership of the

       9      unit and the land to qualify for --

      10             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Some of these have very

      11      long-term leases.  You know, it's not -- it's almost

      12      like they do own it.

      13             CHRIS LEO:  Oh, like a 99-year lease?

      14             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Yeah.  Leases --

      15             CHRIS LEO:  Yeah, yeah.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  -- right.

      17             So is there a way to relook at that, maybe?

      18             CHRIS LEO:  Yes, we can certainly --

      19             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I can do it more

      20      formally in a letter, telling you, specifically, the

      21      issues and where they are?

      22             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  But -- if you would be

      24      willing to look at that, because I think, if you

      25      read the legislation, they may or may not have been







                                                                   138
       1      included in there.

       2             But I think, when the regulations came out,

       3      or -- you know, I don't know if they're official

       4      regulations, whatever your decision-making on it,

       5      they got left out.

       6             So I would appreciate that.

       7             CHRIS LEO:  Absolutely.

       8             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  The only other thing,

       9      and it's not maybe a question, but it's more of a

      10      comment:

      11             I hope -- you know, when we talk about

      12      Plan 2014, and some of the winners and losers in

      13      this whole thing, I hope you're coordinating with,

      14      and you mentioned ESDC, and just the total cost out

      15      there.

      16             And -- is there any hope that there's going

      17      to be a report at the end of this about -- so we can

      18      really track how much damage was done --

      19             CHRIS LEO:  Sure.

      20             We're still processing, and we won't know the

      21      tally on the homeowners' side.  That will become

      22      clearer first.

      23             The application deadlines for the municipal

      24      infrastructure program and the ESD small-business

      25      program are at the end of December.







                                                                   139
       1             So I would expect that it would be at that

       2      time that, you know, the cost would be -- come into

       3      greater focus.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  And you mentioned the

       5      fact that the Governor is trying to reach agreement

       6      to add more money to this program.

       7             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

       8             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Do -- can you opine on

       9      how much money is needed?

      10             CHRIS LEO:  Well, based on our estimates for

      11      the homeowner portion, I believe that the total of

      12      $50 million, so that would be what we have already,

      13      plus the additional funding that I believe was

      14      agreed to by the Legislature.

      15             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  So you're comfortable

      16      with that?

      17             CHRIS LEO:  I am comfortable with that

      18      number.

      19             We've been having weekly meetings with the

      20      not-for-profits, and we're almost getting live-time

      21      reporting on kind of what the damage estimates are.

      22             So we're fairly confident with that number.

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.

      24             Thank you.

      25             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Can you tell me how many







                                                                   140
       1      applications have been funded up to this point out

       2      of the 3400?  Do you have that number with you?

       3             CHRIS LEO:  Out of the, roughly,

       4      3400 applications that we've received, right now

       5      I would say just over 60 percent have been reviewed

       6      and processed by the not-for-profits.

       7             They've conducted, roughly, 1,000 site

       8      visits.

       9             And we are looking, so far, at disbursements,

      10      roughly, $3 million to date.

      11             You know, as the application deadline

      12      approached, the not-for-profits had to focus their

      13      resources on actually processing the applications.

      14             So we fully expect them now to pivot towards

      15      recovery, to see the rate of expenditures increase.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I know in the beginning you

      17      were focusing on primary homes --

      18             CHRIS LEO:  Uh-huh.

      19             SENATOR RITCHIE:  -- which, of course, is

      20      something that's critical.

      21             CHRIS LEO:  Absolutely.

      22             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Because we were all worried

      23      that there was not going to be enough funds in

      24      place.

      25             Now, with last Friday's announcement, will







                                                                   141
       1      you start looking at secondary homes, and also

       2      shoreline stabilization, to be funded at the same

       3      time, instead of putting them further down the list?

       4             CHRIS LEO:  Sure, absolutely.

       5             In regards to prioritization, obviously,

       6      primary homes, where it was an issue of habitability

       7      of the home, would be a top priority.

       8             But as far as lakeshore hardening, if that

       9      proved to be an imminent threat to the home, then

      10      that would have received a higher priority.

      11             So we are trying to work both in tandem.

      12             What we're finding here is, you know, there

      13      is a bit of a contractor shortage that we are trying

      14      to deal with here.

      15             And that was one of the side benefits of

      16      having these not-for-profits, is some of them have

      17      wide coverage areas where they are able to bring

      18      more contractors into the picture.

      19             So we are working on the issue.

      20             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So at this point, given,

      21      now, all the applications are gonna -- going to be

      22      in at the same time --

      23             CHRIS LEO:  Uh-huh.

      24             SENATOR RITCHIE:  -- will you be hiring or

      25      putting on extra temporary staff to deal with the







                                                                   142
       1      applications, to get the money out as quickly as

       2      possible?

       3             CHRIS LEO:  We won't hire necessarily at HCR.

       4             And the not-for-profits know that if they

       5      need resources to fully meet the, you know,

       6      customer-service expectations, quite honestly, of

       7      the Legislature and Governor, that they are free to

       8      do so.

       9             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And are you keeping track

      10      of how quickly the actual check disbursements are

      11      going out?

      12             CHRIS LEO:  Yes, absolutely, we are.

      13             And, you know, it's worth noting that the

      14      legislation was signed on July 6th.

      15             We started -- the not-for-profits started

      16      issuing checks in the last week in -- in, basically,

      17      the first week of August.

      18             So, you know, we hope now, as -- again, as

      19      I mentioned earlier, that as the initial intake of

      20      applications and review of those applications

      21      subsides, that you will see an uptick in the

      22      delivery of funds.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Okay.

      24             Thank you.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  You said you had a big







                                                                   143
       1      uptick in the applications towards deadline.

       2             CHRIS LEO:  Uh-huh.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you see any need to open

       4      up that deadline a little bit longer, to allow those

       5      that might have not gotten to it?

       6             CHRIS LEO:  I think that the message was

       7      fairly well amplified and advertised before.

       8             You know, if there are homeowners who feel

       9      that, if they were denied for some reason, or if

      10      there is some special case that they would seek to

      11      make, there is an appeals process that homeowners

      12      can avail themselves of.

      13             But I don't see a need right now to open that

      14      up.

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  With second homes, I've

      16      heard diverging opinions on the multiple-owner

      17      situation --

      18             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

      19             SENATOR O'MARA:  -- and the income threshold,

      20      (indiscernible).

      21             Can you tell us how that is working?

      22             CHRIS LEO:  We -- we've heard the same

      23      confusion, where the -- just to settle on the policy

      24      now:  When there is more than one person on the deed

      25      of the home, an owner will be eligible for







                                                                   144
       1      assistance so long as no individual, or married

       2      couple if they file their taxes jointly, on the deed

       3      has an income of more than $275,000 in the

       4      taxable-year 2016.  The applicant need not be the

       5      individual with the highest income among those on

       6      the deed.

       7             So, essentially, you know, we will look, to

       8      check the income of the owner submitting the

       9      application.

      10             They would need to provide their tax returns

      11      so that we can make sure that they're within the

      12      income threshold set forth in the legislation.  And

      13      then there would just be a certification that no

      14      other owner of the property makes more than the

      15      threshold limit of $275,000.

      16                  [Inaudible comments from the audience.]

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  So -- yeah, can you speak

      18      closer to the microphone?

      19             CHRIS LEO:  Oh, I'm sorry.

      20             Sure.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  So now that the

      22      interpretation is, you're not just checking the

      23      income of the -- one of multiple owners, the one

      24      applying, you're not just checking theirs -- their

      25      income?







                                                                   145
       1             CHRIS LEO:  We would just check -- I'm sorry.

       2             We would just check the income of the person

       3      submitting the application.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.  But I thought you

       5      just said that you would then certify that no of the

       6      other owners made more than $257,000 --

       7             CHRIS LEO:  Then they would be asked to

       8      certify that no other owner makes more than

       9      $275,000.

      10             SENATOR O'MARA:  So if one of the owners

      11      makes more than $275,000, their property is not

      12      eligible?

      13             CHRIS LEO:  That's our interpretation of the

      14      legislation, yes.

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you think that that

      16      income threshold is necessary, to have it in there

      17      at all?

      18             CHRIS LEO:  I believe that there should be

      19      some threshold on second homes.

      20             I mean, it was lifted for primary homes,

      21      where we are certainly dealing with issues of people

      22      becoming homeless.

      23             And we understand that a lot of these

      24      secondary homes are legacy cottages.

      25             You yourself mentioned earlier, you know, how







                                                                   146
       1      special that residence was to you.

       2             But we do feel that there should be certain

       3      cost controls in place as we're giving out this

       4      assistance.

       5             SENATOR O'MARA:  Well, I happen to disagree

       6      with that.  And if somebody has damage to their

       7      property from something that, in this case, was at

       8      least partially government-aggravated, anyways,

       9      I don't agree with that threshold on that.

      10             But, I want to move on to the businesses.

      11             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  I've heard multiple

      13      complaints from businesses in the area here about

      14      the process being onerous, voluminous documentation

      15      being required to be provided, that many businesses

      16      are just opting to not pursue it, because of that.

      17             And I understand that the business

      18      applications for relief were, pretty much, below

      19      what was anticipated.

      20             Is that correct?

      21             CHRIS LEO:  It's my understanding.

      22             But, again, the deadline for that

      23      applications has not expired yet, so there is still

      24      time for applications to be submitted.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  What is the deadline for







                                                                   147
       1      that?

       2             CHRIS LEO:  I believe it's the -- the end of

       3      December, December 29th.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  Can you outline for us,

       5      generally, what is required of a business to

       6      provide?

       7             CHRIS LEO:  You know, I'm sorry, it's not my

       8      area of expertise, so I cannot.

       9             But I can -- you now, we have conferred --

      10      and we know that you have concerns, Senator.

      11             I know that we have brought them back to ESD,

      12      and my colleagues at ESD are working on streamlining

      13      that.

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  I've heard concerns that a

      15      1099 would be issued to the grant recipient.

      16             Can you discuss that?

      17             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

      18             We've certainly looked into that issue in

      19      regards to the 1099s.

      20             Again, I would defer to my colleagues at ESD.

      21             But it's my understanding that the small

      22      business recovery program will be sending 1099s to

      23      grant recipients, and that that's consistent with

      24      federal law.

      25             So that there has been -- we've understood







                                                                   148
       1      those concerns, but we think now it's a matter of

       2      federal law.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Is that just to businesses,

       4      or is that to property --

       5             CHRIS LEO:  It's just to businesses,

       6      actually.  So it does specifically state for

       7      businesses.  But that --

       8             SENATOR O'MARA:  So they'll get a 1099 for

       9      the grant and be taxed on that?

      10             CHRIS LEO:  It's my understanding that that's

      11      consistent with the federal law, sir.

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  I've also heard, in regard

      13      to the business process, that a business owner is

      14      not allowed to get reimbursement for having paid

      15      their employees to do some of the recovery work.

      16             CHRIS LEO:  Uh-huh.

      17             SENATOR O'MARA:  Is that being reviewed?

      18             CHRIS LEO:  Well, again, you know, it's not

      19      with the ESD program, but we have consulted with our

      20      colleagues there.  And I believe that -- well,

      21      actually, I'm not sure.

      22             I would have to get back to you.

      23             I don't know the answer to that, about the

      24      labor issue.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  It was my understanding







                                                                   149
       1      that -- and you're talking about ESD (Empire State

       2      Development).  Correct?

       3             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.  Uh-huh.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  And it was my understanding

       5      somebody was coming this evening, but, nobody is on

       6      this witness list today.

       7             So, do you know what happened there?

       8             CHRIS LEO:  No, I don't.

       9             I was never aware that ESD was invited to

      10      attend.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  I've also heard, with

      12      regards to the business program, that a business

      13      that paid cash for supplies, materials, or wages, is

      14      not eligible to be reimbursed, even if they have

      15      receipts?

      16             CHRIS LEO:  Right.

      17             Well, there, I do have news for you, sir.

      18             That the ESD has clarified that cash payments

      19      will, in fact, be eligible for assistance as long as

      20      those payments can be verified.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

      22             Thank you.

      23             CHRIS LEO:  Thank you, sir.

      24             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I have one follow-up

      25      question.







                                                                   150
       1             Just one with follow-up question.

       2             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

       3             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I know that we've had many

       4      conversations over the multiple dwelling.

       5             And I appreciate the Governor and his staff

       6      making sure that what was agreed to was how this is

       7      unfolding now.

       8             My only concern is that, there probably are

       9      some individuals who came to a workshop, who were

      10      told they were eligible, and then went to apply, and

      11      found out that, you know, 10 members had to turn in

      12      their tax returns, and they decided not to do it.

      13             So, for those individuals, how do we get the

      14      information out to them, since that changed?

      15             And, is the deadline now extended so that

      16      they can make sure their application is included?

      17             CHRIS LEO:  Sure.

      18             I'd like to assure you that any homeowner who

      19      was either given incorrect information or had an

      20      incorrect understanding of the regulations, and did

      21      not submit an application because of that, will be

      22      eligible to apply.

      23             We'd like to direct them to, kind of, our

      24      appeals process, and that can start as simply as

      25      sending an e-mail to LakeOntario@nyshcr.org, at







                                                                   151
       1      which point we will consider, kind of, their

       2      circumstances, and allow them access to the program,

       3      should they be eligible.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And do you have any way to

       5      actually disseminate this information, so that if

       6      they don't come to the flood hearing tonight, that

       7      they would have access to the change in the

       8      regulations?

       9             CHRIS LEO:  Absolutely.

      10             One of the benefits of working with the

      11      not-for-profits is they have lists of all the

      12      people.

      13             SENATOR RITCHIE:  They have lists.

      14             Okay.

      15             CHRIS LEO:  HCR, also my office, received

      16      1,000 calls the first three weeks, so we also have a

      17      robust contact list.

      18             And we would be more than happy to send

      19      emails to every person that we have on our list and

      20      the not-for-profit's lists.

      21             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And I would be interested

      22      in that appeals process, how that is actually going

      23      to work, and how many people apply for an appeal.

      24             CHRIS LEO:  Oh, absolutely, we will keep

      25      track.







                                                                   152
       1             We've received, I think, four or five appeals

       2      so far.

       3             We expect that to increase as the processing

       4      of the applications continues, and ends.

       5             So we will --

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Up to the microphone,

       7      please.

       8             CHRIS LEO:  Oh, sorry.  Yes.  I apologize.

       9             Yes, we will actually keep track, and let you

      10      know.

      11             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      12             CHRIS LEO:  Yes.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much for

      14      coming this evening.

      15             CHRIS LEO:  Thank you, sir.

      16             Next up is Frank Sciremammano.

      17             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  Senator O'Mara,

      18      sorry to jump in again here, but I want to correct

      19      the record real quick before Frank takes the stand.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Sure.

      21             LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI:  So you had asked me

      22      earlier if the corps was involved in the development

      23      of Plan 2014.

      24             So, my colleagues just corrected me.

      25             So the Buffalo District did provide some







                                                                   153
       1      technical assistance during the study phase that was

       2      occurring.  And then our headquarters, the Great

       3      Lakes and Ohio River Division, did have a little

       4      more direct involvement in the development of that

       5      plan.

       6             So I apologize for the confusion.

       7             I just wanted to set the record straight.

       8             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

       9             Thank you.

      10             Frank Sciremammano is a Ph.D., professional

      11      engineer --

      12             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  I'm sorry?

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  "PE," is that professional

      14      engineer?

      15             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Yes.

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yeah.

      17             -- with F-E-S Associates, a retired professor

      18      of engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology,

      19      and International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River

      20      Board.

      21             Thank you for being here this evening.

      22             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Good afternoon, or

      23      I guess this is good evening at this point.

      24             I apologize.

      25             I probably should have talked earlier when we







                                                                   154
       1      were talking about Plan 2014, rather than the grant

       2      process, because I won't be dealing with that,

       3      obviously.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  I agree.

       5             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  So, again, my name

       6      is Frank Sciremammano, Jr.  I'm a retired full

       7      professor of engineering at RIT, and a principal at

       8      F-E-S Associates in Rochester, New York.

       9             Of more relevance to this hearing, I'm

      10      currently, and have been since 1995, a member of the

      11      International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board,

      12      which was formerly called "The International

      13      St. Lawrence River Board of Control."

      14             I am now the senior member on that board,

      15      over 20 years, dealing with this issue directly.

      16             I also served, from 2000 to 2006, on the IJC

      17      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study Board, which

      18      examined and reported on alternative methods for

      19      regulating outflows from the lake.

      20             And Bill gave you -- Bill Werick gave you

      21      some history on that.

      22             I will fill in some of the holes that he left

      23      out.

      24             And for the record, I do not live on the

      25      lakeshore.  I live 10 miles in.







                                                                   155
       1             I do not have any financial interest in

       2      property or businesses on the shoreline.

       3             So you can think of it as a hobby, if will

       4      want.  More of an academic interest.

       5             Today I speak as an individual.

       6             I want to be very clear, I'm not speaking on

       7      behalf of the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board,

       8      I'm not speaking on behalf of the IJC, or any other

       9      organization.

      10             Mr. Stephen Durrett did speak on behalf of

      11      the board, and I generally concur with his formal

      12      statement, although, I do have some different

      13      answers to some of your questions than he had.

      14             Let me start by stating very clearly, that

      15      Plan 2014 did not cause the flooding experienced

      16      this year on Ontario.

      17             However, it's also just as clear that

      18      Plan 2014 did not protect against extreme water

      19      levels on the lake, as was stated by the IJC, while

      20      promoting Plan 2014.

      21             Further, I would argue that Plan 2014 is not

      22      capable of protecting against extreme levels on

      23      Lake Ontario, because the entire plan is purposely

      24      biased to protecting the downstream areas of the

      25      St. Lawrence River at the expense of the shoreline







                                                                   156
       1      communities of Lake Ontario, and especially those

       2      along the south shore of the lake in Western

       3      New York.

       4             Further, Plan 2014 does tie the hands of the

       5      board in dealing with taking preventive measures and

       6      dealing with lake levels, until it's too late to

       7      avoid them.

       8             I want to be very clear on that.

       9             As opposed to Plan '58D, the board is

      10      prohibited from taking -- making deviations that

      11      will benefit the lake, although we're allowed to

      12      take deviations that will benefit others.

      13             The only time we're allowed to do it is after

      14      we hit the trigger levels, and at that point,

      15      I would argue it's much too late.

      16             To illustrate how this bias was created in

      17      Plan 2014, I want to give you a short summary of how

      18      Plan 2014 came about.

      19             In 1999, the IJC appointed a study board, of

      20      which I was a member, and Dr. Dan Barletta who's in

      21      the audience, to examine the whole issue of outflow

      22      control on the St. Lawrence.

      23             The study acted in a transparent, open, and

      24      public way to develop guidelines, and to come up

      25      with recommendations to the IJC, which were







                                                                   157
       1      contained in a report delivered in March of 2006.

       2             The study recommended consideration of three

       3      plans:

       4             Plan A+, the economic plan, maximized

       5      economic benefits.

       6             Plan B+, the environmental plan, maximized

       7      the environmental benefits.

       8             Plan D+, the balanced plan, which as the name

       9      implies, balanced these things.

      10             Plan 2014, and I want to be very clear about

      11      this, Plan 2014 is not one of the recommended plans

      12      from the IJC study, and, in fact, it violates three

      13      of the principal guidelines of that study.

      14             Those guidelines stated that, if damages

      15      result from any plan, they should not fall

      16      disproportionately on any one geographic area or

      17      interest group.

      18             Well, almost all the damages from Plan 2014

      19      fall to the Lake Ontario shoreline, with a smaller

      20      damage to boating in the Thousand Islands area.

      21             But it's, basically, all to Lake Ontario and

      22      the Thousand Islands.

      23             All other geographic areas and interests are

      24      held harmless or benefit.

      25             The guidelines also state, that if damages







                                                                   158
       1      are anticipated, mitigation and compensation

       2      measures should be in place prior to implementation.

       3             Plan 2014 has none.

       4             Finally, the guidelines state, that any plan

       5      should be developed in an open process with wide

       6      public participation.

       7             Plan 2014 was developed in secret by a group

       8      that only consulted with environmental advocates.

       9             So how did this all happen?

      10             Well, after the study was completed, the IJC

      11      announced the proposed new order and plan that

      12      consisted of a revised Plan D+ from the study.

      13             That was the balanced plan.

      14             They renamed it Plan 2007, and then 2008, and

      15      they stated at that time, quote, Plan 2008 is an

      16      improvement with respect to the environmental and

      17      overall economic benefits, and takes a more balanced

      18      approach to all interests.

      19             They further stated that:  The environmental

      20      benefits of Plan B+, the environmental plan, are

      21      desirable, but implementation of Plan B+ is not

      22      possible, quote, without unduly reducing the

      23      benefits and protections currently accorded to other

      24      interests, so that the environmental plan would

      25      cause too much damage.







                                                                   159
       1             After holding public hearings, and facing

       2      demands from environmental groups and the

       3      New York State DEC --

       4             I see the assistant, or, whatever,

       5      commissioner, has left.

       6             -- but, they demanded that the environmental

       7      plan would be the only thing acceptable to them.

       8             So the IJC withdrew its proposal, and formed

       9      a new secret working group of representatives only.

      10             They worked in secret.  Nobody knew who was

      11      on the committee.  Nobody knew when they met.  No

      12      minutes.  No freedom of information.

      13             After a while they came out with a new

      14      version of Plan B+, which they recommended, which

      15      was termed "Bv7" for Plan B, Version 7.

      16             After some further secret negotiations, the

      17      working group came up with Plan 2014, which is just

      18      Plan Bv7, but with a slight modification to add

      19      trigger levels.

      20             When I examined Plan Bv7 and Plan 2014,

      21      I found that the environmental benefits were almost

      22      the same as the original Plan B+.

      23             And I'll direct your attention to the graphs

      24      I have --

      25             I would have put them up here.  I wasn't sure







                                                                   160
       1      you had a projector available.

       2             -- on the back of my -- the last page of my

       3      testimony.

       4             I have the environmental benefits of the

       5      plans:  B+ from the study, Bv7, and 2014 from the

       6      secret negotiations.

       7             They're almost identical, the environmental

       8      benefits.

       9             However, if you look at the damages to the

      10      coastal areas, both downstream on Lake Ontario --

      11      or, upstream on Lake Ontario, and downstream on the

      12      lower river, Plan B+, because of the guidelines from

      13      the study, distributed the damages between the two,

      14      and they were almost equal.

      15             However, Bv7 and Plan 2014, all the damages

      16      are to Lake Ontario, and the downstream areas have

      17      none.

      18             So why did that happen?

      19             I believe this was the result of the fact

      20      that the Providence of Quebec stood up for its -- by

      21      its commitments -- stood by its commitment that its

      22      citizens in downstream areas of the St. Lawrence

      23      should receive no less protection under any new plan

      24      than they did under the previous plan of operation,

      25      1958D.







                                                                   161
       1             As a result, all the damages were shifted to

       2      the lake.

       3             And, apparently, the New York State

       4      government representatives, and in particular, the

       5      New York State DEC, that were on the secret working

       6      group were fine with this shift.

       7             The shift is clearly illustrated in the

       8      graphs that I have attached.

       9             The environmental benefits again remain the

      10      same, yet the damages to Lake Ontario were increased

      11      dramatically, and those to the lower St. Lawrence

      12      River were eliminated.

      13             I'll give you just one example in which the

      14      way Plan 2014 achieved this shift.

      15             The F limit that Mr. Durrett talked about,

      16      that we worked under during April and May, seeks to

      17      balance flooding between downstream and upstream.

      18             True.

      19             However, the downstream level has a

      20      not-to-exceed maximum.  We can't go over that.

      21             Lake Ontario has no maximum.

      22             So this spring, while we held their levels

      23      steady, by either maintaining low flows or reducing

      24      flows dramatically, Lake Ontario jumped

      25      28 centimeters, almost a foot.







                                                                   162
       1             And this was done to hold the downstream

       2      level to its maximum; thus, downstream is protected

       3      while Lake Ontario is not.

       4             There are other ways, both subtle and not-so

       5      subtle, in Plan 2014, that show its imbalance, with

       6      a bias against protection for the shoreline

       7      communities of the lake.

       8             And I would be happy to explain these to you

       9      in an appropriate forum, with sufficient time,

      10      because it takes a while.

      11             Let me just summarize by stating that:

      12             Contrary to many of the IJC's statements,

      13      Plan 2014 will not protect from extreme levels on

      14      Lake Ontario.

      15             Further, in my opinion, the primary

      16      responsibility for this lies with the New York State

      17      government, in the form of the New York State DEC

      18      and the current administration which negotiated

      19      Plan 2014.  And if they didn't approve it, they at

      20      least acquiesced in it.

      21             They didn't stop it.

      22             Whenever I point out the inequities in the

      23      plan to my colleagues, I'm told, simply, that my

      24      New York State government negotiated and approved

      25      the plan, so what's the problem?







                                                                   163
       1             I thank you for your time today.

       2             I invite you to look further into this

       3      matter.

       4             If New York State does not act forcefully to

       5      modify the terms of Plan 2014, you should be

       6      prepared to budget continuing sums of State funding

       7      to address the direct damages and the economic

       8      degradation of our shoreline communities that will

       9      result from future operations under 2014.

      10             Again, I'm happy to answer any questions you

      11      might have.

      12             You may get slightly different answers than

      13      you got earlier.

      14                  [Applause.]

      15             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you want to start?

      16             Go ahead.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thank you for your

      18      testimony.  It's been very enlightening.

      19             And as I told you earlier, I was able to see

      20      you on that Facebook video that you did with the

      21      Democratic & Chronicle, so that helped -- it gave me

      22      a great perspective of your opinion too.

      23             Just for this year's flooding, could anything

      24      have been done to prevent the flooding, or make it

      25      less than what it turned out to be, by the control







                                                                   164
       1      board?

       2             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Not, in my opinion,

       3      to prevent it completely.

       4             We would have had flooding under the old

       5      plan, under this plan.

       6             We may have been able to make a difference of

       7      a few inches, especially on the rising part of it.

       8             And as you heard from the DEC commissioner,

       9      who was speaking about shipping, we may have been

      10      able to get it down a little quicker, but only at

      11      the expense of stopping the St. Lawrence Seaway from

      12      operating.

      13             So I think, within a few inches, we probably

      14      would have had the same flood.

      15             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

      16             You know, I find your testimony interesting.

      17             Potentially, it could get you in trouble, I

      18      guess, with various parties that may have a

      19      different opinion, and this goes back to my original

      20      question.

      21             I'm a little confused about the whole

      22      hierarchy of how this works.

      23             I understand the control board answers to the

      24      IJC.

      25             But how are -- how -- who's on the control --







                                                                   165
       1      how many people are on the control board?

       2             How are you appointed?

       3             Can you get fired from the control --

       4      I suppose you could get fired.

       5             How does this work?

       6             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  So here's how it

       7      works:

       8             The IJC, six members: three U.S., three

       9      Canadian.

      10             On the U.S. side is presidential appointees,

      11      so they turn over with the administration.

      12             One is full-time, the chair; and the others

      13      are part-time.

      14             They appoint the control board.

      15             They have 18 boards, because they deal with

      16      the boundary orders from coast to coast.

      17             We're one of the more controversial ones, so

      18      we have a large membership, 10 members.  We're

      19      appointed on the base -- by the IJC, and we serve at

      20      their pleasure, on the basis of our personal and

      21      professional capacities, not to represent any one

      22      group.

      23             We can be fired, and we can be terminated, at

      24      any time.

      25             And I fully expected to be terminated when







                                                                   166
       1      I came out in opposition of Plan 2014 strongly, but,

       2      they reappointed me.  And, so, I'm trying to work

       3      with it.

       4             The IJC sets the policies, adopts the plan,

       5      and we implement.  So we're the guys turning the

       6      crank, if you will.

       7             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

       8             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  And Plan 2014 does

       9      not allow us to deviate the way Plan '58D did,

      10      I think I mentioned that, until we hit the trigger

      11      levels.

      12             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

      13             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  And to me, that's a

      14      real problem.

      15             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I think from your

      16      testimony, the thing that I was most surprised, and

      17      maybe hadn't heard, is the fact that the

      18      environmental benefits of Plan 2014 aren't that more

      19      superior than the other potential plans out there.

      20             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Well, it was not

      21      different than the environmental plan that was

      22      recommended, which distributed the damages.

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.

      24             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  So the

      25      environmental benefit was the same, but the damages







                                                                   167
       1      were all shifted to the lake.

       2             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Okay.  All right.

       3             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  But the

       4      environmental benefit was greater than Plan D, which

       5      was the balanced plan, which had environmental

       6      benefits, but not to the same extent.

       7             So Plan D --

       8             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  So was the -- who

       9      they -- what I'm getting at, because I've heard, you

      10      know, the issue is, Plan 2014 was implemented at the

      11      behest of the environmentalists.

      12             So -- but they -- they probably want to

      13      (indiscernible) -- they like the environmentalists'

      14      plan anyways.

      15             So, I guess I'm not misled by the fact that

      16      they were pushing -- they didn't care about the lake

      17      interests, or maybe the shipping interests of the

      18      St. Lawrence.  They didn't have Quebec.

      19             They really just cared about the

      20      environmental issues, so they would have gone with

      21      Plan 2014 --

      22             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Well, they

      23      represented --

      24             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  -- over the

      25      environmentalists' plan?







                                                                   168
       1             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  -- but they

       2      represented the entire state in the secret

       3      negotiations.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

       5             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  They didn't

       6      represent just the DEC and just the environmental

       7      groups.

       8             They should have represented the homeowners,

       9      the businesses, along the lake and along the river

      10      as well.  And that was absent.

      11             My understanding, again, this was a secret

      12      process.

      13             I got some secondhand accounts of what went

      14      on.  And, basically, you know, this area was sold

      15      down the river, in my opinion.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Well, certainly, you

      17      can say, from the Governor's Office, there was

      18      certainly a lot of -- I don't know what happened

      19      behind the scenes, but there was, certainly, nothing

      20      done publicly.

      21             I never heard them come out against any of

      22      the plans, or, obviously, endorse any of the plans.

      23             But, you know, I've read and seen that they

      24      had to have some sort of tacit type of approval on

      25      it.







                                                                   169
       1             Did they go -- what other -- was it,

       2      I guess -- New York is the only one affected,

       3      I guess, by this plan.  Right?  There's is no other

       4      governmental --

       5             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  That's right.

       6             It's New York, province of Quebec, and

       7      province of Ontario, and then the two federal

       8      governments, that's who was negotiating.

       9             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

      10             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  That's who were

      11      negotiating.

      12             And, again, I repeat, Quebec stood up for

      13      their citizens.  They said, We will not accept any

      14      more damage.

      15             New York State, from what I heard, said,

      16      Fine.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Hmm.

      18             All right.

      19             Thank you very much.

      20             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Could you just explain to

      21      me, when you're talking about being able to deviate,

      22      that's the question we asked numerous times, and got

      23      a different answer?

      24             So could you explain that?

      25             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  So I'll try and be







                                                                   170
       1      clear.

       2             Under '58D, the board could deviate from --

       3      the plan is just a calculation.  It tells you how

       4      much water to let out every week.

       5             And so, under '58D, we were allowed to

       6      deviate from the plan, higher or lower, in response

       7      to our providing a benefit for one interest group if

       8      we didn't significantly harm another.

       9             That was the old way.

      10             Under Plan 2014, we are not allowed to

      11      deviate from the calculated value -- so the computer

      12      program runs the show -- unless we go above the

      13      trigger level or below the lower trigger level;

      14      except, we can deviate for a request from the River.

      15             If a ship is coming into Montreal, then we're

      16      allowed to deviate.

      17             This weekend we did a deviation to allow boat

      18      haul-outs on Lake St. Lawrence.

      19             Now, generally, those are fairly minor.

      20             But I think the whole idea that we can

      21      deviate for everybody else, except the lake, just

      22      grates on me a bit.

      23             And, again, we cannot deviate until we

      24      actually hit the trigger.

      25             We could have a perfect forecast, a month in







                                                                   171
       1      advance, that we're going to exceed the trigger.

       2             We're not allowed to do anything, until we

       3      hit it.

       4             And that's in the order, and it says that

       5      can't be changed unless they go back to the

       6      governments and get approval.

       7             So, that's a hard-and-fast.

       8             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So do you believe, if that

       9      authority still existed, that it would have helped

      10      the situation this year?

      11             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Again, I think this

      12      it might have helped.

      13             It's hard to judge what actions the board

      14      would have taken and when.

      15             But the most difference it would have made

      16      was a few inches, I believe, because things did

      17      happen very quickly in the month of April.

      18             SENATOR RITCHIE:  So do you believe, in the

      19      future, without that ability to deviate, that you

      20      could end up with flooding in a year that, maybe,

      21      flooding is not something that would happen?

      22             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  I do.

      23             I believe it's true, and especially with the

      24      bias in the plan with the F limit.

      25             I believe that, even without the flooding







                                                                   172
       1      downstream on the Ottawa, we could have a problem in

       2      future, and the board could see it coming, and

       3      wouldn't be able to do anything.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And so I assume you do

       5      believe that Montreal's interests were taken over

       6      this area's interest?

       7             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  I think they

       8      were -- they were taken over that in the development

       9      of Plan 2014, and it has to do with the

      10      representation and the secret negotiations that went

      11      on, in my opinion.

      12             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      13             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  And that nobody was

      14      there standing up for New York State beyond the

      15      wetlands, if you will.

      16             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  In some of the discussions

      18      today, or comments back to us, I was given some hope

      19      that, you know, there's analysis.

      20             We had the event.  We've been through that.

      21      Analysis is going to take place.  We're gonna get a

      22      report.  And, that we might have some changes in the

      23      way things -- you know, what we learned from that,

      24      we can move forward with that information, make some

      25      changes, and go forward.







                                                                   173
       1             But, in some of your remarks you were just

       2      making, of the -- how you're constrained on the

       3      control board, you're saying it's written into the

       4      plan.  It's not something that simply,

       5      administratively, we can do this better if we do

       6      something -- you're not going of be able to make

       7      that change without Plan 2014 itself being amended?

       8             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  That's my

       9      understanding, the way it's written.

      10             Not only that, the IJC can't make a change in

      11      our deviation authority until they go back to

      12      governments and ask.

      13             But I am hopeful.

      14             You know, I do not believe 2014 will be

      15      thrown out, and it does have some good features.  It

      16      does bring it up to date, it's more modern than

      17      '58D.

      18             But, I've already suggested some changes.

      19             One:  The F limit needs to be extended so

      20      that the lake and the river are balanced better in a

      21      high-water event.

      22             Number two:  I think the board should have

      23      discretion to deviate if we have a good forecast.

      24             And we do probabilistic forecasts that go out

      25      six months.







                                                                   174
       1             But, you know, in a month forecast, on six

       2      weeks, if we have a good forecast, where we're going

       3      to see the trigger level, then maybe we should be

       4      able to deviate at that point, instead of waiting

       5      till we actually get above it.

       6             And, in addition, I think the trigger levels

       7      are set too high, and I had pointed that out in the

       8      hearings.

       9                  [Applause.]

      10             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  On the upper end,

      11      they're set at the 2 percent level.  At the bottom,

      12      95 percent.

      13             You see a bias right there against high

      14      water.

      15             And, when we pointed that out at the

      16      hearings, the answer I got is:  Well, we tried

      17      5 percent, we tried 1 percent, we tried...

      18             But, the group, the secret working group,

      19      didn't feel the environmental benefits were adequate

      20      then.

      21             So my question was:  Who was at the table

      22      saying that the damages were too much with the

      23      2 percent?

      24             Nobody.

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Thank you.







                                                                   175
       1                  [Technical difficulties.]

       2                  [No audio or video.]

       3             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  [No audio or

       4      video]...  A year earlier, the level was exactly the

       5      same at the end of the winter.

       6             The board took no action at that point.

       7             We looked at the snowpack.

       8             We looked at what had been happening, in

       9      terms of the precipitation figures, and whatever

      10      outlooks we could find.

      11             We decided in 2016 not to take any action.

      12             In 2017, there was really no discussion

      13      because we didn't have that authority.

      14             So it's hard to say what the board would have

      15      done at that point.

      16             But, no, that was not an unusual -- it was

      17      not unusual to be about 11 inches above average,

      18      given the warm, wet winter.  We had very little

      19      snowpack.

      20             So, the anticipation was, that all that

      21      runoff that we would normally get in April, say, was

      22      already in the lake.

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  What -- can you talk a

      24      little bit about Lake Erie levels, and that's been

      25      high for several years, and that's impact on what







                                                                   176
       1      we're dealing with here on Lake Ontario?

       2             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Yeah, I can't give

       3      you the exact figures.

       4             It was high, but it wasn't unusually high.

       5      And the supply from Lake Erie, while above average,

       6      was nothing that we were super-concerned about,

       7      because it wasn't that much above average.

       8             And, again, that's just the kind of action,

       9      that we're prohibited from taking any action at that

      10      point.  Even if we saw Lake Erie very, very high,

      11      we're not allowed to do anything until we hit the

      12      trigger level.

      13             SENATOR O'MARA:  Yes.

      14             Again, back to these negotiations, just to

      15      clarify for me:

      16             So they started around 2008.

      17             What was the end time frame of that --

      18             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  You know, I don't

      19      know for sure.  It was all secret.

      20             We had no way of even finding out they were

      21      meeting, and who was on the group.

      22             So I would ask the IJC these questions.  Or,

      23      the State of New York, because they participated

      24      fully on it.  They had representatives on this

      25      negotiating team.







                                                                   177
       1             I can't give you precise dates.

       2             It's roughly that time frame, roughly, 2008,

       3      2009, ending up around 2012, '13.

       4             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

       5             We definitely should have had you testify

       6      earlier.

       7             However, we hope you will be at our next

       8      forum.

       9             FRANK SCIREMAMMANO, JR.:  Anytime.

      10             I appreciate the opportunity, and I thank you

      11      for taking up this issue, and I hope you will follow

      12      up on it.

      13                  [Applause.]

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next we have Mary Austerman

      15      from the New York Sea Grant, Wayne County

      16      Cooperative Extension.

      17             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Good evening.

      18             My name is Mary Austerman, and I'm the

      19      coastal community development specialist for

      20      New York Sea Grant.

      21             I would like the thank the Senate Standing

      22      Committee on Environmental Conservation,

      23      particularly Senators O'Mara and Ritchie, for

      24      the invitation to testify on the impacts of the

      25      2017 Lake Ontario record high water level event.







                                                                   178
       1             New York Sea Grant is one of 33 state

       2      sea-grant programs in the United States, and is a

       3      cooperative program of the State University of

       4      New York, Cornell University, and NOAA.

       5             As an extension professional with New York

       6      Sea Grant, it is my job to provide science to my

       7      stakeholders that will allow them to make better

       8      informed decisions.

       9             My comments today are intended to provide

      10      preliminary results from the 2017 Lake Ontario

      11      High Water Level Impact Survey coordinated by

      12      Cornell University and New York Sea Grant.

      13             This survey was developed in response to

      14      stakeholders' requests for standardized impact

      15      reporting.

      16             New York Sea Grant awarded funding to

      17      Drs. Scott Steinschneider and Richard Stedman at

      18      Cornell University to develop and implement a high

      19      water level impact survey.

      20             The survey was live from May 26th until

      21      August 31st of this year.

      22             Various outreach methods were used to

      23      advertise the survey.  These included newspaper,

      24      social media, TV, radio, flyers, municipal e-lists,

      25      and agenda time at related meetings.







                                                                   179
       1             The goals of the survey were documenting the

       2      parcel-level impacts of the event on waterfront

       3      properties, providing municipalities with

       4      information that can assist them in community-based

       5      planning to reduce flood risks, and verifying

       6      existing flood-risk modeling.

       7             The survey targeted all waterfront

       8      properties.

       9             We collected qualitative data about parcel

      10      location, severity of inundation, severity of the

      11      erosion, damage to shoreline protection, flood

      12      insurance, business impacts, and severity of overall

      13      impacts.

      14             In addition, pictures of the waterline, and

      15      of property damage, were provide by respondents.

      16             This survey did not collect economic data

      17      because many impacts would not be known until the

      18      water levels recede, and inundation reports during

      19      peak or near peak water levels are necessary to

      20      verify existing flood-risk modeling.

      21             In a moment I'm going review some of the

      22      preliminary results from the survey.

      23             And as I go through those, I'd just like to

      24      you please keep in mind that we did conduct a

      25      separate St. Lawrence River survey.  Those data have







                                                                   180
       1      not been analyzed at this point.

       2             Although this survey was available for all

       3      waterfront properties, it is possible that those who

       4      experienced impacts were more likely to respond than

       5      those who did not.

       6             These results have not been published.

       7             This report out is on preliminary analyses.

       8             This report out is in percentages, and

       9      removed all instances of "does not apply" or

      10      "I don't know" before calculating those percentages.

      11             I also would like to note that these results

      12      were provided by my survey partner,

      13      Dr. Scott Steinschneider.

      14             So what I'll do is, you all have these

      15      graphics in the testimony that was provided.  But

      16      I do want to also put some slides up so everyone in

      17      the audience can see what we're talking about.

      18                  [Slide show begins.]

      19             MARY AUSTERMAN:  This first graphic is a

      20      distribution map showing our response.

      21             I will say that the map does show all

      22      507 "true" responses.

      23             We did receive almost 900 responses in the

      24      Qualtrics online database, but many of those were

      25      screened out.







                                                                   181
       1             Some of those reasons were:  Because they

       2      were not on the lake itself.  Some of those were

       3      St. Lawrence and Canada.  They were incomplete, or

       4      duplicates.

       5             Some of these preliminary results that I can

       6      share with you, again, these are in percentages, and

       7      first we'll look at the inundation of different

       8      areas on the property.

       9             And so if you'll look here, you'll see that

      10      this is this near-shore area.  Almost 100 percent of

      11      survey respondents indicated that they were

      12      experiencing inundation in those near-shore areas.

      13             I would like to note that fewer respondents

      14      reported experiencing inundation on their first

      15      floor; however, many, nearly 50 percent, were still

      16      experiencing inundation impacts to their foundation.

      17             The next graph shows erosion damage to

      18      different aspects of the property again.

      19             And I know this is a little confusing to look

      20      at.

      21             So some of the take-homes on this:

      22             If you look over here to the left, this is

      23      "no impact."

      24             So here you can see that 71 percent of people

      25      were responding that they did not have







                                                                   182
       1      erosional-damage impact to their main structure.

       2             Over here, in the most severe impacted areas,

       3      as you can imagine, most of the erosion damage that

       4      was experienced is in the shore areas.

       5             But I would also mention that, here, we still

       6      do have impacts as well in the small- and

       7      moderate-impact categories.

       8             The next thing I'd like to show you is land

       9      loss from erosion.  Again, this is percentages.

      10             And the take-home here is that over

      11      80 percent of people were reporting at least some

      12      degree of land loss from erosion.

      13             The next slide is showing the damage to

      14      shoreline protective features, and this is

      15      specifically talking about either sloping or

      16      vertical walls.

      17             And, again, you can see that, of the

      18      respondents that responded that they did have these

      19      types of structures, nearly 90 percent were

      20      reporting some type of impact to those structures.

      21             And one of the questions I always ask in

      22      these types of survey are:  Taking the full event

      23      into account, what is your perception of the overall

      24      impact?

      25             And as you can see, right here:







                                                                   183
       1             From 7 to 10 being the most extreme.

       2             So, 1 is no impact, 10 is substantial.

       3             Over 50 percent of respondents indicated that

       4      the severity level was 7 or greater.

       5             I also mentioned that we collected pictures

       6      from survey respondents, and I will share some of

       7      those with you.

       8             And, again, we were looking at the impacts

       9      of -- well, we were looking at the location of the

      10      waterline on the property, the overall impact of

      11      water on the property.

      12             And these images are being used for

      13      validation of an existing flood-risk model, and that

      14      work will begin in 2018 with Sea Grant funding to,

      15      again, Drs. Steinschneider and Stedman.

      16             We'll also be archiving these photos and

      17      making them available.  And this is only 6 of over

      18      500 responses.

      19             The lighting in here is not great, so I'll

      20      try to explain what's happening here.

      21             So this red area here is where the

      22      property -- the property line.  This is the lake.

      23             And these pictures are showing where each of

      24      these features on the property are located.

      25             This is in Orleans County, the end of May.







                                                                   184
       1      And you can see that they are experiencing

       2      inundation impacts to a lot of those near-shore

       3      areas that was described earlier in the

       4      presentation.

       5             Again, in Orleans County, this here is also

       6      water.  That this is lakefront.

       7             You can see on the left, they're experiencing

       8      wave action on a wall.

       9             And, here, this is pretty inland, and you can

      10      see inundation that far back, from here to here.

      11             In Monroe County, again, here is where the

      12      property is located.

      13             On this particular day in May, there was

      14      inundation back as far as this location, and here as

      15      well.

      16             Moving east to Wayne County, again, property

      17      location.  Water from the bay or lake.

      18             This is from the lake.

      19             And you can see again, these are the

      20      locations of these images, and we have inundation

      21      impacts, at least foundational impacts as well.

      22             Again, in Wayne County, Sodus Point, we have

      23      foundation inundation.  Potentially, structural

      24      inundation.  And, again, location of images on those

      25      property -- on that piece of property.







                                                                   185
       1             Oswego County, beginning of May, the images

       2      were taken here on the shoreline, and here inland.

       3      And you can see here, this is inundated.

       4             This is a structure, and the water is at

       5      least at the foundation, if not in the structure,

       6      and threatening this wall.

       7             So just to -- I'd like to just mention a few

       8      of the uses of this data.

       9             Some immediate uses include:

      10             Documenting this record high water level

      11      event, providing standardized results that will

      12      allow for lake-wide reporting;

      13             Identifying areas that are most vulnerable to

      14      high water levels for future community-based

      15      planning;

      16             Validating an existing flood-risk model that

      17      could inform community-level flood-resiliency

      18      planning, which, again, initial steps are underway

      19      with that, with the 2018 Sea Grant-funded project;

      20             And assisting in the leveraging of

      21      competitive funds for making communities,

      22      businesses, and private landowners more adaptable to

      23      high water levels.

      24             As an extension associate representing

      25      New York Sea Grant and Cornell University, it is my







                                                                   186
       1      job to provide science-based information so

       2      stakeholders can make better informed decisions; in

       3      this case, about reducing risks to future coastal

       4      flood events.

       5             I'm grateful for this opportunity to share

       6      these results with you today, and am hopeful that

       7      they will empower communities to begin improving

       8      their coastal-flood resiliency.

       9             Thank you.

      10             SENATOR O'MARA:  Go ahead, Bob.

      11             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  You mentioned that this

      12      does not include economic impact to this point.

      13             Is that within the plans, or not?

      14             Not really?

      15             MARY AUSTERMAN:  It's not within our current

      16      scope.

      17             One, this was -- this happened quick, and so

      18      we had to get money out, to get the survey out

      19      quickly.

      20             We had to go through institutional review

      21      board approval to conduct the survey, which also

      22      takes time.

      23             And to include an economic component to that,

      24      we'd have to also come up with a way to validate

      25      those figures.







                                                                   187
       1             And in the interests of time, and also the

       2      expertise that we had on our limited team, we just

       3      couldn't do it at that point.

       4             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  I was asking that as

       5      much -- I know we -- the Governor put in for FEMA

       6      disaster declaration, and that is economic-based.

       7      You have to meet thresholds, and -- and -- you know.

       8             So I was wondering if those might be

       9      connected at all.

      10             The other thing you showed, 506 properties.

      11             Do you have any sense how many properties

      12      there are along there, or what percentage you are,

      13      you know, dealing with, in showing this survey?

      14             MARY AUSTERMAN:  That is a good question.

      15             That's one of the ones that

      16      Dr. Scott Steinschneider and I have been talking

      17      about.  And he's working on analysis at this point,

      18      to see what percentage of folks were actually

      19      reached and responded.

      20             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  The number of people that

      21      had in -- in your analysis, do you feel like -- you

      22      said you did reject some --

      23             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Uh-huh.

      24             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  -- because they weren't

      25      appropriate, or something.







                                                                   188
       1             So were these on -- if you were on a bay,

       2      would have you -- off Lake Ontario, would you have

       3      been included, or no?

       4             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Yes, waterfront.

       5             So, bay communities were included.

       6             Some of the examples of screen-out responses

       7      were either:

       8             Not complete;

       9             Some were clicked-through;

      10             Some people stopped at the initial upload of

      11      photos, so none of the other information was

      12      collected;

      13             We did have a couple of Canadian responses,

      14      and we had some St. Lawrence responses as well.

      15             But we did collect bay responses.

      16             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Your sense -- would it be

      17      your sense that it's enough of a representative

      18      group that, perhaps, those doing the study might be

      19      able to project that out, showing, you know,

      20      complete impact, or, you know, of the whole south

      21      and east shore?

      22             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Well, again, when we started

      23      this, we weren't sure what the response rate would

      24      be.

      25             One reason, knowing that it was an extremely







                                                                   189
       1      challenging time for those waterfront property

       2      owners, so we didn't know if people would even take

       3      the time to respond to the survey.

       4             We're happy with the results that we got, the

       5      response number that we got.

       6             I can't really -- I can't really provide an

       7      answer, if someone could make the jump from what

       8      we've collected to putting economic dollars to that.

       9             But the data is available.

      10             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  And did you do any

      11      connection, or will there be any, with -- we've been

      12      told there were 3400 people that made application to

      13      the State.

      14             Do you know what -- you know, will there be

      15      any connection between the properties that you

      16      researched and those 3400 who might have made

      17      application?

      18             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Well, our survey rolled out

      19      before that funding opportunity was available.

      20             It would have been good to put in a question

      21      in there, to ask if people were applying for those

      22      funds.

      23             But our survey was rolled out first, so

      24      I don't know if there's a way to make that

      25      connection.

       1             ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS:  Thank you.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  All set.

       3             Thank you very much for your work.

       4             MARY AUSTERMAN:  Thank you.

       5                  [Applause.]

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next up is Dale Currier,

       7      director of Oswego County Emergency Management.

       8             DALE CURRIER:  Can you hear me?

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Maybe a little closer.

      10             DALE CURRIER:  A little closer.

      11             How's that?

      12             SENATOR O'MARA:  That's better.

      13             DALE CURRIER:  Can you guys hear me?

      14             All right.  Just don't throw anything sharp

      15      or pointed.

      16             All right.

      17             Good evening.

      18             My name is Dale Currier, and I'm the director

      19      of emergency management for Oswego County.

      20             First, I'd like to thank Senator O'Mara and

      21      Senator Ritchie for the invitation to present

      22      tonight, as well as thank Assemblymen Oaks and

      23      Barclay for your time and interest in this panel,

      24      and this event.

      25             This is a topic of utmost importance to







                                                                   191
       1      thousands of Oswego County residents whose daily way

       2      of life, livelihoods, standard of living, and

       3      properties, both personal and business and

       4      municipal, have been severely impacted.

       5             This community-wide impact from high water

       6      levels has continued for the past six-plus months,

       7      and despite the best efforts to reduce the lake

       8      level to normal levels, will likely continue for

       9      some time to come.

      10             There are many who are still experiencing

      11      damage, increasing damage, particularly when the

      12      high winds on Lake Ontario blow from the north and

      13      the northwest.

      14             I am not here today to discuss the merits or

      15      deficiencies of the Plan 2014.  This is an issue to

      16      be dealt with by policymakers.

      17             Instead, I do speak as an

      18      emergency-management professional with

      19      responsibility for over 120,000 residents of

      20      Oswego County, of which 25 percent of our area is

      21      water, most of which is Lake Ontario and its

      22      tributaries.

      23             As such, much of our county has been built

      24      and developed around water-based businesses and

      25      industries that rely on having a consistent source







                                                                   192
       1      and a consistent level of water.

       2             I believe it's important to note that the

       3      impacts and damage, whether directly through erosion

       4      and structural damage, or indirectly through the

       5      degradation and outright destruction of businesses

       6      that rely on people coming from around the world for

       7      recreation, vacations, and summer residents.

       8             Since mid-May, I and many other first

       9      responders have experienced this flood, at times,

      10      7 days a week, 16 hours a day, which pales compared

      11      to some of the people who have been directly

      12      impacted in their homes.

      13             But I could spend hours sharing the

      14      experiences we've had standing in knee-deep water in

      15      someone's front yard, as they wonder, will local

      16      emergency services be able to get to their home, as

      17      they're giving care to an elderly resident with a

      18      terminal illness?

      19             And they don't want to leave their home, the

      20      home they've worked their entire life for, and they

      21      have no local family.

      22             I recently, during the last storm, stood on

      23      the shore and watched 10-foot waves throw

      24      football-sized rocks 20 to 30 feet past the

      25      breakwall into the side of a home.







                                                                   193
       1             And I've sat and listened patiently while

       2      people shared their most personal, financial, and

       3      family situations regarding their business, that

       4      cannot function, or could not function, because of

       5      the high water.  They felt totally helpless, and at

       6      the mercy of what they believed initially to be

       7      solely the result of Plan 2014.

       8             Regardless of the underlying initiating cause

       9      or causes of the incredibly high water, the outcome

      10      has been the same:  Severe economic damage which

      11      will impact many people's lives for decades to come,

      12      which, for some, is the rest of their natural life.

      13             And always they ask the question, "Will it

      14      come again?"

      15             You know, in the interest of time, and

      16      previous presenters, I'm cutting out some of my

      17      presentation.  So, if a few of my notes get a little

      18      cryptic here, please bear with me.

      19             From what we've heard, it's readily apparent

      20      that we can't expect to effectively and safely drain

      21      this water system when it's overloaded.

      22             It's analogous to draining a full bathtub

      23      through that a straw when the faucet is still on.

      24             Furthermore, artificially introducing more

      25      water into the system will only serve to cause more







                                                                   194
       1      damage elsewhere in the system.

       2             I believe, by definition, what we've

       3      experienced is the truest form of a dilemma related

       4      to a natural disaster.

       5             There's no one answer or solution to the

       6      myriad problems, and everyone involved is going to

       7      lose something, hence I believe only time will tell

       8      if Plan 2014 was, in fact, a significant

       9      contributing factor for this event.

      10             To me, however, the most important part of

      11      these hearings, at least from the perspective of the

      12      persons impacted, is to identify, how do they get

      13      help?

      14             We have heard some information tonight.

      15             But in terms of grants and low-interest loans

      16      to repair or replace what has been lost, time is of

      17      the essence.

      18             Oswego County's industrial tax base, compared

      19      to the amount of property that is agricultural or

      20      tax-free, is not like some other areas that have

      21      been impacted by this same flooding.

      22             Living on or near the water is not generally

      23      a sign of wealth in Oswego County.

      24             Instead, it's often the result of a

      25      residence, business, or piece of waterfront property







                                                                   195
       1      being passed through many generations of a family.

       2             Numerous people have shared with me that they

       3      retain the property as best they can, paying the

       4      cost of the taxes on waterfront property, out of a

       5      sense of family obligation to continue on with it.

       6             Many have said this may well be the

       7      proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, as

       8      they cannot afford to pay ten, twenty, and, in some

       9      cases, fifty to sixty thousand dollars, to restore

      10      their frontage to a level that would protect them

      11      from this type of event in the future.

      12             So let's look at the early response.

      13             New York State did very well.

      14             We heard from DEC.

      15             We know Homeland Security, Office of

      16      Emergency Management, worked well with sandbagging.

      17             The national guard and the DOT stepped up to

      18      the plate, to almost 60,000 sandbags here in Oswego

      19      County.

      20             Local first responders, coast guardsmen,

      21      stepped up to help people who couldn't place

      22      sandbags, to take care of that.

      23             But we still have a lot of damage.

      24             I believe in Oswego County the figure now is

      25      in the tens of millions of dollars, with significant







                                                                   196
       1      damage to the Port of Oswego, not to mention the

       2      business losses incurred throughout the county west

       3      of Route 81, and the damage to residential

       4      properties.

       5             Looking ahead to recovery and mitigation,

       6      I believe the picture is more dire.

       7             This is a seven-month flood.

       8             Yes, New York State did appropriate

       9      $45 million for relief; however, accessing this

      10      funding has been a struggle for many people needing

      11      to make repairs before winter sets in.

      12             And many people -- in many cases, people have

      13      had to borrow money to hire engineers and pay for

      14      stopgap property remediation to prevent further

      15      damage caused by the winter storms that will soon be

      16      upon us.

      17             In many cases, people tell me they cannot

      18      start remediation until the water recedes and they

      19      can see the true extent of their damage.

      20             New York State, as noted, has requested a

      21      Presidential disaster declaration back in August.

      22             Shortly thereafter, we know the southern --

      23      or, the southern U.S., most notably, Florida and

      24      Texas, took a major pounding with hurricanes, and

      25      other hurricanes have taken other resources and time







                                                                   197
       1      from FEMA.

       2             Despite reassurances from federal officials,

       3      however, that financial support for our area is

       4      being worked on, no tangible relief has been

       5      received yet from them.

       6             I believe personally, and professionally, the

       7      Lake Ontario flood will go down in the history of

       8      modern emergency management as, and I quote, the

       9      huge seven-month flood that only the locals knew

      10      about, end quote.

      11             Therefore, I respectfully ask this panel and

      12      all who are witness to these proceedings to move

      13      forward on getting financial funding now -- this

      14      week, if possible -- so more people can begin

      15      rebuilding.

      16             With immediate funding, it's likely much

      17      rebuilding will be completed a year from now, yet

      18      some large projects will take longer.

      19             I'd like to end with an old adage from my

      20      days as a corporate trainer.

      21             When often asked, quote, "What if we spend

      22      money to train people, and then they leave us?" my

      23      general response was, "What if we don't train them,

      24      and they stay?  What will that cost us?"

      25             Along the same vein I ask, "How much are the







                                                                   198
       1      people of Oswego County, and all eight impacted

       2      counties along Lake Ontario, going to continue to

       3      lose if they cannot afford to fix the current damage

       4      before more happens?"

       5             The answer, I believe, is that providing the

       6      needed money now will go a long way to reducing the

       7      future costs of reduced property taxes collected,

       8      lost business, and the trickle-down effect that will

       9      follow, such as lost sales tax, et cetera.

      10             With continued inaction, the true costs will

      11      only be staggering, but will last for a decade or

      12      more.

      13             Thank you for your invitation.

      14             I trust this has been helpful.

      15             Is there anything I can add?

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  I'm sure.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  I just want to say

      18      thank you, Dale, for testifying today.

      19             And, also, thanks for your office's courtesy

      20      shown to my office through, really, the tough -- the

      21      really tough parts of the flooding.  And I know you

      22      and I toured around, looking at some of the damage

      23      that was done.

      24             Maybe just a quick question, then.

      25             If you could change, and now have gone







                                                                   199
       1      through this whole process, is there something that

       2      you would say that we can improve upon, at a state

       3      level or a local level, to provide relief to people,

       4      especially in regards to emergency management?

       5             DALE CURRIER:  Well, right now, timing is

       6      fortunate, in that we're at the five-year cycle of

       7      redoing the county's hazard mitigation plan.

       8             And, certainly, we have a very different

       9      picture of lake flooding, coastal erosion,

      10      et cetera, than we had when we did it seven years

      11      ago.

      12             So the good news is, we'll be working with

      13      all of the towns and municipalities to update that

      14      plan.

      15             That said, to increase their resilience that

      16      we've heard a lot about, to mitigate future damage,

      17      it's great to come up with a plan.  But as we know,

      18      municipalities and individuals are strapped for

      19      cash, and the plan is not going to accomplish much

      20      unless funding is available, up front, to mitigate

      21      this for the future.

      22             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thanks.

      23             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Just more of a comment,

      24      Dale.

      25             I certainly understand your comment about







                                                                   200
       1      getting the funding out the door, and frustration

       2      some of the people are dealing with.

       3             And that is something that, pretty much, on a

       4      daily basis, I've been calling to make sure that the

       5      money is flowing.

       6             With Friday's announcement that they don't

       7      have to prioritize what applications are funding, my

       8      hope is that many of those applications that are

       9      further down the pile will begin to see some kind of

      10      disbursements, going forward.

      11             So, I would just ask, if you or anybody here

      12      has an application in, it doesn't look like it's

      13      moving, just please let our office know.

      14             DALE CURRIER:  Okay.

      15             And to Will's question, looking forward, if

      16      this were to happen again, it's taken seven

      17      months -- and I realize bureaucracy can take time --

      18      but it's taken seven months to get to this point.

      19             And I can safely say that, probably, four

      20      weeks in, a lot of people had a lot of ideas as to

      21      how much this was, potentially, going to cost.

      22             So if I were going to suggest something

      23      different if this happened in the future, is get

      24      those pots of money, get that process going, much,

      25      much sooner, because you know it's going to be







                                                                   201
       1      needed.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  This may be outside your

       3      area in the county, but, do you have any sense of

       4      what the impact to sales-tax collections in the

       5      county has been impacted as a result of that?

       6             DALE CURRIER:  Yeah, I have no idea, and I've

       7      not heard any numbers on that.

       8             If you'd like, I'll see if I can find out.

       9             I don't know if it may be a little too early,

      10      at the summer season, to know.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      12             DALE CURRIER:  Thank you.

      13                  [Applause.]

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next up, Gary DeYoung,

      15      director of tourism, Thousand Islands International

      16      Tourism Council.

      17             GARY DeYOUNG:  Thank you.

      18             The Thousand Islands International Tourism

      19      Council is the destination marketing organization.

      20             We play an official role in Jefferson County.

      21             We also actively collaborate with the tourism

      22      agencies in Oswego and St. Lawrence county.

      23             And by the word "International" in our title,

      24      we represent and market the Ontario side of the

      25      St. Lawrence as well in the Thousand Islands region.







                                                                   202
       1             Today's topic is particularly important for

       2      tourism.

       3             Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River are

       4      at the very core of the tourist industry in the

       5      Thousand Islands.

       6             Much of the region's tourism is based on

       7      water activity, such as boating, paddling, fishing,

       8      and scuba diving.

       9             Waterfront attractions, including scenic boat

      10      tours, lighthouses, museums, and island castles are

      11      important parts of drawing visitors to the Thousand

      12      Islands, and the waterfront accommodations from

      13      campsites to four-star hotels differentiate our

      14      destination from others.

      15             This year's wet, dreary spring and early

      16      summer really resulted in a bad impact on this

      17      region's tourism business.

      18             In early September, the Thousand Islands

      19      International Tourism Council conducted a survey

      20      regarding the high-water impacts on business.

      21             With 109 stakeholders responding, 47 percent

      22      indicated a very negative impact, 35 percent

      23      indicated a somewhat negative impact.

      24             So on the negative side, 80 percent of our

      25      responses came in.







                                                                   203
       1             The average decline in business from normal,

       2      of 29 percent, on average, with many being well over

       3      50 percent.

       4             The wet weather and high water forced some

       5      attractions to open late or to curtail operations as

       6      they scrambled to make adaptations.

       7             It created huge problems for marine

       8      businesses.

       9             It impacted the region's tourism in many

      10      ways, and at the bottom line, it simply kept

      11      visitors away during the crucial summer season.

      12             I want to touch on a few points that are

      13      sometimes lost in the conversation about tourism and

      14      water levels.

      15             First, it's important to understand that the

      16      impacts of the weather and water go well beyond

      17      those that fell directly on the shore.

      18             With waterfront activity curtailed, lodging

      19      operators, attractions, restaurants, and retailers

      20      in tourism-sensitive communities all lost business.

      21             With those -- with waterfront had to deal

      22      with damages, but businesses a few blocks away, or

      23      even a few miles away, also suffered substantial

      24      losses.

      25             Secondly, for tourism, perception is often







                                                                   204
       1      reality.

       2             If a customer believes an area is flooded and

       3      cancels a trip, the businesses lose money even if

       4      they were, in reality, not flooded and fully

       5      operational.

       6             While waterfront businesses in the region

       7      took hard hits from the water inundation, many were

       8      able to make adaptations and continue operations,

       9      and others near the waterfront had little or no

      10      physical impact on their operations; however,

      11      anecdotal stories of customer misperceptions about

      12      the conditions abound.

      13             The tourism council saw this trend early in

      14      the summer season, and allocated some of its

      15      rainy-day funds -- pun intended -- to bolster a

      16      social-media program to defeat some of the things

      17      that were out there.

      18             And the council has also partnered with the

      19      tourism agencies in Oswego and St. Lawrence counties

      20      to submit a Market New York grant application, which

      21      we hope will be successful, and allow to us market

      22      Thousand Islands region waterfront activity more

      23      aggressively next year.

      24             Third, one aspect of the Thousand Islands is

      25      quite different from many other areas of the state.







                                                                   205
       1             It's a vacation-home destination.

       2             According to the U.S. census, Jefferson

       3      County has 10,800 vacation homes, representing about

       4      19 percent of its housing stock.

       5             In total, Jefferson, St. Lawrence, and Oswego

       6      county have 22,000 vacation homes, while the

       7      Lake Ontario south-shore counties have about 5700 in

       8      total.

       9             But across the area, we're talking about,

      10      that's 27,000 vacation homes.

      11             The majority of these homes are on the

      12      waterfront.

      13             They boasted the property-tax base in

      14      shoreline communities, some of which actually have

      15      more seasonal homes than permanent homes.

      16             They usually support a wide range of

      17      businesses, and contribute significantly to both

      18      employment and local sales income.

      19             This year, much of that activity was

      20      curtailed due to a variety of impacts from the high

      21      water.

      22             Despite this year's weather challenge,

      23      tourism trends in the region are strong.

      24             Our 2016 survey of businesses showed the

      25      highest level of business confidence in 20 years.







                                                                   206
       1             Response to our marketing has indicated

       2      strong visitor interest, even in 2017.

       3             And the results from the late summer, after

       4      the water went down, seem to be bearing out the fact

       5      that we can have a good solid season absent the

       6      water.

       7             Attraction attendance and hotel occupancy

       8      have been growing steadily.

       9             New tourism-based businesses are opening, and

      10      established operators are making fresh investments.

      11             The region's craft beverage and egg tourism

      12      businesses have expanded, helping to extend the

      13      traditional season well into the fall.

      14             For example, between 2010 and 2016,

      15      annualized employment in Jefferson County's

      16      hospitality businesses grew, from 3880 jobs, to

      17      4,346 jobs.

      18             That's 466 new North Country jobs, with an

      19      additional $17 million in annual wages.

      20             More than a decade ago, I served on the

      21      technical workgroup, looking at management plan's

      22      impacts on recreational boating and tourism.

      23             At the time, the existing plan did not

      24      formally take into account recreational boating, nor

      25      any other impacts of water levels on tourism.







                                                                   207
       1             Essentially, people who depend upon

       2      water-based tourism in the region were not part of

       3      the formula at that -- in the 1958 formula.

       4             A couple of things came out of that technical

       5      workgroup that I want to point out.

       6             They did a study of recreational boating on

       7      Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence, and, in 2002,

       8      estimated that $429.7 million was spent on

       9      recreational boating trips in the basin.

      10             They also found that the greatest incremental

      11      gains to recreational boating, when you talked about

      12      all those plans, were if higher water levels were

      13      achieved in the fall.

      14             So there's a couple takeaways from that

      15      workgroup that I think are still valid today.

      16             First, there's real economic impact from

      17      tourism and recreation to consider in this

      18      conversation.

      19             The plan limits tourism considerations to

      20      recreational boating.  The vacation-home values and

      21      trade waterfront businesses are impacted by the

      22      management plan as well.

      23             Second, much of the spending tracked in 2002

      24      was concentrated in smaller communities.  And water

      25      levels have critical impacts on those small resort







                                                                   208
       1      communities which have water-based tourism as their

       2      core economic driver; that is to say, the

       3      concentration of dollar losses in small communities

       4      creates much more stress on that community than in

       5      communities with larger populations and more diverse

       6      economies.

       7             Third, although we're dealing with high water

       8      this year, the most negative impacts to boating and

       9      tourism over time have been due to low water in the

      10      fall.

      11             In several recent years, every low water --

      12      early low water has curtailed boating activity, and

      13      led to closing of seasonal homes, and loss of

      14      businesses at marinas.

      15             What can the State do?

      16             Please recognize that tourism is an important

      17      and growing part of a fragile North Country economy.

      18      It depends heavily on the lake and the river.

      19             Tourism's overall use of the water system

      20      should be a significant consideration formulating

      21      policies about the system's management.

      22             Please recognize that our reputation as a

      23      desirable waterfront destination is one of our most

      24      precious assets.

      25             Simply put, please don't scare off the







                                                                   209
       1      tourists when a flood is happening.

       2             And please keep in mind that different areas

       3      have different needs.  Craft policies with the

       4      flexibility to accommodate those needs.

       5             For instance, the 5-mile-per-hour, no-wake,

       6      boating rule stayed into place long after waters had

       7      dropped on the St. Lawrence River.

       8             And within 600 feet on the St. Lawrence

       9      River, it's very difficult to navigate at 5 miles an

      10      hour.

      11             So, although that may -- it made sense

      12      with -- as an abundance of caution in some areas, we

      13      ended up finding frustrated boaters who were being

      14      ticketed for normal operations of their boat under

      15      normal conditions on the river.

      16             Thank you for your time.

      17             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Just one question, Gary.

      18             Do you think something has to be done as far

      19      as marketing early on this spring so that

      20      individuals know that it's okay to come back?

      21             GARY DeYOUNG:  Right.

      22             We applied for that grant, and the idea is,

      23      we'd get out on social media and really tell

      24      individual stories about how individual businesses

      25      have recovered, or how experiences can still be







                                                                   210
       1      enjoyed even though you may have heard differently.

       2             But to be candid, if the State can help.

       3             After "Superstorm Sandy," there were special

       4      federal funds that were heavily spent by the State

       5      to promote Long Island, the Adirondacks, and the

       6      Catskill regions.

       7             I haven't heard any kind of plans to make a

       8      special focus on the Lake Ontario counties in the

       9      wake of this flood.

      10             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  A couple of questions.

      12             Have you heard from your member businesses,

      13      any specific or generalized complaints about the

      14      process of the business going after grants?

      15             You know, I've heard a lot of anecdotal

      16      issues on that, but, what have you been hearing from

      17      your members about that process?

      18             GARY DeYOUNG:  I haven't heard that.

      19             And, you know, we did the survey, and the

      20      survey has, literally, dozens of comments about what

      21      they experienced specifically as a business, and how

      22      they were coping with it.  But we didn't ask about

      23      if they were having any success with getting the

      24      grants.

      25             SENATOR O'MARA:  Where were your -- where was







                                                                   211
       1      the consensus of your membership on Plan 2014 before

       2      it was implemented?

       3             GARY DeYOUNG:  Well, you know, there's a

       4      difference, I think, from what I heard, and this is

       5      just my anecdotal listening on the street, we depend

       6      heavily on fishing and wildlife biology, you know.

       7             So, when we were told that this new plan

       8      would really help the fishery, I think it won a lot

       9      of supporters.

      10             Now, maybe some of the testimony today calls

      11      that into question.

      12             So I think, especially on the river, there

      13      was a feeling that, if we got a little bit of extra

      14      water in the fall, and then have those low-water

      15      years, where people are hauling out at the end of

      16      August and leaving town, and, if the fishery

      17      improved, and we could get in the spring and really

      18      attract more fishermen, that was a pretty good deal.

      19             So I think there was a lot of hope for

      20      Plan 2014.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much.

      22                  [Applause.]

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  Next, Scott Aubertine,

      24      supervisor of the town of Lyme.

                                                                   212
       1      Richie, Assemblymen Oaks and Barclay, thank you for

       2      the invitation to speak here tonight.

       3             Thank you for this opportunity to share the

       4      thoughts and opinions of myself, and I believe those

       5      of the majority of the residents of the town of

       6      Lyme.

       7             The town of Lyme is located in Jefferson

       8      County.

       9             The western side of our town is defined by

      10      beautiful Lake Ontario.

      11             The year-round population, according to the

      12      2010 census, was a whopping 2,185, and more than

      13      doubles in the summer due to a large seasonal

      14      population.

      15             We are comprised of the hamlet of Three Mile

      16      Bay and the village of Chaumont, both located on

      17      Chaumont Bay, which, at one time, we promoted as the

      18      largest freshwater bay in the world.

      19             We have since been argued at by residents of

      20      Georgian Bay in Huron who says they are the largest.

      21             So -- but we will gladly accept recognition

      22      as the second or third largest fresh-water bay in

      23      the world.

      24             We are confident, however, that with over

      25      55 miles of shoreline, the town of Lyme has the most







                                                                   213
       1      shoreline of any town in New York State.

       2             Allow me to tell you a little about myself,

       3      and, thereby, hopefully, expressing the thinking of

       4      our town residents.

       5             I have lived in the town of Lyme all my life.

       6             In high school, and after, I hunted ducks and

       7      geese regularly.

       8             As I grew older and began raising a family,

       9      I dedicated myself to serving the community and town

      10      that I love and have lived in all my life.

      11             I worked for five years for the Town of Lyme

      12      Highway Department, and for the past 30 years, at

      13      Township Telephone Company, the local telephone

      14      company serving the towns of Lyme, Brownville, and

      15      Cape Vincent, and the three islands of Carrollton,

      16      Fox, and Grenadier.

      17             I mention this to emphasize my experience in

      18      having seen the extensive shorelines in those towns,

      19      and my regular interaction with shoreline residents,

      20      and our residents in general.

      21             I have served on the Lyme Central School

      22      Board, the Chaumont Village Board, my church

      23      session, and now town supervisor for the last

      24      10 years.

      25             I feel I have a pretty good understanding of







                                                                   214
       1      the pulse of our town residents.

       2             Having been a young boy in the '50s and

       3      '60s, I was unaware of Plan 1958D.

       4             I did not understand the purpose of the

       5      Moses-Saunders Dam until a middle school field trip

       6      there in the late '60s.

       7             However, as a senior in 1973, which I think

       8      was the year of the previous high-water record for

       9      Lake Ontario, I worked several weekends helping

      10      shoreline residents fill sandbags.

      11             From those days, on, I paid attention to some

      12      of the comments of long-time residents and the many

      13      commercial fishermen we had living and working in

      14      our town.

      15             I'm not sure how many people were familiar

      16      with Plan 1958D, but I can assure you that when

      17      water levels changed noticeably, everyone knew that

      18      they were playing with the water levels again.

      19             Whenever the water levels went up or down,

      20      people said, Must be the people in Rochester or

      21      Montreal are unhappy about the water levels.

      22             There is no denying that the creeks and

      23      marshes that used to have water in them have dried

      24      up.

      25             This spring we saw water running in creeks







                                                                   215
       1      that we haven't seen since the 1970s.

       2             With water levels rising nearly 3 feet this

       3      spring, I heard many long-time residents say, that

       4      if the water went down about a foot and a half, the

       5      water levels would be at what they were in the '70s.

       6             It is strange, though, that in the last

       7      10 years, we have noticed a distinct increase in our

       8      wildlife population.  We are seeing animals never

       9      seen years ago.

      10             In addition to increased deer and turkey

      11      populations, we now have eagles, beaver, raccoon,

      12      porcupine, geese, heron, osprey, minks, and fishers.

      13             I've been told the DEC denies the existence

      14      of panthers and bobcats, but we have seen them and

      15      they have been photographed.

      16             I will admit, however, that the duck

      17      population is lower than in the past.

      18             Since the intent of the plan was to help

      19      restore plant diversity and habitat for fish, it is

      20      hard to determine if Plan 2014 factors into our

      21      increased wildlife population, considering that the

      22      creeks, marshes, and swamps only returned or saw

      23      increased water levels this spring.

      24             Restored wildlife was also an intent of the

      25      plan, although we have noticed the increase in







                                                                   216
       1      wildlife long before 2014.

       2             In reading the website of the

       3      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Plan 2014,

       4      it states that:

       5             "Plan 2014 is designed to provide for more

       6      natural variations of water levels of Lake Ontario

       7      and the St. Lawrence River that are needed to

       8      restore echo-health system.

       9             "It will continue to moderate extreme high

      10      and low levels, better maintain systemwide levels

      11      for navigation, frequently extend the recreational

      12      boating season, and slightly increase hydropower

      13      production."

      14             According to the website homepage, one of the

      15      purposes of the plan is to protect against high

      16      water levels.

      17             That certainly was not the case this spring.

      18             Also, our recreational boating and tourism

      19      levels were painfully low this summer.

      20             I received many calls from seasonal residents

      21      in the spring, wondering how the water levels were.

      22             I had several mention that they weren't going

      23      to bother coming to their summer cottage.

      24             We understand the diverse interest of coastal

      25      development, hydropower production, improving







                                                                   217
       1      conditions for commercial navigation, increasing

       2      commercial business opportunities and recreational

       3      boating.

       4             We cannot argue with 16 years worth of

       5      extensive studies performed by professional water

       6      managers, environmentalists, and engineers.

       7             I am not sure when the process of raising

       8      water levels, according to Plan 2014, began;

       9      however, last summer, we had a drought and the lake

      10      levels were low.

      11             Usually, Mother Nature takes care of herself.

      12             Trying to keep the lake levels up this

      13      spring appears to have gone against the plans of

      14      Mother Nature.

      15             With heavy wet snowfalls last winter, and

      16      more than average rainfall this spring, it appears

      17      Mother Nature intended to correct last summer's

      18      drought.

      19             Trying to set higher water levels this

      20      spring, in an effort to follow through with

      21      Plan 2014 initiatives, may not have been a good

      22      decision.

      23             The phrase "It's not nice to fool with

      24      Mother Nature" has been quoted quite often in our

      25      little lakeside town.







                                                                   218
       1             The high water levels not only caused

       2      property damage, soil erosion, and stress among the

       3      residents, but the impact on our volunteer fire

       4      department members and budgets was substantial.

       5             The Chaumont Volunteer Fire Department

       6      incurred unplanned and unbudgeted expenses during

       7      the 2017 flooding, which included 2,620 total

       8      volunteer manhours, and $2,460 for meal expenses,

       9      and $7,342 for equipment and supplies for sandbag

      10      details.

      11             Additionally, the Three Mile Bay Fire

      12      Department responded to 56 flood-related incidents

      13      and sandbag details, totaling 781 volunteer manhours

      14      in May and June.

      15             Sandbag totals exceeded 8,000 sandbags placed

      16      by fire department personnel.  And that is about

      17      equal for both of them.

      18             An additional, unbudgeted, 138 gallons of

      19      fuel was used for fire department vehicles, and

      20      80 gallons were used for fire chief and deputy chief

      21      vehicles, totaling 218 unplanned and unbudgeted

      22      gallons of fuel.

      23             The Three Mile Bay Fire Department Auxiliary

      24      provided over 100 meals to fire, EMS, and New York

      25      State employees, exceeding $700.







                                                                   219
       1             The contracting for tractor-trailer delivery

       2      of sandbags to residents totaled 460 miles and $920.

       3             In addition to these figures, both fire

       4      departments were the ones who began the operation of

       5      filling sandbags by hand.

       6             This work was performed each evening, for

       7      about two weeks or more, before we could get

       8      Senator Richie, and Graham and her staff, National

       9      Guard, Cape Vincent Correctional Facility, and

      10      New York State DOT to assist in the operation of the

      11      sandbag center, which I reiterate and emphasize, was

      12      initiated by us at the Town of Lyme, the Lyme

      13      Highway Department, and the two fire departments --

      14      yeah, initiated by us at the Town of Lyme, the

      15      highway department, and the two fire departments.

      16             Enough cannot be said to commend everyone

      17      involved for the services they performed.

      18             Approximately 80,000 sandbags came out of our

      19      facility.

      20             The Town of Lyme Highway Department costs

      21      were also substantial.

      22             Charges for labor were $96,981, materials

      23      totaled 19,186, and diesel fuel and gas amounted to

      24      2,856.

      25             We rented an excavator for $3,300, because







                                                                   220
       1      ours broke down while we were placing the big rocks

       2      on the Point Peninsula isthmus.

       3             If it wasn't for the little road going from

       4      the mainland to Point Peninsula, Point Peninsula

       5      would be an island.

       6             This was done to follow the recommendations

       7      of the Army Corps of Engineers.

       8             So while we were doing that, our excavator

       9      broke down, and we are gonna have to pay about

      10      $12,000 to have that repaired.

      11             Although some of those expenditures would

      12      have occurred through normal operations, by no means

      13      would they have been as high as they were.

      14             If you talked to the average town of Lyme

      15      resident on the street, most likely, you will hear

      16      them say that the intent of Plan 2014 allowing for

      17      slightly higher water levels in Lake Ontario, in an

      18      effort to replenish marshes, streams, and wildlife,

      19      may be a good one.

      20             Obviously, this past spring, it did not work

      21      out to the benefit of anyone, and only caused severe

      22      property, shoreline, economic, and environmental

      23      disaster.

      24             Let's hope it doesn't happen again.

      25             Thank you.

       1                  [Applause.]

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  Patty.

       3             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I'd just like to start off

       4      by commending you and your local government.

       5             I know you were one of the first

       6      municipalities who had things in place when

       7      residents started calling, you know, far above many

       8      other municipalities in making sure the sandbags

       9      were available.

      10             You know, when we stopped to look at your

      11      operation, and you actually had cones upside down

      12      and two boards, and filling sandbags that way, you

      13      know, I think that we should acknowledge the fact

      14      that you really were prepared, and tried to get to

      15      the residents as soon as possible.

      16             With that, I know that you said it was two

      17      weeks before anyone really kicked in from the state

      18      level.

      19             So I guess my one question is:  What else

      20      could we do at the state level to help get the

      21      resources to you faster?

      22             What were you lacking in getting for help

      23      from the State?

      24             SCOTT AUBERTINE:  I really think that

      25      everyone worked as well as they could, as quickly as







                                                                   222
       1      they could.  I know things don't happen overnight.

       2             I declared a state of emergency on May 2nd,

       3      I think it was, at noon.  And Governor Cuomo

       4      declared his at 3:00 or so.  So, we beat him by a

       5      few hours.

       6             But, I think everybody did the best they

       7      could.

       8             You know, thank God for our fire departments,

       9      who were the ones that came one the idea of putting

      10      the cones upside down.

      11             And, you know, we have to thank the Cape

      12      Correctional Facility, and -- because we were taking

      13      sand down to them, and their inmates were filling

      14      sandbags also.

      15             I think everything was done fairly well.

      16             I don't know how long it takes to get the

      17      National Guard there.

      18             I was actually please they showed up as

      19      quickly as they did.

      20             So I think things went as well as they could

      21      have.

      22             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      23             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you very much.

      24             And thank you to our great fire departments

      25      that we have throughout all of our communities here.







                                                                   223
       1             So, we rely on them so much.

       2             SCOTT AUBERTINE:  Thank you.

       3                  [Technical difficulties.]

       4                  [No audio or video.]

       5             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  (No audio or video)...

       6      Lake Ontario, and, more specifically, the south

       7      shore.

       8             A lot of my thunder was taken by Dr. Frank.

       9      A lot of his comments were my comments.

      10             I promise, if we do this again, I will call

      11      him, so that we can coordinate what we're gonna talk

      12      about, and so we don't repeat the same stuff.

      13             But let me start by giving you a little bit

      14      of my background.

      15             I've been a lakeshore riparian since 1985.

      16      My wife's family's been down there for four

      17      generations since the 1940s.

      18             Our houses were not recently built.  They may

      19      have been remodeled, but my house, I date it back to

      20      at least 1940.

      21             My wife's family has a house that was back

      22      probably into the '20s.

      23             But, I became a -- very involved with

      24      lake-level issues in the spring of 1993.

      25             During that high water period, my breakwall







                                                                   224
       1      was damaged, and I went through, you know, all kind

       2      of contortions to get the permits.

       3             But -- so after that, I attended many

       4      Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence River Board of Control

       5      meetings on behalf of my neighborhood association.

       6             In 1999, I was asked to serve as a member of

       7      the public-interest advisory group as part of the

       8      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study.

       9             Within a year, I was chair of the public

      10      interest advisory group, and, as well, becoming a

      11      member of the study board.  I oversaw the whole

      12      entire study.

      13             I was also co-author of the minority report

      14      on the study.  Myself and Dr. Frank are the

      15      authors of it.

      16             Presently, I represent my neighborhood

      17      association on lake-level issues, and I'm a director

      18      of Lake Ontario Riparian Alliance, which is

      19      committed to getting rid of Plan 2014.

      20             As a member of the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence

      21      River Study, let me state, as Dr. Frank said, Plan

      22      2014 was not a plan proposed by the study, as the

      23      IJC would let you -- lead you to believe.  The

      24      environmental plan proposed, as Dr. Frank said,

      25      was Plan B+.  It was entirely different.







                                                                   225
       1             And they stated that they would not implement

       2      it -- they would like to implement it, but because

       3      of the excessive damages it caused, they couldn't.

       4             But, in hindsight, it might have been better,

       5      because at least the damages would have been spread.

       6             With Plan 2014, the damages are concentrated

       7      on the riparians and businesses, primarily along the

       8      south shore, whose population constitutes the

       9      weakest of all the interests involved with the lake

      10      and the river.

      11             Unlike the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River

      12      Study, which was relatively transparent, 2014 was

      13      developed by closed-door committee, populated by

      14      members that came from government agencies only,

      15      mostly environmental agencies from both New York and

      16      Canadian provinces.

      17             In the references in the back, I actually

      18      have the list of the first members of that group.

      19             The entities -- the agency stayed the same,

      20      but the people might have changed over the course of

      21      the workings of that group.

      22             We do know, however, that they did consult

      23      with environmental groups that wanted Plan B that

      24      was put out by the Lake Ontario study, but there was

      25      no representation for recreational boaters or







                                                                   226
       1      homeowners on this committee.

       2             They first proposed, as you've heard already,

       3      Plan Bv7, which is Plan 2014 without trigger levels.

       4             Plan Bv7 caused substantial damages on the

       5      lake and on the lower river.

       6             Indeed, we learned from a person involved

       7      with this committee that representatives from the

       8      province of Quebec stated they would not accept any

       9      new regulation plan that caused more damage on the

      10      lower river than occurred with the old plan.

      11             Thus, the committee moved the damages

      12      primarily to the south shore of Lake Ontario without

      13      regard to the remediation of these damages.

      14             Plan 2014 took away the board's ability to

      15      deviate from the regulation plan until the trigger

      16      levels were surpassed.

      17             These trigger levels are at extremes, and

      18      do not represent any of the ideal water levels

      19      proposed by the technical worker groups of the

      20      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study.

      21             And in the references in the back, there's

      22      actually a chart that shows what the levels were.

      23      And the highest level that was asked for was 247.3.

      24             The highest level with Plan 2014, the highest

      25      trigger, is 248.1.







                                                                   227
       1             A recent newsletter article that was in a

       2      Rochester paper, that stated that there was

       3      1.3 trillion gallons of water at its high point on

       4      the lake in late May or early June.

       5             This amount only reinforces the fact that the

       6      board is not allowed to deviate when it comes --

       7      when it sees excess water coming into the system

       8      from either Lake Erie or from the local basin.

       9             Many of us on the south shore believe that

      10      with -- if it was under the old plan, the board

      11      might have been able to anticipate and take some

      12      action.

      13             While it may not have done much to change

      14      what happened this year, at least it would have been

      15      better doing nothing than being stuck due to issues

      16      with Ottawa River flows.

      17             Let me give you this analogy, think of this:

      18             If you're going down the expressway at

      19      60 miles an hour, and the car in front is stopping,

      20      but under the new rules of the road, you can't stop

      21      and apply the breaks until you were 20 feet away.

      22             It's a little too late, and you ignore the

      23      facts, telling you what is coming.

      24             Plan 2014 triggers are set way too high

      25      during wet seasons and too low during dry seasons.







                                                                   228
       1             Attached as a reference also on this paper,

       2      is a spreadsheet created by one of my neighbors's

       3      college kids.

       4             It's important -- the important message that

       5      we learned from this is that, if the board was able

       6      to deviate when the lake was a foot above average at

       7      the end of the February, beginning of March, the

       8      lake may not have reached the levels experienced.

       9             By increasing outflows by a minimum of

      10      300 cubic meters per second, the effect would have

      11      lowered the lake between 3 to 9 inches by

      12      April 19th, the day the flooding began in Montreal

      13      due to the high water flows in the Ottawa River.

      14             I want to put a caveat on that.

      15             We're still working on the calculations.  We

      16      still have to factor in the ice-formation periods

      17      that took place in February and March.

      18             As I stated already, Plan 2014 does not allow

      19      the board to deviate for the lake until triggers are

      20      reached, so this oversupply will occur more often on

      21      the lake.

      22             Based on IJC data itself, levels above 247,

      23      which is the level that causes flooding on the south

      24      shore, will occur 300 percent more often with

      25      Plan 2014 than with the old Plan '58DD.







                                                                   229
       1             Going forward, if there is no change in the

       2      trigger levels in the spring conditions, the spring

       3      conditions will be ripe for recurrence of this

       4      year's crisis.

       5             The Ottawa River's two-part freshets are a

       6      known factor occurring every mid-April to mid-May.

       7             The Plan 2014 triggers present us with the

       8      danger, regardless of how the lake got this high,

       9      whether it was the excess precipitation or

      10      Plan 2014.  But Plan 2014 will continue to cause

      11      damage to this lakeshore line.

      12             A lot of this damage was not included in the

      13      Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study.

      14             The costs included were damages to shoreline

      15      protection.

      16             Public lands, public infrastructure, private

      17      properties on embankments like Sodus Bay were not

      18      included.

      19             Facts on property-tax assessments were shoved

      20      under the rug.

      21             In addition, where the money to retrofit the

      22      shore to the higher levels was not investigated.

      23             Who's going to pay for retrofitting the south

      24      shore?

      25             Moneys that the State has already allocated







                                                                   230
       1      may not be sufficient to help the 10,000 properties

       2      along the south shore.

       3             The IJC went as far to say that we're not

       4      being damaged, it's a reduction of benefits; thus,

       5      getting around the requirement of the boundary

       6      (indiscernible) and make whole any interests damaged

       7      by any IJC decision.

       8             So let me conclude by circling back to where

       9      I began and became involved with the lake issues.

      10             Back in 1993, as I previously stated, my

      11      breakwall was damaged.

      12             In the process of redesigning, I took into

      13      consideration the operating range used by the board

      14      of control at that time; that being, between 243.3

      15      to 247.3.

      16             With this -- with information obtained from

      17      the Army Corps of Engineers, I learned that

      18      80 percent of the waves hitting my house -- or, my

      19      shore were 6 feet or less.  So I built my protection

      20      at 253.5 feet.

      21             The cost to do this was over $75,000.

      22             I'm presently looking to modify my breakwall

      23      to increase its height.

      24             The problem is, Plan 2014 does not have no

      25      upper limit.







                                                                   231
       1             Additionally, with Plan 2000 -- with --

       2      additionally, with Plan '58DD, my property boundary

       3      was set at the upper limit of the range, at 247.3.

       4             With Plan 2014, again, there is no upper

       5      limit.

       6             So where is my property line, and who's going

       7      to pay for the property being taken by the

       8      government?

       9             And I thank you for letting me put my input

      10      in.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      12             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  And, a little dry mouth.

      13             So, sorry for that.

      14             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Thanks for your

      15      testimony.

      16             And, actually, you started hitting on it at

      17      the very end.

      18             Has your association investigated any kind of

      19      legal action, as far as the taking by the government

      20      on this?

      21             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  Well, the problem that

      22      occurs there is, who do you sue?

      23             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  What's that?

      24             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  Who do you sue?

      25             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Well, the federal







                                                                   232
       1      government, I suppose.

       2             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  I mean, we've looked at

       3      that.

       4             There's been other members of our groups that

       5      were involved with the lawsuit back in the '80s.

       6             They spent $80,000, and they got the right to

       7      go to next stage, which is the discovery stage.

       8             We can't afford it.

       9             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Yeah.

      10             I wonder if it's possible to get other

      11      associations along the lake to -- work together

      12      to --

      13             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  I know that there are

      14      other groups looking it.

      15             But, you can't sue the IJC because they're a

      16      treaty organization.

      17             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Right.

      18             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  The federal government,

      19      I doubt will -- you know, who you gonna go after in

      20      the federal government?

      21             ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY:  Interesting.

      22             Thanks.

      23             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  Thank you.

      24             SENATOR O'MARA:  Can you explain to me what

      25      you mean, you said towards the end:  The problem is







                                                                   233
       1      Plan 2014 has no set upper range limit?

       2             What do you mean by that?

       3             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  '58D had a range.

       4             The range on 2014, just, it can go to 249

       5      again.

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Within the plan itself?

       7             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  There's no set limits.

       8                  [Indiscernible audience comments.]

       9             SENATOR O'MARA:  Do you have any questions?

      10             Who ultimately approved Plan 2014 on the

      11      United States side?

      12             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  The Department of State,

      13      I believe.  The Federal Department of State.

      14             SENATOR O'MARA:  Just the Secretary of State?

      15             DR. DAN BARLETTA:  Yes.

      16             SENATOR O'MARA:  Okay.

      17             Thank you.

      18             Next up is Cathleen Goodnough from Green

      19      Point Marina.

      20             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  Assemblymen, Senators.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  Good evening.

      22             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  Thank you for the

      23      invitation to speak.

      24             My name is Cathleen Goodnough, and I'm one of

      25      the business owners of Green Point Marina, Mobile







                                                                   234
       1      Home Park.

       2             SENATOR O'MARA:  If you could get a little

       3      closer to the mic, please.

       4             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  I'm sorry.

       5             It's been in my family and operating for over

       6      112 years.

       7             We own a unique peninsula consisting of

       8      212 acres located in North Sandy Pond in Upstate

       9      New York.

      10             Our business is seasonal and run by myself,

      11      my sister Cheryl Yerson, and our mother

      12      Linda Goodnough.

      13             This year the high water levels have left our

      14      138-site mobile home park and 95-slip marina

      15      devastated.

      16             We were warned April 18th that the water

      17      levels would be up high, and the high winds would be

      18      expected until mid-May.

      19             Nothing could have prepared us for the height

      20      of the water levels and the length of the time that

      21      we were flooded.

      22             We spent hours and days picking up shoreline

      23      debris; parts, tools, in the shop; walking along the

      24      shoreline to secure trees; picking up our people's

      25      furniture and other items that could float away and







                                                                   235
       1      become a hazard in the water.

       2             Our main marina building had standing water

       3      for over 60 days straight.

       4             We worked in hip boots daily.

       5             Our people in the park could not use their

       6      seasonal residence as the water surrounded most, and

       7      covered their septics.

       8             Roads were flooded with over 9 inches of

       9      water.

      10             We have 33 private landowners that have a

      11      right-of-way over our road to reach their

      12      properties.  Many evacuated.  Some stayed to protect

      13      their homes.

      14             Access to their home and our business was

      15      priority.

      16             Along with providing access for fire and

      17      ambulance services for anyone that stayed, we had to

      18      close our road for over a week, and this led to us

      19      building up the road with over 4500 sandbags.  And

      20      that was hauling in 26 trucks of 20-ton stone to

      21      bring the road up out of the water.

      22             The main building of over 3200 square feet

      23      has been completely emptied of a vast inventory of

      24      parts and moved to rental containers.

      25             Our concrete floors have heaved and cracked







                                                                   236
       1      and caused major destruction.

       2             We monitor the water levels in the spring to

       3      prepare for our docks to be repaired.

       4             This year we have photos.

       5             March 30th, the water level was a foot below

       6      our docks.

       7             April 1st, the water was a foot below the

       8      docks.

       9             And April 5th, it was at the bottom of the

      10      docks.

      11             That's a foot in four days.

      12             April 14th, we raised our docks 13 inches out

      13      of the water, and April 24th, the docks were

      14      underwater.

      15             In essence, that's over 24 inches/2 feet in

      16      24 days.

      17             While we understand we had a very wet spring,

      18      when reviewing the outflows from the IJC on

      19      April 13th, they were 7700 cubic meters, and on

      20      April 24th, 7800 cubic meters, respectively.

      21             With the difference of 2-foot already being

      22      seen on our shorelines, we did wonder why the

      23      outflows were not at the maximum of 10,200 cubic

      24      meters.

      25             There is no escaping water.  It goes







                                                                   237
       1      everywhere, and left in an enclosed building for

       2      over 60 days, we had black mold, wet insulation,

       3      soggy, wet wood shelves, and wet walls.

       4             Our days would start out by, what can we get

       5      done today?

       6             And the main business that we count on to

       7      survive stopped altogether.

       8             There were no customers, there was no

       9      business, there was no foot-track of any kind, and

      10      we felt very displaced.

      11             We should have been preparing boats to be

      12      ready, our seasonal snack bar for people to enjoy.

      13             Instead, we had to focus daily on picking up

      14      wet, soggy wood, insulation, save what we could in

      15      inventory, and move everything into three storage

      16      containers and a workshop to save it.

      17             We flooded the worst on June 1st with the

      18      water levels of 248.9.

      19             If the IJC trigger levels are to remain at

      20      248.13 for June 1st of next year, we cannot imagine

      21      how we will remain in business if this new Plan 2014

      22      is not modified.

      23             June, historically, the month of high water.

      24      And we also have Lake Ontario right to the west of

      25      us.  And when the wind blows, we can see a







                                                                   238
       1      difference in the water levels of almost 2 feet if

       2      the west wind blows heavy for more than a few days.

       3             We were very fortunate to be backed by

       4      Pathfinder Bank, and they have waived our principal

       5      payments on our mortgage, totaling over 36,000.

       6             They've also extended a line of credit, for

       7      up to $100,000, to make repairs needed on our

       8      building.

       9             Thus far, we have received little or no help

      10      from funding from anyone.

      11             We have put in for the grants available to

      12      us, but you have to expense the money first.

      13             We have made many calls to Governor Cuomo's

      14      office to find out if this area has been declared a

      15      federal disaster so that FEMA might come in.

      16             And we have received very little insurance

      17      for our flood damage to our building.

      18             And to date, we have expensed over $50,000

      19      already, and our marina receipts are down over

      20      $120,000.

      21             Our entire summer was non-existent, and our

      22      residents have major concerns that this is going to

      23      be the new normal.

      24             On October 2, 19 -- or, 2017, the media

      25      release from the IJC states "The board will assist







                                                                   239
       1      with boat haul-outs from Lake St. Lawrence by

       2      decreasing water flows."

       3             With the consideration to assist them, one

       4      wonders where the consideration or assistance was

       5      for the entire southern shore of Lake Ontario.

       6             And also stated in this release "The board

       7      urges everyone to be prepared to live within the

       8      full range that have occurred in the past, and those

       9      that may occur in the future.  And based on that" --

      10      "historical observations, and projected for future

      11      conditions, at a minimum, Lake Ontario water levels

      12      are expected to range from a high of 248.95, to a

      13      low of 241.3, at infrequent intervals.

      14             If these levels remain the same and the

      15      trigger levels are not changed within the IJC, our

      16      business, and many other businesses and homeowners,

      17      will be under water again.

      18             Our property taxes are $58,000 a year, and

      19      33 private landowners have -- pay hefty taxes.

      20             On an average basis of 7,000 per private

      21      landowner, plus our taxes, it's $289,000.

      22             If the water levels remain high, and flooding

      23      occurs more frequently, the towns along the lake

      24      will no longer be able to count on the

      25      waterfront-property taxes that are a large







                                                                   240
       1      source of their revenue.

       2             Our property suffered massive erosion in and

       3      around our seven canals.

       4             We had several residents flood in their

       5      cabanas.

       6             Our campers were in eminent danger of being

       7      knocked off their cinder blocks with the high winds

       8      and the water levels.

       9             We have major concerns for the reconstruction

      10      of our property.

      11             We have miles of shoreline to be rebuilt, and

      12      breakwalls to build up, and fill to bring in to

      13      level the ground which is uneven from water sitting

      14      on it for over two months.

      15             If our business is to remain open, we need

      16      to:

      17             Raise our park road;

      18             Convert our 95 docks into floating docks;

      19             And raise the level of concrete in our shop,

      20      over 3200 square feet, up 7 inches;

      21             Raise the breakwalls;

      22             Repair existing rock breakwalls;

      23             Install a septic removal system throughout

      24      the park so that our tenants may use their places.

      25             This year we rented (indiscernible) for a few







                                                                   241
       1      tenants that came up to check on their places.

       2             Our tenants pay us lot rent to us each year,

       3      on a yearly basis, and most could not use their

       4      place this year.

       5             With little or no income coming in, and

       6      having to refund rental customers' dockage, trailer

       7      rentals, boat rentals, because we could not operate

       8      within the 248.9 water-level range, was extremely

       9      stressful.

      10             And we have so much devastation to our land

      11      and business, and no funding in sight to help

      12      prepare to live within these ranges.

      13             The funding we did apply for, through the

      14      loss of revenue, will be $50,000, if granted.

      15             And our business is not the only one that has

      16      suffered this year.

      17             Our neighborhood restaurants, bars, ice

      18      distributors, beer distributors, gas-sales vendors,

      19      local grocery stores, liquor stores,

      20      laundrymats (ph.)... the list goes on and on.

      21             They have all suffered a financial loss from

      22      the lack of people in our area.

      23             The State will see a decrease in their

      24      sales-tax revenue, as well as the County and the

      25      Town.







                                                                   242
       1             This year's water levels not only flooded

       2      businesses and homes, it hurt everyone in our

       3      community in some way.

       4             And from the joy and the pride we have of

       5      running a family business, to daily stress,

       6      uncertainty of finances, and actual horror of

       7      watching the water levels come up a foot, and then

       8      another foot, and then another foot, has left us

       9      with the determination to rebuild our business, but,

      10      also, to help to make change to the Plan 2014 so

      11      that our once beautiful land and barrier beaches

      12      that so many people enjoy, can be seen again.

      13             Thank you for the opportunity to express our

      14      opinion of the water levels of Lake Ontario.

      15             Our hope is that the IJC board and other

      16      governing agencies involved see the magnitude of

      17      desperation for the need to change the trigger

      18      levels of the Plan 2014.

      19                  [Applause.]

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      21             SENATOR RITCHIE:  I would just like to say

      22      that, when we talk about heartbreaking stories,

      23      I don't think anyone could convey how horrible the

      24      situation was at your marina.

      25             The fact that, where the parts were, you were







                                                                   243
       1      out there, over your knees in water, trying to go

       2      and get parts.  And every time we stopped, the

       3      situation got worse and worse and worse.

       4             So, the fact that you're here, and you're

       5      saying that you're looking forward to keeping the

       6      family business going, in itself, is a pretty

       7      amazing statement.

       8             I am concerned, when you said you haven't

       9      received any resources yet from the State.

      10             So --

      11             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  We did receive a phone

      12      call.  They are reviewing the application for the

      13      income loss of revenue.

      14             They're reviewing it.

      15             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Okay.  Will you keep me

      16      posted on that?

      17             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  I will.

      18             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

      19             CATHLEEN GOODNOUGH:  Thank you.

      20             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      21             Next we have Wendy and Mark LaLonde from

      22      Hutchinson's Boat Works.

      23             MARK LaLONDE:  (Inaudible) and thank you for

      24      inviting me.

      25             I thought that our situation was dire, and,







                                                                   244
       1      yet, compared to what I've just heard, you know, it

       2      was really not -- it was really nothing.

       3             But, I run -- own and run a full-service

       4      marina in Alexandria Bay, on the St. Lawrence

       5      River --

       6             SENATOR O'MARA:  Get a little closer to the

       7      mic, please.

       8             MARK LaLONDE:  I own and run a full-service

       9      marina in Alexandria Bay, on the St. Lawrence River,

      10      with my wife, Wendy.

      11             When we opened up at the beginning of January

      12      this year, all the indicators were, that we were

      13      going to have a banner year, possibly the best we've

      14      had since 2007, which was our last really good year

      15      in the marine business.

      16             I say that because, our pre-season sales were

      17      good.  We were talking to lots of prospects, and

      18      they were talking positively.

      19             We had a lot of hope for, you know, moving

      20      into the season.

      21             So we started launching boats toward the end

      22      of April, at kind of a slow pace, because the water

      23      was coming up and we didn't know how high it was

      24      gonna get.

      25             That pace continued to slow until the river







                                                                   245
       1      peaked out in the first part of June, and it came to

       2      a complete halt.

       3             We ended up with about 15 percent of our

       4      customers not going in the water at all.

       5             Our fuel dock was underwater.

       6             We lost Victoria Day weekend, Memorial Day

       7      weekend.  Partially opened the dock on June 18th.

       8             And, with the 5-mile-an-hour speed limit, a

       9      lot of our customers that were in, were keeping

      10      their boat at the dock, or, you know, running much

      11      slower.

      12             Our gas sales were off 46 percent;

      13             Retail labor was down 15 percent;

      14             Parts were down 8 percent;

      15             And dockage was down 8 percent.

      16             At the same time we were dealing with reduced

      17      revenues, we were struggling to keep our -- the

      18      vertical surfaces of our docks high enough so our

      19      customers' fenders had something to ride against.

      20             So, we built brackets to accomplish that.

      21             We spent, all together, about $90,000 on

      22      doing that, shoring up a seawall, filling one of our

      23      gravel parking lots with 14 loads of gravel, to turn

      24      it from a swimming pool back into a parking lot.

      25             So, that's what we're dealing with.







                                                                   246
       1             You know, nothing like some other people here

       2      are dealing with.

       3             We were able to borrow $100,000 from our

       4      local bank, to keep going.  And they're working with

       5      us on the repayment of that.

       6             All those boats that didn't go in the water,

       7      we're not going be winterizing.  They didn't pay for

       8      any dockage.  So there's about $40,000 more in lost

       9      sales there.

      10             That's all I have.

      11             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

      12             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Could I just ask, did you

      13      submit a grant application to the State?

      14             MARK LaLONDE:  Yes, we did.

      15             SENATOR RITCHIE:  And how is that going?

      16             MARK LaLONDE:  It's not doing anything yet.

      17             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Not doing anything yet.

      18             Okay.

      19             Thank you.

      20             MARK LaLONDE:  Thank you.

      21             SENATOR O'MARA:  How did you find that

      22      process of application?

      23             MARK LaLONDE:  My wife handled that, and she

      24      was talking about the detailed information that was

      25      required, and, you know, proof of payment for







                                                                   247
       1      everything that we were submitting.  And it was

       2      pretty grueling.

       3             SENATOR O'MARA:  Thank you.

       4             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Thank you.

       5             MARK LaLONDE:  Thank you.

       6                  [Applause.]

       7             SENATOR O'MARA:  Well, that concludes our

       8      hearing this evening.

       9             We thank you all for coming out, sticking

      10      through it.

      11             And we hope to have another one of these

      12      hearings in early November, further west down the

      13      lake.

      14             So, that will remain to be announced.

      15             But thank you all for your attention, and

      16      your coming out to help us try to get to the bottom

      17      of this.

      18             Thank you.

      19                  (Whereupon, at approximately 8:33 p.m.,

      20        the joint public hearing held before the New York

      21        State Senate Standing Committee on Environmental

      22        Conservation and the Standing Committee on

      23        Agriculture concluded, and adjourned.)
