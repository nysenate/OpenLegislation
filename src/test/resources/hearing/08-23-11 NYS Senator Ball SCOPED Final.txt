       1             SENATOR BALL:  Good morning.

       2             If we could just start with the Pledge of

       3      Allegiance, everybody, and then we'll get started.

       4             I pledge allegiance to the flag of the

       5      United States of America, and to the Republic for

       6      which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,

       7      with liberty and justice for all.

       8             I know that everybody is busy, so we're going

       9      to get started.

      10             We have a few more senators that are on their

      11      way, and making it to the North Country from the

      12      city, which can always be tough.  I know, in the

      13      reverse direction, I am late sometimes.

      14             I want to introduce Senator Krueger for a

      15      couple brief remarks.

      16             Before that, I'll just make a brief

      17      statement.

      18             You know, we're on the precipice of having a

      19      multi-billion dollar industry come in to the state

      20      of New York.

      21             And as a legislator, sometimes you sit at a

      22      table.  And specifically on this issue, those who

      23      are against fracking, very successfully, and very

      24      forcefully, present their side, their opinion.  And

      25      then the industry --
