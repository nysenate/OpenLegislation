       1             SENATOR DEFRANCISCO:  This is the third

       2      hearing of the joint committees of the

       3      Finance Committee and the Investigations and

       4      Taxation Committee [sic].

       5             And with me today are Senators George Maziarz

       6      and Senator David Valesky.

       7             Other senators will be here as the day goes

       8      on, but we do not want to hold up the speakers who

       9      have been gracious enough to provide us information

      10      that will help us in trying to find tax reforms that

      11      will be helpful to make New York State more

      12      competitive, and they're devoting their times here,

      13      so we don't want to hold them up.

      14             Secondly, we have two more hearings

      15      scheduled, one on October 3rd in Mineola,

      16      Long Island, and one in New York City on

      17      October 4th.

      18             We've already had one in Albany and Syracuse.

      19             I'm not going to give my prepared remarks,

      20      but the basic thrust of them are, that we have been

      21      trying to do things to make New York State more

      22      competitive.  I don't think anybody believes that

      23      we've done enough, in view of our ratings by various

      24      organizations, including the national Tax Foundation

      25      which rates us 50th in business-friendliness.
