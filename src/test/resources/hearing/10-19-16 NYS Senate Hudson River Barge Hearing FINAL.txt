       1             MAYOR GREG SCHMIDT:  I pledge allegiance to

       2      the United States of America, and to the republic

       3      for which it stands, one nation under God,

       4      indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

       5             Thank you.  The door is open.  How exciting.

       6             So I am Dr. Greg Schmidt, the Mayor of the

       7      Village of Croton-on-Hudson, and I just want to

       8      thank everybody for coming here today, and I want to

       9      thank Senator Terrence Murphy for sponsoring this

      10      public hearing tonight.  And I'm glad he came to

      11      Croton because Croton has been at the forefront, as

      12      many other river communities, in terms of helping to

      13      keep the Hudson River clean and viable and the

      14      economic resource that it really is.  And the

      15      biggest thing that we've worked on for many, many

      16      years is to keep it clean.

      17             Here in Croton, we've had the dump that was

      18      here from the early 1920s that finally shut down

      19      several years ago.  So we have a long history here

      20      in Croton of the environmental damage that has been

      21      done to this river.  So I'm very proud to see how

      22      many people have come out to really voice their

      23      concerns about this barge project.

      24             We are going to be hearing from many eloquent

      25      people tonight to tell us their concerns, but for







                                                                   5
       1      now, I'm going to turn it over to my dear friend and

       2      I'm very happy that he has led the charge on this,

       3      Senator Terrence Murphy.  Thank you very much.

       4             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, Mayor.

       5             [ Applause ]

       6             Thank you so much, Mayor, and thank you

       7      everybody for coming out here to tonight's hearing

       8      on the U.S. Coast Guard's proposed federal rule that

       9      establishing 10 -- or excuse me -- 16 new anchorage

      10      sites from Yonkers up to Kingston.  The Hudson River

      11      as we all know is one of the most cherished natural

      12      resources in the Hudson Valley.  It is crystal clear

      13      the public needs abundantly answers that we must

      14      have, and that's what tonight is all about, is about

      15      transparency.

      16             It was October -- I'm sorry, August 8 -- when

      17      we had our first press conference about finding out

      18      about these proposed anchorage sites, and we had

      19      immediately called the Coast Guard to find out what

      20      this was all about.  And unfortunately, I'm not sure

      21      if we have a representative here tonight from the

      22      Coast Guard, but I do know they were invited.

      23             We invited as many people as we could

      24      possibly do to get the answers that we are all

      25      concerned about.







                                                                   6
       1             I had the press conference on August 8, and I

       2      immediately put up a petition on my website, and

       3      within three weeks we had 1900 people sign up to

       4      figure out what this was all about.

       5             And this is the reason why we are here

       6      tonight.  Not only are we all looking for answers,

       7      and as your elected officials between the three of

       8      us represent close to 900,000 people within our

       9      districts combined.

      10             These are extremely important issues.

      11      Senator Sue Serino here, Senator David Carlucci and

      12      myself, we all have part of this with regards to the

      13      Hudson Valley, and there are a tremendous amount of

      14      answers we are all concerned about.

      15             I see a lot of elected officials here. County

      16      Legislator Testa, Mayor Catalina, Barbara

      17      Scuccimarra, Liam McLaughlin.

      18             I'm looking for all your input tonight and

      19      actually the public's input, so I look forward to a

      20      robust conversation tonight.  I do know we have a

      21      bunch of speakers.

      22             First of all, and I would just like to --

      23      I'm not sure where he went, but thank Mayor Schmidt

      24      for hosting us tonight.  It is awful kind of him and

      25      we've had multiple conversations about this, and we







                                                                   7
       1      are here tonight to find out some answers.

       2             So with all due respect, we are going to be

       3      on a tight timeframe, and I would just like to turn

       4      it over to my colleague Senator Sue Serino who came

       5      down here to be with us tonight.

       6             Thank you, Sue.

       7             SENATOR SERINO:  Thank you Senator Murphy and

       8      Senator Carlucci.

       9             I think it's so important for the public to

      10      have their voice heard.

      11             Public comment gets lost under the radar so

      12      often, and you really need to have your questions

      13      answered.

      14             I know myself, I had the opportunity to meet

      15      with the Coast Guard, and I can tell you, I have a

      16      lot more questions than I did before.  So I just

      17      think that it's fair for the public to be able to

      18      have their time with the Coast Guard and ask those

      19      questions directly.

      20             You know, as a mom, I worry about my children

      21      and my grandchildren having our beautiful majestic

      22      river to enjoy like I have for most of my life,

      23      boating on the river, and so many people rely on

      24      that resource.

      25             So I just want to say thank you to everyone







                                                                   8
       1      that is here tonight, our other elected officials,

       2      and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

       3             Thank you.

       4             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, Senator Serino.

       5             Senator Carlucci, thank you for being here.

       6             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Thank you, Senator Murphy,

       7      thank you, Senator Serino.

       8             I want to thank everyone that's here, the

       9      elected officials.  I know Assemblywoman Sandy Galef

      10      is here, Supervisor Monaghan from the Town of Stony

      11      Point.  Thank you for being here.

      12             And I thank each and every person for being

      13      here for this very important issue.

      14             For decades now, many of the people in this

      15      room, environmental advocates, local government

      16      leaders, have been working to clean up from the

      17      mistakes of prior generations.

      18             And that's why this hearing and this issue is

      19      so important because we've learned from the mistakes

      20      of the previous government, from the business

      21      interests that went up and down this river that we

      22      can't tread lightly on this issue.

      23             We've got to make sure that every I is

      24      dotted.  Every T is crossed.  No stone is left

      25      unturned.  Every question is answered.







                                                                   9
       1             That's why it really boils my blood that the

       2      Coast Guard is not here tonight at a Senate hearing

       3      to answer these important questions.

       4             That's the big problem here.  There is no

       5      transparency on this issue.  When I'm walking down

       6      the street in my district, people are asking

       7      questions and rightfully so.

       8             So I want to thank everyone that is here.  I

       9      think together if we continue our vigilance that

      10      we've done over the past few decades that we can

      11      once again enjoy the majesty of the Hudson River.

      12             And I have been working with the students at

      13      Ossining High School in collaboration with

      14      Riverkeeper, and we have been out there every week

      15      monitoring the river, testing the water quality of

      16      the river.  And our goal, our mission is to reopen

      17      the beach in Ossining so that the residents of the

      18      community can enjoy the beauty of our river.

      19             This river belongs to all of us.  So we've

      20      got to protect it vigorously so that generations to

      21      come, they don't look back and say, "What did you

      22      do?  What did you do?"

      23             And that's why we deserve answers.  We

      24      deserve every question to be answered, and I'm so

      25      grateful to everyone that's here tonight to make







                                                                   10
       1      sure we push, and we don't tread lightly on this

       2      very important decision.  Thank you.

       3             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you Senator Carlucci.

       4             Now I'd like to turn it over to my Chief of

       5      Staff Matt Slater who is going to introduce our

       6      guest speakers here tonight, and let us know that

       7      how we are doing.

       8             MATT SLATER:  I'm Matt Slater.  I'm Senator

       9      Murphy's Chief of Staff.  Thank you all for coming.

      10             Just some ground rules for this evening.  We

      11      do a very in-depth agenda with some fantastic

      12      speakers tonight.

      13             We are asking for five minutes for testimony

      14      and questions and answers for five minutes.  I do

      15      believe there is a timer here to keep us as best we

      16      can on time for everybody's sake.

      17             So I'm going to begin with our first speaker.

      18      Our first speaker is not here yet, but we'll go with

      19      the next speaker who Liam McLauglin, President of

      20      the City of Yonkers.

      21             LIAM McLAUGHLIN:  Thank you, Matt.

      22             Good evening, Senators.  And first I would

      23      like to start off by saying thank you for holding

      24      this very important public hearing and listening to

      25      constituencies about this terribly crucial issue.







                                                                   11
       1             I would also like to take a second to thank

       2      everyone for being here.  There's a very large

       3      crowd, a lot of people here showing how much the

       4      public cares about this issue.

       5             As was stated, I'm the Yonkers City Council

       6      president, Liam McLaughlin.

       7             Back in July, I was one of the first

       8      individuals to submit public comment against this

       9      proposal.

      10             And the proposed rule the United States Coast

      11      Guard is considering establishing new long-term

      12      anchorages along the Hudson River estuary from

      13      Yonkers to Kingston.  The Coast Guard is also

      14      contemplating a Yonkers anchorage extension that

      15      would cover approximately 715 acres for up to 16

      16      vessels with a draft of less than 35 feet for

      17      long-term usage which commercial tankers would

      18      basically use for rest stops.

      19             The rule would extend significantly the

      20      Hudson River anchorage grounds adjacent to the City

      21      of Yonkers and other locations in order to allow for

      22      increased shipping and on-river storage activities.

      23             UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER:  No way.

      24             LIAM HUDSON:  Yes.

      25             The proposal would effectively result in







                                                                   12
       1      continuous end-to-end barge traffic and parking

       2      along the entire-- nearly the entirety of our

       3      waterfront.

       4             Yonkers is garnering national acclaim for the

       5      work we've accomplished in rehabilitating our

       6      waterfront.

       7             In speaking to Yonkers residents, downtown

       8      business groups, environmental groups, residents,

       9      local marine pilots, marina users including

      10      paddlers, kayakers and rowers and members of the

      11      public who access our riverfront.

      12             It is clear the proposed rule would severely

      13      diminish the progress we have made in recent years.

      14             I'd like to get into the specifics of the

      15      proposed rule if I could.  And I apologize, I'm

      16      going read this quickly because there are a lot of

      17      people here.  But I think it's important stuff.

      18             SENATOR MURPHY:  Take your time.

      19             LIAM McLAUGHLIN:  Congress designated the

      20      Hudson River National Heritage Area Title IX of the

      21      Public Law 104-333 of 1996.  The state's Hudson

      22      River Greenway administers the heritage area on

      23      behalf of the National Park Services.

      24             As specified in the legislation, we recognize

      25      not only the history and importance of the river,







                                                                   13
       1      but the federal government assists the state and the

       2      communities of the Hudson River in protecting and

       3      preserving it for the benefit of the entire nation,

       4      especially through increased recreation and public

       5      access and regional intermunicipal and

       6      intergovernmental planning to increase economic

       7      development and vitality through tourism, not

       8      through industry.

       9             The proposed rule is simply irreconcilable

      10      with the adopted Hudson River Valley National

      11      Heritage Area Management Plan approved by the

      12      United States Secretary of the Interior which

      13      provides a pertinent part for the recognition,

      14      interpretation and most importantly the preservation

      15      of sites along the Hudson River.

      16             In fact, the rule flies in the face of the

      17      management plan's most important objective, which is

      18      to increase access to the river and provide

      19      long-term sustainable heritage tourism which has

      20      been a major economic engine for the City of Yonkers

      21      and the Hudson Valley and will be adversely impacted

      22      by these unsightly barges.

      23             The Hudson River Greenway strategy to

      24      implement the plan centers on six areas and at least

      25      three of the strategies, resource preservation,







                                                                   14
       1      recreational uses and community impact have

       2      apparently failed to be considered by the Coast

       3      Guard.

       4             One of the most important objectives of the

       5      heritage area is to increase public access, yet

       6      instead, the Coast Guard is seeking to increase

       7      private usage.

       8             Further, Congress has also designated the

       9      Hudson River as a National Heritage river.  It is

      10      one of only 14 National Heritage rivers in the

      11      entire country.  The proposed rule again would seem

      12      incompatible with the allowed usage and regulations

      13      surrounding that area of federal law.

      14             Locally there was no direct notification of

      15      the proposed rule made to the City of Yonkers, nor

      16      any of the affected communities along the length of

      17      the Hudson River as required by the federal Coastal

      18      Zone Management requirements.  The Coast Guard knew

      19      or should have known about federal Coastal

      20      Management Zone consistency and consistency with

      21      National Heritage Area and Natural Heritage River

      22      laws and rules.

      23             The proposed rules in direct conflict with 50

      24      years of significant effort to clean up the Hudson

      25      River estuary and to restore its natural habitats by







                                                                   15
       1      all levels of local government and numerous regional

       2      and community-based organizations.

       3             The said proposal would create navigational,

       4      health, environmental, homeland security, economic

       5      and quality of life problems for the City of Yonkers

       6      and should be rejected.  This section of the river

       7      is an urban river not an industrial river.

       8             Now, relative to navigation, these anchorage

       9      sites pose a navigational hazard to recreational and

      10      commercial boaters who will be forced to navigate

      11      around anchorages creating the risk of collision.

      12      I'm not a scientist, and I'm sure we'll hear from

      13      scientific experts tonight, but throughout the

      14      public comment period, I've learned that our fishery

      15      and wildlife habitat scientific research has

      16      demonstrated in other cases that habitats of some

      17      fish have been adversely affected by previous

      18      anchorage sites.

      19             The pile moorings used to create long-term

      20      anchorages also pose an environmental risk by

      21      disturbing sediment along the riverbed and natural

      22      habitat of two Hudson River endangered species, the

      23      short nose and stake sturgeon.

      24             Regarding environmental risks, there is a

      25      question of what the barges are transporting.







                                                                   16
       1      Vessels containing volatile crude oil and petroleum

       2      products pose a serious health risk whereby an

       3      anchor boat containing these hazardous materials

       4      could catch fire or spill toxic oil in the river.

       5             Regarding Homeland Security, owing to the

       6      location in the largest metropolitan area in the

       7      United States, these anchorages would present an

       8      opportune target for terrorists, and the proposal

       9      provides no additional mechanism for funding or

      10      policing our waterfront.

      11             Finally, in regard to light and noise

      12      pollution, the proposed anchorages would take a toll

      13      on the scenic beauty of our city and our waterfront

      14      revitalization and tourism.

      15             Many residents in Yonkers are concerned about

      16      the impact, constant noise, as well as the light and

      17      smoke from anchored barges, and many of the proposed

      18      sites of nearby homes and local businesses.

      19             The new expanded Yonkers anchorage ground

      20      would accommodate up to 16 vessels for long-term use

      21      stretching all the way up to the Hudson River from

      22      the downtown Yonkers train station and up into

      23      Hastings.

      24             In Yonkers, we have begun an advocacy

      25      campaign opposing this proposal.  The Yonkers City







                                                                   17
       1      Council unanimously passed a resolution opposing the

       2      rule in September, and we have joined all of our

       3      neighboring communities in what we are calling the

       4      Hudson River Waterfront Alliance.  It is a group of

       5      elected leaders from Westchester riverfront towns

       6      and villages, and Yonkers is galvanizing their

       7      efforts collectively and locally to prevent

       8      additional anchorages from lining the shores of the

       9      Hudson River.

      10             We have launched our own petition where the

      11      public can register their opposition to the proposal

      12      which will be delivered to the Coast Guard and which

      13      can be found at www.yonkersny.gov/ban/thebarges.

      14             Yonkers is experiencing a revival, a true

      15      Renaissance.  We have already over one billion

      16      dollars of economic development going on in our

      17      city, and that's in addition to the vast sums of

      18      money that have already been spent cleaning up and

      19      restoring our Hudson River.

      20             The shores of the Hudson should be a place

      21      where the our residents and visitors can gather to

      22      live, work and play.  Industry says that this

      23      dramatic expansion is necessary for safety, but it's

      24      really about their desire to expand their industrial

      25      use of the river, especially for crude oil







                                                                   18
       1      transport.  Thank you.

       2             In other major spills in the United States,

       3      it has been proven crude oil cannot be cleaned up or

       4      recovered.  The environmental consequences are

       5      simply too dire to be ignored.  This river belongs

       6      to all of us.  It is not a parking lot and is not

       7      something the City of Yonkers will support.

       8             I'm happy to answer any questions that you

       9      may have, and I truly appreciate your time tonight.

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  First of all,

      11      Mr. President, thank you for being here, coming up

      12      from Yonkers.  I have been down in Yonkers, and the

      13      revitalization of the waterfront is tremendous what

      14      you are doing down there.

      15             Have you heard from the residents down there

      16      of -- are they afraid of this coming?  And the

      17      second question I have, were you ever officially

      18      notified about any of this?

      19             LIAM McLAUGHLIN:  No.  I will answer your

      20      second question first.  We have never been

      21      officially notified by the Coast Guard, and that was

      22      something we really took offense to.

      23             SENATOR MURPHY:  Correct.

      24             LIAM McLAUGHLIN:  With waterfront efforts in

      25      the works for going on 20 years now, it is really







                                                                   19
       1      unbelievable that they wouldn't take the time to

       2      notify all the communities that would be affected.

       3             As to the residents, particularly of that

       4      section of town, they're completely beside

       5      themselves.  They've been drawn to that community

       6      because of the view, because of the vistas, our

       7      beautiful palisades.  It is truly something that is

       8      unmatched, and the thought of having barges parked

       9      along long the entirety of our waterfront is

      10      something that they just simply cannot believe.

      11             SENATOR MURPHY:  Senator Carlucci, anything?

      12             Thank you for coming up here out of your way

      13      to come up here tonight on this incredibly important

      14      issue.

      15             LIAM McLAUGHLIN:  Thank you.

      16             [ Applause ]

      17             MATT SLATER:  Before we bring up our next

      18      speaker, I just want to acknowledge some of the

      19      elected officials that are in the room today.  You

      20      are going to be hearing from quite a few of them,

      21      but just real quickly, we have County Legislator

      22      John Testa.  John, thank you very much for being

      23      here today.  Peekskill Mayor Pete Catalina.  I know

      24      we already mentioned Assemblywoman Sandy Galef is

      25      here joining us.  And we have Croton trustees







                                                                   20
       1      Ann Gallelli and Bob Anderson.  I'm not sure where

       2      Bob is.  Bob is in the back.

       3             Next up, we are going to invite Jason Baker,

       4      Senior Assistant to the Mayor's Office of Yonkers,

       5      Mayor Michael Spano.  Jason?

       6             JASON BAKER:  Thank you, Senator Murphy,

       7      Senator Serino, Senator Carlucci, and thanks to

       8      everybody who has come out tonight for being here to

       9      talk about this important issue.

      10             Thank you also Council President Liam

      11      McLaughlin for your outstanding partnership in

      12      this important issue as well.

      13             Thanks for providing me the opportunity to

      14      testify on behalf of Mayor Spano on the important

      15      issue impacting the entire Hudson region.

      16             The anchorage expansion proposal put forth on

      17      behalf of the barge industry was done so without any

      18      prior notification nor any discussion with the City

      19      of Yonkers, the fourth largest city State of

      20      New York, nor other municipalities likely to be most

      21      impacted by this plan that seems to move our

      22      region's most prized natural resource on a pathway

      23      toward reindustrialization.  That's why it's

      24      critical we make sure our concerns are heard through

      25      hearings like this, and that we also take the







                                                                   21
       1      necessary actions to organize and educate ourselves

       2      on what this proposal could mean for our

       3      communities, what it could mean for our environment,

       4      the justification for choosing the areas proposed

       5      for additional anchorage sites and what is driving

       6      the need to line our fragile river with barges.

       7             Since learning of this proposal which

       8      includes the most amount of anchorages along the

       9      shores of the City of Yonkers, Mayor Mike Spano has

      10      organized the Hudson River Waterfront Alliance known

      11      as HRWA as Council President McLaughlin spoke to.

      12      It's a bipartisan coalition of local government

      13      leaders and advocacy organizations throughout

      14      Westchester County and beyond to unite in opposition

      15      to proposed anchorage expansion.

      16             In an effort to better assist and better

      17      understand the process for rule making, facts and

      18      impacts with the anchorages and appeal the rights

      19      and actions our community may take, mayor Spano has

      20      obtained special council and experts in policy and

      21      procedure in relation to the issues presented by

      22      this proposal.

      23             So tonight I would like to share with you

      24      what we know at this point, what we may not know

      25      yet, and the actions that HRWA is taking to protect







                                                                   22
       1      our communities in the Hudson River.

       2             As mentioned already, the proposed anchorage

       3      expansion includes up to 16, possibly more new

       4      anchorage and barge sites on the Hudson from Yonkers

       5      to Kingston with the Yonkers extension encompassing

       6      approximately 715 acres for up to 16 vessels with a

       7      swing radius of 1200 feet per vessel.

       8             This extension alone could result in

       9      continuous barge parking and traffic from the

      10      Yonkers' southern border to Dobbs Ferry.

      11             The Montrose Point site would cover

      12      approximately 127 for up to three vessels with a

      13      swing radius approximately 1400 feet per vessel.  So

      14      why here?  Why are these anchorages sites necessary

      15      now.  Barge industry has cited water safety but they

      16      have safe harbor options under maritime regulations.

      17             If safety is a primary issue, why is it only

      18      an issue now?  What is not being acknowledged by the

      19      barge industry advocates is the link to the recently

      20      lifted export ban on crude oil, nor is there

      21      acknowledgment of increased crude oil transport in

      22      the Hudson from terminals at the port of Albany.

      23             Today it is estimated there is some 1500

      24      annual one-way trips of vessels carrying crude oil

      25      on the Hudson, up 400 at the time the DEC permitted







                                                                   23
       1      the handling of crude oil at the global partners

       2      terminal.

       3             The Hudson is becoming a major transportation

       4      route for crude oil, and it's crude transport that

       5      we feel is likely fueling the need for additional

       6      anchorages.  What is the impact?  Billions of

       7      dollars in economic development have been invested

       8      in waterfront communities like Yonkers along the

       9      river.  There is little question that continuous

      10      barge traffic from Yonkers to Dobbs Ferry would

      11      alter the picturesque Hudson River and Palisades

      12      views from the waterfront.

      13             While our experts are continuing to explore

      14      the levels of noise and light pollution from the

      15      barges that would result from the approval of this

      16      proposal, you only have to visit Yonkers waterfront

      17      in the evening when the barge is anchored along its

      18      shores to see firsthand the amount of light emitted

      19      from just one barge.  In fact, I've seen it

      20      personally firsthand.  I've taken pictures, and we

      21      are going to document what it looks like because

      22      there are still some questions as to exactly what it

      23      might look like with a line of barges along the

      24      river.

      25             There is great concern about the threat to







                                                                   24
       1      marinas and recreational boating as well as the

       2      impact of future development and property owners.

       3      Even more critical is the impact this proposal could

       4      have on the health and efforts to protect the Hudson

       5      River.  A 1.7 billion-dollar cleanup recently

       6      completed by G.E. and millions of additional dollars

       7      have been invested in restoring the health of the

       8      Hudson.

       9             Some of the vessels traveling the river carry

      10      as much as 12 million gallons of crude oil.  That's

      11      as much as the Exxon Valdez.  In fact only a few

      12      years ago a vessel of this size ran aground near the

      13      port of Albany.  Fortunately there was no leak but

      14      the possibility of a spill of this magnitude on the

      15      shallow Hudson waters is frightening and could

      16      potentially devastate the river.  Anchoring aside,

      17      this issue alone should warrant extensive review and

      18      consideration.

      19             Finally, there needs to be consideration of

      20      the placement of these anchorage sites and any

      21      impacts on human safety on shore.  The sites

      22      selected under this proposal include the largest

      23      city in Westchester and the fourth largest city in

      24      the state where 200,000 people reside, as well as a

      25      site just outside of the nuclear power plant.







                                                                   25
       1             Now common sense would suggest placing

       2      millions of gallons of crude oil just outside of

       3      these locations could pose unthinkable safety

       4      concerns.  And while advocates of this proposal

       5      might suggest the unlikeliness of any threat to

       6      civilian safety, history in New York alone would

       7      suggest the unthinkable tragedies do happen, and we

       8      should not be exposing ourselves to unnecessary

       9      risks.

      10             The question of how these barges and how our

      11      communities would be protected must be answered.

      12             So what have we done and what can we do?

      13      Since organizing in August, Mayor Spano and the

      14      Hudson River Waterfront Alliance have partnered with

      15      organizations included Riverkeeper, historic Hudson

      16      river towns, Hudson Valley Gateway Chamber of

      17      Commerce and recreation boating advocates.  Launched

      18      a petition that has about 1500 signatures and

      19      launched advocacy campaigns requesting the Coast

      20      Guard extend the public comment period that was

      21      recently approved and extended 90 days to December

      22      6.  They've provided web and social media resources

      23      to each community to help in their own local

      24      advocacy efforts.  HRWA will convene and we invite

      25      everybody to join the effort, sign the petition that







                                                                   26
       1      can be found and please submit your comments, your

       2      public comments to the Coast Guard before the end of

       3      the public comment period.  Again that's December 6.

       4             If you look around tonight, you will see the

       5      entire region united in opposition to this proposal,

       6      Democrats and Republicans, from Yonkers to Kingston,

       7      we stand united to protect our river and our

       8      communities.  Thank you.

       9             [ Applause ]

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  Jason, thank you very much

      11      for coming up here and testifying and tell the mayor

      12      thank you very much for his support on this.  I know

      13      this has been pushed out in one and one of the big

      14      reasons we are having this, when we reached out to

      15      the Coast Guard, our answer was we'll have our

      16      public hearing in the spring.  Meanwhile public

      17      hearing comment is going to close in December.  So

      18      this was important to get this done tonight, so I

      19      thank you guys for being part of, like you said, a

      20      bipartisan issue to do the right thing for our

      21      communities.  Tell the mayor thank you very much.

      22             JASON BAKER:  Will do.  Thank you very much

      23      for having us.

      24             MATT SLATER:  Next I'd like to invite

      25      Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi.







                                                                   27
       1             SENATOR MURPHY:  Madam supervisor, welcome.

       2             LINDA PUGLISI:  Senator, thank you.

       3             Senators, thank you very much for hosting

       4      this hearing and this forum and to the Village of

       5      Croton-on-Hudson for allowing us to use their

       6      village hall as well.

       7             I am so delighted to see so many people here

       8      today as I know you are, also.  We've been joining

       9      you at some of the press conferences, and we were

      10      down in Yonkers about a month ago with the mayor and

      11      members of his administration to form a coalition to

      12      fight this.

      13             It seems like we are always fighting

      14      something, right?  The gas line, you know, this.  We

      15      are always fighting something.  And I just want to

      16      echo what has been said before is that we in

      17      Cortlandt have not received any official

      18      notification from the Coast Guard.

      19             Now, if any of us elected officials were

      20      considering a proposal or we were going to pass a

      21      local law or state law, we would send out

      22      notification, correct?  They have not.  They didn't

      23      ask any of us for our input, and that, in itself, is

      24      outrageous in my opinion.

      25             As has been said, I want to reiterate it, the







                                                                   28
       1      Hudson River was designated an American Heritage

       2      River over a decade ago, and decades and decades of

       3      work by environmental groups and communities have

       4      gone into cleaning up the Hudson River.

       5             We can't go backwards.  It cannot become a

       6      parking lot.  We don't even know is how long these

       7      barges would be allowed to anchor at these

       8      anchorages.  That's a question to be asked of the

       9      Coast Guard.

      10             Can you imagine, they could be there for a

      11      long period of time.  The pollution would be

      12      amazing.

      13             So for environmental reasons, economic,

      14      security reasons, my colleagues on the town board

      15      and I passed a resolution adamantly opposing this

      16      United States Coast Guard anchor project, and we

      17      will continue to fight it with all of you.

      18             It's just a wonderful, bipartisan

      19      non-partisan coalition, and I know we will prevail.

      20             The Town of Cortlandt adopted a targeted

      21      local waterfront revitalization Verplank waterfront

      22      area of Cortlandt in our master plan.  The proposed

      23      anchors would not be consistent with this town's

      24      vision or its adopted goals and policies for the

      25      waterfront since the proposed anchors would be







                                                                   29
       1      located directly within the viewshed of the

       2      Cortlandt waterfront park and the segments of the

       3      historic Washington Rochambeau National Park Trail

       4      that was designated by the National Parks Department

       5      as you probably know.

       6             The proposed anchorage off Montrose Point in

       7      Cortlandt would affect views down the Hudson River

       8      from the Westchester County from the Oscawana Island

       9      Park and George's Park where you held a press

      10      conference, Senator.

      11             These waterfront parks are regional resources

      12      that offer picturesque views of the historic Hudson

      13      River and contain tidal wetlands, wooded trails and

      14      boat access to the Hudson River as well as nature

      15      study and family gatherings.

      16             Since the proposed anchors are located

      17      directly offshore of Cortlandt's waterfront parks,

      18      the recreational, environmental and cultural values

      19      of these parks would be a negative impact.

      20             In addition, the long-term anchoring of

      21      vessels carrying crude oil and other hazardous

      22      materials directly offshore of our community poses a

      23      significant safety and environmental risk to the

      24      community since the spill of crude oil or other

      25      hazardous materials into the river could devastate







                                                                   30
       1      the ecosystem, put people's health at risk and harm

       2      the regional economy.

       3             In summary, the town is requesting that a

       4      full environmental review be undertaken of the

       5      proposed anchors and compliance with NEPA.  The

       6      review must consider and respond to all the issues

       7      and questions raised by all of us as part of the

       8      public process, and that the U.S. Coast Guard hold

       9      public meetings in our community.

      10             We oppose this ill-conceived proposal.  We

      11      submitted our request to have the Coast Guard hold

      12      meetings in our area immediately once we found out

      13      about this proposal in the local newspapers.

      14             Thank you all so much.

      15             SENATOR MURPHY:  Madam supervisor, thank you.

      16      I don't have any questions for you because we have

      17      talked numerous times about this already, but thank

      18      you for coming here tonight.

      19             Senator Carlucci?

      20             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Thank you for testifying,

      21      and something that you raised, the question of how

      22      long a length of stay would a barge stay, and that's

      23      a question that we have been trying to find the

      24      answer to.  And as far as I know, really the only

      25      thing dictating that is the free market, right?







                                                                   31
       1      That if someone decides to park their cargo there,

       2      they can do that, and that's the uncomfortableness

       3      that we have that.

       4             Okay, maybe commerce will dictate that nobody

       5      wants to park their cargo there, but what happens

       6      when they do?

       7             LINDA PUGLISI:  We are all for commerce.  We

       8      just don't want a parking lot in our beautiful

       9      majestic Hudson River.

      10             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Right.  And what are the

      11      tools we have when a barge is parked out there

      12      staying there an absurd amount of time.

      13             LINDA PUGLISI:  We need help.

      14             Thank you all so very much.

      15             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, Madam Supervisor.

      16             [ Applause ]

      17             MATT SLATER:  Next I'd like to invite

      18      Eoin Wrafter.  Eoin, if would you like to come up.

      19             Eoin is representing Dutchess County

      20      Executive Marcus Molinaro, and Eoin is the

      21      Commissioner of Planning and Development of Dutchess

      22      County.

      23             EOIN WRAFTER:  Good evening, Senators Murphy,

      24      Serino, Carlucci.  Thank you for the opportunity to

      25      comment on the proposed rule establishing 10 new







                                                                   32
       1      anchors along the Hudson River between Yonkers and

       2      Kingston.

       3             My name is Eoin Wrafter.  I'm the

       4      Commissioner of Planning and Development for

       5      Dutchess County.  I'm offering this testimony on

       6      behalf of County Executive Marcus Molinaro who

       7      unfortunately could not be here this evening due to

       8      a prior conflict.

       9             The Hudson River with its beautiful

      10      waterfronts, irreplaceable ecosystems and rich

      11      history is a tremendous asset to Dutchess County,

      12      and part of what makes us distinctly Dutchess.

      13             Seven of the proposed anchorages are in close

      14      proximity to Dutchess County, borders or within our

      15      borders.  Hudson River is an irreplaceable part of

      16      our community.

      17             The current proposal lacks sufficient detail

      18      necessary to make a fully informed decision.  The

      19      proposal formalizes existing anchorage locations;

      20      however, it does not detail the types of ships that

      21      will use them, the cargo they will hold, the

      22      duration they will stay, or the frequency with which

      23      they will be used.  All of these could and should be

      24      studied further to identify their impacts on the

      25      surrounding adjacent communities.







                                                                   33
       1             We join Scenic Hudson and others in

       2      expressing concerns regarding the potential

       3      environmental and community impacts of this proposed

       4      project, including the potential use of the proposed

       5      anchorage areas by vessels carrying crude oil or

       6      refined petroleum products.

       7             These are concerns that must be mitigated,

       8      particularly the concern about the potential for an

       9      oil spill or exposure to pollutants.

      10             The Hudson River is home to many precious

      11      species, and it must be demonstrated their aquatic

      12      habitats will be protected.

      13             The Hudson River is also utilized for tourism

      14      and recreation throughout the Hudson Valley region.

      15      The increased number of commercial vessels could

      16      have a negative effect on the natural beauty of

      17      these areas and potentially change the viewshed of

      18      these iconic settings.  Communities like Beacon,

      19      Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck have made significant

      20      investments in their waterfronts to bring people and

      21      development back to the river, so it is critical

      22      that these communities and the public in general

      23      understand how these anchorages may or may not

      24      impact them.

      25             We recognize that the Hudson River is a







                                                                   34
       1      significant economic engine, and the vessels

       2      traveling along it must be able to do so safely.  We

       3      encourage efforts to improve transportation safety;

       4      however, the process to approve these anchorages has

       5      been disappointing at best.

       6             The Coast Guard must take the time to better

       7      explain this proposal, provide education answer the

       8      questions and address concerns.

       9             Clearly little has been done to engage in the

      10      necessary process of including stakeholders and the

      11      public at large, and this must be corrected.

      12             The extended comment period and public

      13      opportunities for comments is an important step as

      14      the Coast Guard considers its final decision.  It is

      15      vital that these concerns are addressed and

      16      responded to as part of an open and transparent

      17      process.  Respectfully Marcus J. Molinaro, Dutchess

      18      County Executive.

      19             Thank you.

      20             SENATOR SERINO:  Thank you, and actually,

      21      Eoin lives in my district, Dutchess County, and we

      22      have the beautiful walkway over the Hudson.  Can you

      23      imagine if we had increased traffic?

      24             We just hosted some officials from China

      25      today, and they loved the walk way over the Hudson.

       1      And we have hundreds of thousands of people that

       2      come to see that as well as our many historic sites,

       3      Vanderbilt Mansion, FDR home, Mills Mansion along

       4      the river.

       5             Thank you very much for coming tonight to

       6      represent our county executive.

       7             EOIN WRAFTER:  My pleasure.

       8             SENATOR MURPHY:  Please send regards to the

       9      county executive.  He was at a few of our press

      10      conferences, and tell him thank you for the support.

      11             EOIN WRAFTER:  He regretted he couldn't come

      12      in person.

      13             SENATOR MURPHY:  I get it.  Thank you for

      14      coming here.

      15             MATT SLATER:  Next I would like to invite Jim

      16      Monaghan who is the Supervisor of Stony Point.

      17             SUPERVISOR MONAGHAN:  Good evening.  Senator

      18      Murphy, Senator Serino and Senator Carlucci.  I

      19      commend you and thank you for holding these very

      20      important hearings.

      21             And just for the people to know, Stony Point

      22      is across the river.  It's an historic river town,

      23      it's home to the oldest lighthouse on the river.

      24      It's home to the historic Stony Point Battlefield.

      25             The Town of Stony Point unanimously passed a







                                                                   36
       1      resolution opposing the establishments of the

       2      anchorage grounds in the Hudson River.

       3             Haverstraw Bay and the vicinity stretching

       4      from the Tappan Zee Bridge to the Bear Mountain

       5      Bridge is the most active and congested recreational

       6      boating area on the Hudson with more than 35 yacht

       7      clubs, boat clubs, marinas, public boat ramps,

       8      serving at least 4,000 boats; the north end holding

       9      almost 200 of those slips within a mile of the

      10      proposed anchorage site.

      11             Stony Point Bay Channel runs through very

      12      shallow waters serving several marinas and boat

      13      clubs.  In Stony Point, there is a very busy marine

      14      fuel station that serves the high-speed ferries,

      15      police and fire boats.  There is an active junior

      16      sailing camp at the Minisceongo Yacht Club in Stony

      17      Point and an adult sailing school out of the

      18      Haverstraw Marina.

      19             The Hudson River Yacht Racing Association

      20      sponsors regular races and regattas.  The immediate

      21      area surrounding the proposed Montrose site has

      22      recreational traffic perpendicular to the barge

      23      channel branching in all directions.

      24             The underway barges would now be constricted

      25      in their maneuverability due to the proposed







                                                                   37
       1      anchorage.

       2             The river narrows between Stony Point and

       3      Verplank Point to the north and Croton Point to the

       4      south and is used more like a tidal lake.

       5             If there is an oil spill in this particular

       6      location, it will definitely spread into the tidal

       7      wetlands running from Stony Point Bay behind the

       8      Grassy Point along the Minisceongo Creek, and Cedar

       9      Pond Brook to Haverstraw Cove and Bow Line Point on

      10      the west.  It would also threaten wetlands in

      11      George's Park to the east, Lent Cove to Annesville,

      12      Peekskill Bay and Iona Island area to the north and

      13      Croton River wetlands to the south.

      14             In fact, these areas are essential to many

      15      fish, bird and other wildlife species.

      16             Our river towns up and down the Hudson River

      17      are finally able to develop their waterfront with

      18      recreational parks and activities that draw tourists

      19      to the beautiful Hudson Valley.  We must inspire to

      20      keep the rivers clean and beautiful for all our

      21      members of the community.

      22             The Town, we also submitted questions that we

      23      are looking to be answered to the Coast Guard.

      24             And once again I just want to thank you and

      25      commend you.







                                                                   38
       1             SENATOR MURPHY:  I can't thank you enough for

       2      coming across the new Tappan Zee and being with us

       3      here tonight and shedding some light on it.

       4             Senator Carlucci?

       5             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Thank you for being here

       6      tonight, and for bringing up the point about the

       7      recoverability that's something that has been a

       8      pressing issue.  We saw I believe it was a few years

       9      ago in the Mississippi River a bad spill, and a

      10      small percentage of the oil that spilled out was

      11      recoverable.

      12             We don't know what will be in the barges but

      13      if it's bakken crude, we know the recoverability

      14      rate is so minimal, so to bring that up and the

      15      important wetlands we have along both sides of the

      16      Hudson is an important point to raise, and I

      17      appreciate you for doing that.

      18             Thank you for being here.

      19             MATT SLATER:  Next I would like to invite

      20      Deborah Milone, Executive Director of the Hudson

      21      Valley Gateway Chamber of Commerce.

      22             DEBORAH MILONE:  Thank you, Senators, for

      23      asking me to be here tonight, and thank you very

      24      much for including the business community into this

      25      public hearing.







                                                                   39
       1             I just want to say that our chamber covers a

       2      small region.  Where we serve Croton-on-Hudson, the

       3      Town of Cortlandt, towns, hamlets and villages, the

       4      City of Peekskill and the Town of Putnam Valley.

       5             I'm going to read a statement that I provided

       6      to your office Senator Murphy.

       7             The Hudson Valley Chamber of Commerce

       8      adamantly opposes the proposed Hudson River

       9      commercial anchorages from Yonkers to Kingston.

      10      Beside the obvious environmental and safety

      11      concerns, the barges would be a visual pollutant to

      12      our historic river at a time when we are positioning

      13      ourselves as a tourist destination.

      14             The river is an important economic generator

      15      for local businesses in the Hudson Valley.

      16      Communities with river access and vistas promote the

      17      waterfront as a place to take in the breathtaking

      18      panoramic views of the majestic waterway.  The river

      19      also serves as recreational resource for residents

      20      and visitors alike which fuels the local boating and

      21      watersports industries.

      22             The Hudson is the centerpiece of our tourism

      23      efforts and attracts people from all over the world.

      24             Now we are also a tourism information center,

      25      and we weekly receive visitors every week coming in







                                                                   40
       1      using -- looking for things to do along the river.

       2             The City of Peekskill, I guess, Frank, how

       3      many months ago opened up the Riverwalk?

       4             UNIDENTIFIED VOICE:  One year ago.

       5             DEBORAH MILONE:  And people coming in, it's

       6      drawing more and more tourists and visitors from

       7      outside of our local communities to come and walk

       8      this beautiful river.

       9             The tourist dollars benefit our hospitality,

      10      food and beverage industries, as well as other

      11      businesses that rely on visitors to survive.  Here

      12      tonight is Lou Lanzer (ph) along with Diamond

      13      Brothers.  They're redeveloping the Old Cove

      14      property previously known as Crystal Bay and will be

      15      reopening and renovating the Charles Point Marina.

      16             SENATOR MURPHY:  Awesome.

      17             DEBORAH MILONE:  In 2012, visitors spent

      18      $4.75 billion in the Hudson River Valley creating

      19      over 81,000 direct jobs and generating 318 million

      20      in local taxes benefiting small towns as well as

      21      larger cities.

      22             The Hudson Valley is ranked number two by

      23      Lonely Planet in its top 10 travel destinations

      24      worldwide.  I can attest to that.  I get calls from

      25      all over the country, and because we are regional







                                                                   41
       1      chamber, I get calls from Europe and Europeans

       2      coming in because they want to visit the Hudson

       3      Valley region.

       4             Mariners have been navigating the Hudson

       5      River for 400 years without the need for anchor

       6      barges.  This ill-conceived concept by people who

       7      don't even live here is unfathomable at a time when

       8      the Hudson and its shoreline communities are making

       9      a comeback.

      10             On behalf of our nearly 500 member businesses

      11      and organizations, please consider the economic

      12      environmental safety and esthetic impact this will

      13      have on our business and residential communities.

      14             SENATOR MURPHY:  Deb, thank you so much for

      15      coming here tonight, and thank you for all the work

      16      that you do.

      17             This is part of the reason why we are having

      18      these public hearings is to figure out, there is a

      19      security issue, there is an environmental issue

      20      here.  There is also an economic issue here, and

      21      this is the stuff that people are investing hundreds

      22      of millions of dollars on this waterfront, and they

      23      could be gone tomorrow.  Thank you.

      24             DEBORAH MILONE:  You are welcome.  I just

      25      want to add our chamber and the business council of







                                                                   42
       1      Westchester have come out to oppose this, and I hope

       2      other Chambers of Commerce along the Hudson River

       3      will come out and do the same.

       4             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you for being here

       5      tonight, Deb.  Thank you.

       6             [ Applause ]

       7             MATT SLATER:  I would like to invite

       8      Westchester County Executive Robert Astorino to come

       9      testify.

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, County Executive.

      11      You are under oath.

      12             COUNTY EXECUTIVE ROBERT ASTORINO:  Senator,

      13      thank you very much for hosting this.  Senator

      14      Serino, good to have you here.  Senator Carlucci and

      15      Senator Murphy, thank you very much.  We appreciate

      16      this, you taking the lead on what is a very

      17      important issue and one that wouldn't have got the

      18      light of day if the three of you and others didn't

      19      start talking about this because, like a lot of

      20      things the federal government does in all of their

      21      overreach, they tend to do things quietly and in the

      22      dark so nobody understands what is really going on.

      23             But this is a really important issue for --

      24      and you just touched upon it:  Environmental issues,

      25      for Westchester tourism issues, and public safety.







                                                                   43
       1      You know, that is a very big issue post-9/11.

       2             I am dumbfounded.  There are 2,800,000

       3      federal employees, and they couldn't accepted one to

       4      Croton tonight to represent their point of view.

       5             [ Applause ]

       6             So a couple things I just wanted to touch

       7      upon.  You know, the beauty of itself of George's

       8      Island or Croton Point Park or in Yonkers where

       9      they're redeveloping the waterfront, these proposals

      10      are one that would create, in my estimation -- you

      11      know, I'll start with national security issues.

      12             You know, we have soft and hard targets in

      13      Westchester.  One is pretty close to here, and

      14      that's Indian Point, but we also have bridges and

      15      tunnels and malls and many other areas that are

      16      considered to be targets.  And we drill for that,

      17      and we understand what to do if we had to do

      18      something.  But the thought of having barges moored

      19      along the Hudson River and the responsibility of now

      20      having new targets, soft targets, would create an

      21      additional layer of National Security and issues

      22      that we would have to deal with locally, and the

      23      response to that would be very difficult at best.

      24      You know, the proposal that is for Montrose and I

      25      know the supervisor is here, and I'm sure she will







                                                                   44
       1      talk and she has talked about this as well,

       2      supervisor and I both understand as do you that if

       3      you had these barges and that would be about 127

       4      acres would be the area that they could moor as well

       5      as halfway across the Hudson River, you think about

       6      that just visually how big that would be.

       7             Forget the visual blight, but as I said, the

       8      security issues are very, very grave or potentially

       9      as well as the environmental issues that come into

      10      effect here, too.  So I know Yonkers and I think

      11      representative was here, Mr. McLaughlin.

      12             So the one problem is when you look at the

      13      definition under the Federal Register of what

      14      they're trying to do, it's pretty disconcerting

      15      because they list this as long-term.  There is no

      16      definition other than long-term being longer than 30

      17      days.  So it could be anywhere from 30 days to in

      18      perpetuity, and that's not just stopping by.  That's

      19      moving in.

      20             And so we have a big problem with the size

      21      and scope of this, and that is federal government

      22      vagueness at its worst.  You cannot pin them down

      23      for what this actually would be.  So I wanted to

      24      come here tonight.  We've outlined this in letters

      25      to the Coast Guard.  We in our press conferences







                                                                   45
       1      have talked about this, and I'm glad and really

       2      happy there is a full house here tonight because

       3      this is an important issue that stretches from

       4      Yonkers all the way up past our borders up through,

       5      you know, through Orange County and above, but that

       6      really will affect two parts of our county and

       7      everybody in between.

       8             So I want to thank the three of you for

       9      taking the lead on this.  To the Coast Guard and to

      10      the federal government, shame on you for not being

      11      here and defending your position.  And though this

      12      might not technically be a public hearing to the

      13      federal government, the public is very much a part

      14      of this process whether they like it or not.  And so

      15      thank you for putting the lights on in here, and

      16      they will hear from us not just from tonight but as

      17      we continue to go forward.  So thank you.

      18             SENATOR MURPHY:  Listen, thank you so much

      19      for coming out of your busy schedule, being here

      20      tonight, and I know we've had a few press

      21      conferences together just to kind of pound the drum

      22      and make sure that people are aware of this.

      23             The reality is that this was going underneath

      24      the table.  This was flying low.  I don't think they

      25      wanted anything to do with us knowing anything about







                                                                   46
       1      it.  And I'm going to ask, were you ever officially

       2      notified by the Coast Guard that they were

       3      interested in doing this along our majestic Hudson

       4      River?

       5             Madam supervisor back there, the lady who

       6      runs the town here, found out in the newspaper,

       7      disgraceful.  Absolutely disgraceful.          .

       8             COUNTY EXECUTIVE ROBERT ASTORINO:  Like many

       9      things the federal government does, and we have been

      10      dealing with Housing and Urban Development, a

      11      different agency, but it's very similar in the

      12      treatment that the federal government gives to state

      13      and local governments.

      14             And in this country, the system of government

      15      we have is a balance, supposed to be a balance

      16      between the federal government and state and local.

      17      But the federal government runs roughshod over that

      18      all the time unless and until the citizens actually

      19      speak up and fight back.  And so this is a perfect

      20      example of the big bad federal government actually

      21      being barked at and going to be bitten by the people

      22      who are affected by this.  So thank you.

      23             SENATOR MURPHY:  The nice part about it is

      24      that the we did pound the drum and they extended the

      25      public comment.







                                                                   47
       1             COUNTY EXECUTIVE ROBERT ASTORINO:  Yes, and

       2      that's important.  I think people need to get on the

       3      record on something like this because if we don't,

       4      they're going say that this may not be a public

       5      hearing official, et cetera.  It is really important

       6      that this go to them as part of the public record

       7      and that people, not just the elected officials, but

       8      average citizens affected by this write a letter and

       9      get in the public record.

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  This is officially being

      11      videotaped by the New York State Senate, and they

      12      will be delivered a copy, I promise you.

      13             COUNTY EXECUTIVE ROBERT ASTORINO:  Great, let

      14      me point right at the camera and tell you to get the

      15      barges out of here.

      16             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thanks for coming down.

      17      Appreciate it.

      18             [ Applause ]

      19             MATT SLATER:  Our next speaker for tonight is

      20      Ned Sullivan, president of Scenic Hudson.

      21             Ned.

      22             NED SULLIVAN:  Good evening.

      23             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you for being here

      24      tonight.

      25             NED SULLIVAN:  Senator Murphy, Senator







                                                                   48
       1      Carlucci, Mayor Schmidt, thank you for convening

       2      this and being out late at night on an important

       3      night in this nation's history.

       4             As everybody here has said, the Hudson River

       5      is our region's most important natural asset.  It's

       6      vital to the environment, to the public health and a

       7      powerful engine for the economy and job creations.

       8      You've heard from elected officials from

       9      Westchester, and they and the state government,

      10      federal government agencies, private organizations

      11      like Scenic Hudson and others, partners have

      12      invested hundreds of millions of dollars in

      13      revitalizing our riverfronts and creating beautiful

      14      parks and restaurants and residential developments

      15      that bring people down to the Hudson, that make it

      16      an asset that we are all very proud of.

      17             Scenic Hudson has created over 60 parks and

      18      preserves along the Hudson, here in Westchester.  We

      19      have parks in Yonkers and Irvington and Peekskill.

      20      On the other side of the river in Haverstraw and all

      21      the way up the river through the Kingston-Rhinecliff

      22      area where the northern-most anchorages are

      23      proposed.  All of these would be put at risk by this

      24      proposed rule making to park and warehouse huge

      25      barges carrying crude oil and other chemicals on the







                                                                   49
       1      river.

       2             As everybody knows, everybody is familiar

       3      with the proposal, 43 berths, 10 locations.  It's

       4      really crazy and something that we are adamantly

       5      opposed to and that we are hearing a unified chorus

       6      of opposition to.  So I commend you all for your

       7      early action on this, for creating this opportunity,

       8      and we will all be working together to defeat this.

       9             The industry sponsors of this have stated

      10      that trade will increase on the Hudson River

      11      significantly over the next few years with the

      12      lifting of the ban on American crude exports for

      13      foreign trade and federally-designated anchorages

      14      are key to supporting this trade.

      15             So this is something that we are very, very

      16      concerned about.  That they are anticipating this

      17      great increase in exports so we are going to be

      18      exploiting America's crude oil for export, and the

      19      Hudson would become the super highway for fossil

      20      fuels, endangering all the tremendous resources that

      21      we have, both natural and constructed along it.

      22             So as you've heard, the proposal would

      23      encompass 2400 acres of the Hudson, exposing it to

      24      these industrial impacts to long-term storage of

      25      barges carrying crude and other products.  We are







                                                                   50
       1      equally concerned, as the county executive just

       2      stated, about the length of time that is clearly an

       3      uncertainty, but the notion that they would be

       4      parked for 30 days or longer is unthinkable.

       5             Each of these barges and tankers could

       6      measure up to 600 feet.  They would be visible from

       7      homes along the river, bridges, local waterfronts,

       8      the national historic landmark district, as well as

       9      many popular destinations listed on the National

      10      Register of Historic Places.

      11             The capacity of these is comparable to the

      12      Exxon Valdez, the tremendous devastating spill that

      13      ravaged the waterfronts and natural resources of

      14      Alaska.

      15             One of these sites, of course, has been noted

      16      would be in close proximity to Indian Point.  What

      17      are they thinking?  What are they thinking?

      18             [ Applause ]

      19             So the proposal would jeopardize the valley's

      20      tremendous world-renowned scenery, the basis for a

      21      $4.7 billion tourism economy as we heard from the

      22      Gateway Chamber representative.

      23             The Department of State has designated scenic

      24      areas of statewide significance.  They're one of the

      25      only places in New York State that has these







                                                                   51
       1      designations because of the incredible beauty that

       2      we have.  And these serve as the foundation, a

       3      regulatory foundation for protection of the natural

       4      historic and economic resources along the coast.

       5             And these are -- New York State has delegated

       6      responsibility for protecting these coastal areas,

       7      so the New York Department of State has a very

       8      important role to play here.

       9             As we've heard, the vessels parked along the

      10      river would bring unwanted light and noise pollution

      11      that we associate with industrial facilities,

      12      especially at night when deck and navigational

      13      lights would be needed for safety.

      14             Many of these are powered by diesel

      15      generators that would be creating noise and air

      16      pollution.  This would, you know, truly threaten the

      17      incredible tourism economy that is coming up.  Just

      18      imagine sitting at one of the beautiful restaurants

      19      along the Hudson and Westchester as many of the

      20      finest and looking out on these barges and smell the

      21      exhaust.

      22             How is that going to be for Friday night or

      23      Saturday night?  I think it's going to be

      24      devastating for our tourism recreational

      25      destinations and will really just damage the quality







                                                                   52
       1      of life that we are coming to enjoy and relish, and

       2      that is such a magnet for tourists from all over the

       3      world.

       4             Our natural resources are being put at risk.

       5      Hudson is home to over 200 species of fish including

       6      the endangered Atlantic and short-nosed sturgeon.

       7      The anchorages have been proposed in the

       8      Kingston-Poughkeepsie region, known spawning grounds

       9      for these majestic and iconic species.

      10             They've also been, the anchorages have also

      11      been proposed for Haverstraw Bay, the most

      12      highly-rated significant coastal life wildlife

      13      habitat in the Hudson River and vital over wintering

      14      habitat for sturgeon.

      15             So allowing the vast storage of container

      16      ships containing millions of gallons of volatile and

      17      harmful chemicals that are causing damage and

      18      explosions and spills all over the country, add to

      19      the dangers our communities face every day from the

      20      crude oil transported by trains in poorly-designed

      21      rail cars.

      22             This is something that wasn't happening at

      23      all a few years ago, and there has been a massive

      24      increase.  And the entire region absolutely lacks

      25      the safeguards to prevent and respond to spills.







                                                                   53
       1             The legislature and the governor have taken

       2      some action over the last several years.  There have

       3      been budget allocations of a couple million dollars

       4      to plan for spill response and to coordinate with

       5      the federal agencies on the national contingency

       6      plan.  But we know they're inadequate.

       7             We know that the response, the Coast Guard

       8      response vehicles are based down in New York harbor

       9      and that it would take hours, hours for them to get

      10      to a spill upriver.

      11             We know that the Hudson is tidal, so a spill

      12      would -- the product, the contaminants would go up

      13      and down with the tide, ebbing and flowing and

      14      contaminating one waterfront after another.  We know

      15      that drinking water supplies, and there are at least

      16      half a dozen in the upper reaches of the Hudson,

      17      that are in the direct line, directly adjacent to

      18      the anchorage areas.

      19             We are talking about beach, we are talking

      20      about water supplies, wetlands, aquatic life, you

      21      know, all the way from Albany to New York Harbor

      22      because of the flow of the river and of the tides.

      23             So the proposed anchorage importantly is

      24      inconsistent with New York State's coastal

      25      management program, and there are specific policies







                                                                   54
       1      relating to aquatic habitat, to coastal development,

       2      to public access, to recreation and historic and

       3      scenic resources, to water and air resources,

       4      wetlands and others.

       5             These are highly detailed rules that have

       6      been very important in stopping other ill-conceived

       7      proposals over the years.

       8             So the Department of State plays an important

       9      role here.  I personally briefed the Secretary of

      10      State on this matter, and I would encourage you to

      11      work with her and other D.E.C. and other state

      12      agencies on this.  But the Coastal Zone Management

      13      rules are delegated to New York State, so these are

      14      federal and state rules that are brought into play

      15      here, and this is the area that we are going to be

      16      focusing on.

      17             So in summary, Scenic Hudson opposes this

      18      proposal.  We urge you to work with our U.S.

      19      Congressional and Senate representatives, the

      20      D.E.C., the Department of State and others to block

      21      this regulatory misstep.

      22             We are heartened by instruction of

      23      legislation by Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney that

      24      would prevent the permitting of these anchorages

      25      along the Hudson and urge you to support this







                                                                   55
       1      initiative to try to get a Senate Bill that would

       2      enable us to move through the Congress as rapidly as

       3      possible.

       4             And finally, it's important for everyone in

       5      the room to tell your friends about the December 6

       6      deadline, and to file your comments and to take all

       7      possible actions to protect our river and valley

       8      from this dangerous proposal.

       9             I've included with the testimony I gave you

      10      photo simulation that we've made of just four of,

      11      let's see, five of the barges parked on the

      12      Westchester waterfront.  This would be kind of the

      13      northern area of the Yonkers extension.  They're

      14      parked right in the middle of the river so I have

      15      provided them to you for your review.

      16             You can just get a sense of what a bad idea

      17      this is and why we should all fight this with

      18      everything we've got.  Thank you very much.

      19             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, Ned.

      20             [ Applause ]

      21             MATT SLATER:  Our next speaker is Edward

      22      Kelly.  Ed is the Executive Director of the Maritime

      23      Association Port of New York and New Jersey.

      24             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you, Ed.  Appreciate

      25      you coming tonight.

       1             EDWARD KELLY:  My pleasure.  Good evening,

       2      Mr. Chairman, Senator Murphy, esteemed panelists,

       3      ladies and gentlemen.

       4             My name is Edward J. Kelly, and I'm the

       5      Executive Director of the Maritime Association of

       6      the Port of New York and New Jersey.  In

       7      coordination with the Hudson River Pilots

       8      Association and the American Waterways Operators,

       9      our Tug and Barge Committee is the one who made the

      10      proposal to the U.S. Coast Guard to establish new

      11      designated anchorages on the Hudson River that

      12      proposal has been published as U.S. Coast Guard

      13      Docket 2016-0132 as an advance notice of proposed

      14      rule making pertaining to the establishment of these

      15      designated anchorages.

      16             We have submitted written testimony that will

      17      give some additional information pertaining to

      18      economic impacts, the thousands of jobs that are

      19      created literally billions of dollars of taxes paid

      20      by this industry to federal, state and municipal

      21      organizations.  But we also would like to address,

      22      we are available to anyone who would like to talk to

      23      us about these facts about what these proposals mean

      24      and to certainly clarify and hopefully dispel the

      25      many misconceptions and misstatements that have been







                                                                   57
       1      made in regards to this proposal.

       2             We have seen several published websites,

       3      et cetera, that contain erroneous information.  We

       4      stand ready to meet with anybody who would like to

       5      meet with us.  I have already met with Ulster county

       6      legislative groups, met with several people.  Our

       7      name, address, telephone number and emailing listed

       8      on the proposal, and anyone who would like to meet

       9      with us further, I have a business card and would be

      10      more than happy to arrange a mutual time, date and

      11      flies have a discussion.

      12             I started my day in Philadelphia this morning

      13      with another meeting.  I think it's important enough

      14      I made it up here tonight to attend this hearing.

      15             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you.

      16             EDWARD KELLY:  We have very firm beliefs this

      17      is good for the economy, for the region, for

      18      security.

      19             So if I could proceed just quickly.  Our

      20      operators believe that we have a tremendous

      21      dedication and responsibility for the protection of

      22      human life, of property, and the ecology of this

      23      river and the ecosystem that it contains.  We feel

      24      that these anchorages are all about safety.  These

      25      anchorages, since this guy named Hudson stumbled







                                                                   58
       1      across this river 400 years ago, this river has been

       2      used for commercial navigation, and ships have

       3      regularly anchored in many of the areas that are

       4      currently proposed to be designated formally.

       5             We are seeking formal designation because the

       6      river has become busier, and we would like to have

       7      designated, safe, supervised locations for anchorage

       8      so that people are not forced to operate in unsafe

       9      conditions.

      10             If I could just run through a couple what

      11      have we believe are some of the facts involved in

      12      this, and then specifically a few things I've heard

      13      addressed tonight regarding sturgeon, long-term

      14      anchorages, et cetera.  We would like to talk about

      15      how these anchorages will help to enhance the

      16      safety, security and environmental stewardship of

      17      the vessels and the waterways in which they operate.

      18             Anchorages are good for safety.  That's what

      19      this is all about.  A safe place to anchor is

      20      essential to the safety of the crew, the vessels,

      21      other operators, property and cargoes as well as the

      22      health of the river environment itself.  Vessels are

      23      forced to anchor for many safety reasons, including

      24      fog, weather conditions, equipment issues, ice and

      25      many other reasons.







                                                                   59
       1             Anchorages also allow vessels to wait to

       2      navigate at first light and at high tide when it is

       3      the safest potential to operate in the river.  A

       4      safe place to anchor is essential to safety.

       5             The proposed anchorage sites have been

       6      selected due to a variety of physical

       7      characteristics that facilitate safety including the

       8      depth of the water, shelter from currents, width of

       9      the river, the interval of spacing and the location

      10      of what have been usual and customary anchorage

      11      locations.

      12             These proposed anchorages are intended to

      13      simply formalize decades, if not centuries, of safe

      14      industry practice and give the U.S. Coast Guard

      15      oversight of these anchorage areas.

      16             We have heard about long-term parking lots.

      17      Anchorages are not parking lots.  Vessels are

      18      typically anchored for very limited period of time,

      19      usually between four to six hours.  They're always

      20      manned during this time and lit in accordance with

      21      U.S. Coast Guard regulations.

      22             Anchorages do not require construction or

      23      placement of infrastructure in or around the river.

      24      The long-term expression is simply a Coast Guard

      25      expression that says it's not a temporary.  In other







                                                                   60
       1      words, it's there.  It will be designated on federal

       2      charts, navigational charts, and they will be there

       3      until change.  It does not mean the vessels will

       4      stay there for long periods of time.

       5             If anyone wants to find the truth, you follow

       6      the money.  It makes absolutely no economic sense to

       7      store any type of product, especially barges, on a

       8      river location.  The cost to do so is magnitude

       9      differences compared to storing it in shoreside

      10      facilities.

      11             If you store any type of product, but a lot

      12      of people are talking about oil, and in particular

      13      oil.  Barges have to be manned.  Tugs have to be

      14      anchored to accompany them.  Those crews have to be

      15      paid, the cost of the tug has to be paid.  Barge

      16      hire has to be paid.

      17             Transportation companies only make money when

      18      their vessels and cargoes are moving.  It makes no

      19      sense to spend that kind of money to hold a product

      20      that could very easily have been held in storage

      21      facilities either downriver in the port or upriver

      22      in the various terminals and storage locations that

      23      are around the river.  It makes no economic sense.

      24             People will go out of business in a short

      25      period of time by trying to do ridiculous economic







                                                                   61
       1      things.  There is no economic advantage.

       2             Anchorages are good for the environment.  The

       3      reason we say that is because environmentally, our

       4      industry is subject to numerous environmental

       5      regulations including Oil Pollution Act which as of

       6      last year and since last year has required all

       7      barges to be double hulled.  The anchorage areas

       8      would further serve to protect the environment by

       9      allowing operators to avoid navigating during unsafe

      10      conditions that could lead to accidents and/or

      11      spills.

      12             The environmental benefit of maritime

      13      transportation is supported by the industry's track

      14      record.  The latest stat available from the U.S.

      15      Army Corps of Engineers shows there has been no oil

      16      leaked from tank barges into the Hudson since data

      17      tracking began with the Army Corps of Engineers.

      18      Water-borne transport reduces roadway congestion and

      19      emissions by reducing the need for truck transport.

      20             The New York City Economic Development Corp

      21      did a study that found that in one single year,

      22      water-borne barge transportation eliminated 3.1

      23      million truck trips within New York City alone.

      24      This is because the efficiency of maritime

      25      transportation, a typical inland barge, has the







                                                                   62
       1      capacity 15 times greater than one rail car and 60

       2      times greater than one semitrailer truck.

       3             By the way, I don't believe a 600-foot barge

       4      exists on this planet, but people keep talking about

       5      it.

       6             Anchorages are good for security.  From a

       7      security standpoint, vessels are required to comply

       8      with U.S. Coast Guard-approved security plans, and

       9      all professional Mariners are required to be U.S.

      10      citizens who are required to hold transportation

      11      worker identification credentials issued by the TSA

      12      which provide digital photo I.D. and require

      13      extensive criminal and drug background checks.

      14             Additionally U.S. Coast Guard regulations

      15      require all water-borne crew to hold proper Coast

      16      Guard licenses, ratings and training certifications.

      17      These measures are intended to strictly control

      18      access to vessels at all times including while

      19      they're at anchor.

      20             Anchorages are good for the economy.

      21      Economically commercial vessel are engaged in moving

      22      vital cargoes to communities along the Hudson.  Most

      23      of the vessels that would use these anchorage areas

      24      are vessels already engaged in moving products

      25      directly to consumers.  Refined oil products like







                                                                   63
       1      home heating oil, the gasoline that powers your car,

       2      the fuel that powers the power companies that make

       3      the electricity go on, and it also is in the best

       4      economic interest of maritime companies that vessels

       5      are engaged in transporting cargo, not waiting at

       6      anchor.

       7             Other majority of the cargoes include

       8      aggregate which comes downriver, an export commodity

       9      moves from upstate New York to the lower place for

      10      road bed construction.

      11             We heard there is a little bit of ice and

      12      snow upstate New York.  We move sand and salt

      13      upriver.  Construction materials move upriver,

      14      recyclables are moved up and down the river for more

      15      economic disposal.

      16             Designation of anchorages by the Coast Guard

      17      will neither directly increase nor decrease cargo

      18      shipments on the river.  Only the actual consumption

      19      of gasoline, heating oil, sand, construction

      20      materials, et cetera, by the region's residents will

      21      have an impact on the amount of cargo moving.

      22             Based on that, it's clear that the creation

      23      of federally-designated anchorages under U.S. Coast

      24      Guard supervision is in the interest of all the

      25      parties.  We would like to have support on this.







                                                                   64
       1      Our people have operated on this river for

       2      centuries.  We have operated safely, economically,

       3      and we have moved the goods that provide the

       4      American way of life.

       5             As long as people want to have home heating

       6      oil, as long as they want to have electricity, they

       7      need salt, sand and the other commodities these

       8      barges move, it makes sense to let them operate

       9      safely.

      10             If you were driving down the road and you

      11      were faced by a very severe fog or extremely heavy

      12      thunderstorm, what do you do?  Do you keep driving

      13      and just say I hope we don't hit anything and kill

      14      people, or do you look for a safe way to slow down

      15      and operate safely, pull off the road.

      16             What if you had ice coming down the river

      17      facing you?  You would want a safe place to pull

      18      out.  That's what this is all about.  We would be

      19      more than happy to address sturgeon.  If anybody is

      20      interested, I have a copy and I have actually read

      21      the study that was commissioned by the

      22      New York State, the Hudson River Foundation and

      23      several other people.  It's here.  I've spoken to

      24      the authors.  I'm not just listening to the buzz and

      25      misinformation.







                                                                   65
       1             This report does conclude that anchors make

       2      marks on the bottom, and it says the anchors silt

       3      over rather quickly because the river moves and the

       4      bottom shifts.

       5             They have not proven this is detrimental.  In

       6      fact, a quote from the author, and I will provide it

       7      to whoever would like it says at this point, we

       8      cannot say if there is any impact to the bottom

       9      habitat with regard to sturgeon, and we have been

      10      very careful to stay away from making these

      11      linkages.  I hear people laughing.  Here is the

      12      report with the quote from the authors.

      13             This is what they allege they're talking

      14      about.  I would like people to read this report, not

      15      just make distorted comments about it.

      16             The Coast Guard procedures, we agree, are

      17      awkward at best.  This is typical federal rule

      18      making procedures.  All legislators do have staff

      19      that monitor the federal register.  That's how you

      20      find out what these crazy feds are doing in your

      21      areas.  They do not reach out to individual people.

      22      They expect that you should reach out to them.  It's

      23      published in the Federal Register.

      24             The typical pattern on this on any federal

      25      regulation whether you are dealing with the corps or







                                                                   66
       1      any agency, there is a public comment period.

       2      Because of the pushback and information that people

       3      are seeking, the public written comment period was

       4      extended.

       5             On the conclusion of that, they will gather

       6      all of these.  At last count I think it was 3600

       7      public comments.  They will sort them, evaluate

       8      them.  Based on that they will determine, which in

       9      this case I'm sure they will, that they need to have

      10      public hearings.

      11             They will publish the public hearing

      12      information in the Federal Register.  They will not

      13      reach out to people.  They don't reach out to me

      14      anymore than they reach out to you.  There will be

      15      public hearings.  There will be a series of these

      16      probably in the spring because the Federal Register

      17      has posting periods.

      18             People will come out.  We expect to have a

      19      full discussion.  We would like to talk about facts,

      20      not misconceptions or distortions.  We don't want to

      21      see websites showing 4500 TEU container ships that

      22      physically could not fit past the George Washington

      23      bridge and never would economically.

      24             The Exxon Valdez.  I knew the captain of the

      25      Exxon Valdez.  I'm a maritime captain.  I sail these







                                                                   67
       1      ships.  Anything the size of the Exxon Valdez could

       2      never make it up the Hudson River.  There is not

       3      enough depth.  It would run aground long before it

       4      hit Yonkers.  These things require deep draft.

       5      Misconceptions, distortion of fact.

       6             I have a pocket full of business cards if

       7      anybody would like to have further discussions.  I

       8      don't want to take up too much time.  We are trying

       9      to keep it on schedule.  I've made my notes, and

      10      I've seen quite a few things.  There are no parking

      11      lots.  It makes no economic sense.  Long-term is

      12      just a definition the Coast Guard uses as opposed to

      13      like when we have the fourth of July fireworks, they

      14      establish temporary anchorages so that people can

      15      park their recreational boats and watch the

      16      fireworks.  A long-term designation means it gets

      17      put on a chart.

      18             So anyway, if anybody would like to further

      19      discuss this, we've got facts on this.  We would be

      20      more than happy to meet with anybody that would ask.

      21      I have to say that no one has asked to meet with us.

      22      Anybody that has, we meet with them.

      23             We are here tonight.  We will be any place

      24      else that anybody wants us to be to further pursue

      25      this.

       1             SENATOR MURPHY:  Ed, thank you for coming up

       2      from Philadelphia and to this incredibly important

       3      meeting for our community.

       4             EDWARD KELLY:  Certainly.

       5             SENATOR MURPHY:  This is the first

       6      information that has ever been told to me.  We have

       7      been trying to reach out.  You just explained a lot

       8      of stuff that we've all had questions about, and

       9      there is going to be a bunch more trust me.  There

      10      is going to be a bunch more.  This isn't the end of

      11      it.  You are the first representative to come up to

      12      answer some of the questions we've had.  We can't

      13      get the Coast Guard here.

      14             EDWARD KELLY:  Likely you won't get the Coast

      15      Guard here.

      16             SENATOR MURPHY:  That's disturbing.  Yet

      17      they're making the rules and regulations on our

      18      Hudson River for us to live by, for us business

      19      owners, for us constituents, for our people to live

      20      there yet they're not even coming to a meeting for

      21      us.  That's unacceptable.

      22             EDWARD KELLY:  Senator, I agree federal

      23      procedures are awkward and annoying to everybody.

      24      Ourselves included.  We deal with the Coast Guard,

      25      the Corps of Engineers and NOAA.  We will hold







                                                                   69
       1      ourselves open as an industry to anybody that would

       2      like to meet with us.  Any further hearing, if

       3      people, legislators or community groups wish us to

       4      sit down with them, that's what we do.  That's what

       5      I will do.  We will be there.

       6             SENATOR MURPHY:  I can't thank you enough for

       7      coming here and explaining some of this because

       8      we've had a heck of a lot of questions, and

       9      obviously, there are a lot more.  But being here

      10      tonight, coming out of your way, this is a very,

      11      very, very important meeting to all three of us who

      12      represent close to a million people, and that's what

      13      we do.  We represent the people.  And when the Coast

      14      Guard can't get here to answer some of the questions

      15      for a million people that we represent, that's

      16      disturbing.

      17             EDWARD KELLY:  Yep.  I agree, but on behalf

      18      of the industry that would use and need these

      19      anchorages, as I say, we are available if anybody

      20      would like to stop by.  I have a pocket full of

      21      business cards and would be more than happy to

      22      arrange a drill down, talk about any of the facts.

      23             We clearly understand communities have a very

      24      valid concerns.  We need to discuss back and forth

      25      how to make this proposal work because the reality







                                                                   70
       1      is the business is moving on the river right now

       2      today, and we want to make sure it operates safely.

       3             This is not a question of if they designate

       4      this, and again, there is nothing to build.  It's

       5      just a designation on the chart.  There is no

       6      infrastructure.  It doesn't touch the bottom.

       7      There's nothing, just a designated to drop an anchor

       8      and some of the large areas don't mean the whole

       9      area will be used.

      10             It means as we mentioned, the Hudson is

      11      tidal.  The reason we want to establish anchorages

      12      so vessel owners/operators will know where it is

      13      safe so they can swing without hitting shallow

      14      ground causing spills, etc, and very frankly, we

      15      don't want to use these anchorages if we don't have

      16      to.  We don't make money when the barges are not

      17      moving, so I don't want to take up too much time.

      18             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  I have a couple of

      19      questions.  Thank you for being here, and thank you

      20      for your passion and your profession.  I guess what

      21      I'm still unclear about, and I really appreciate you

      22      shedding some light is, what has changed?

      23             We talk about centuries of maritime passing

      24      through the Hudson River, and we talk about the

      25      extremes.  Of course, no one wants captains to be







                                                                   71
       1      sailing down the river when there is ice in the

       2      river, or there are storms.  And I guess what I'm

       3      still uncomfortable about is what has changed?  What

       4      have we done up until this point?  And why not have

       5      any standards in terms of hey, when do you dock, or

       6      when do you lower the anchor, and how long you stay

       7      there.

       8             I know you talk about economic sense, but

       9      being in the senate for six years, I've seen some

      10      things that might not make economic sense, but if we

      11      leave it solely up to the free market and to

      12      commerce to dictate what is done, it leaves us

      13      holding the bag in some circumstances.

      14             So I can point to a few examples of that, and

      15      that's just where have I some problems, so maybe you

      16      could shed a little more light on what has changed

      17      and why now.

      18             EDWARD KELLY:  What has changed is we have

      19      had situations where there is a Champlain Hudson

      20      power exchange they're looking to lay a cable down

      21      the river.  Unless there is a designated anchorage,

      22      we have no voice in saying don't put cables there.

      23      Cables could foul anchors.  We could have problems

      24      with that.  There is increased usage.

      25             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Just to expand on that.







                                                                   72
       1      The Champlain Power Express, if we have this federal

       2      designation, they cannot build...

       3             EDWARD KELLY:  They can't build through an

       4      anchorage.

       5             That anchorage would not be used, drop an

       6      anchor and pull a cable up and disrupt the power

       7      supplies.  That's one of the considerations.

       8      Another consideration is by designating this on

       9      charts, all Mariners, recreational, commercial, know

      10      that that is a safe place to anchor, and there may

      11      be vessels there.  They will be able to calculate

      12      the swing radius so they know the movement of

      13      vessels at anchor could be.

      14             And we've worked with Sandy Galef to promote

      15      legislation in New York State to increase

      16      recreational boater education and awareness.  We

      17      want these people responsible.  We want them well

      18      educated.  They need to understand charts and how

      19      this stuff works.  So there is a lot of things.

      20             What has changed?  We need these because the

      21      river has had more usage.  There are more

      22      recreational people out there.  Some businesses

      23      increased, and we need to have a spot -- you can see

      24      with the push back we are getting right now, for

      25      basically what are established anchorages.







                                                                   73
       1             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  That's the point I'm

       2      trying to understand.

       3             SENATOR MURPHY:  Excuse me.  We are going

       4      respect everybody here tonight, okay?  We'll let

       5      Mr. Kelly finish.

       6             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  That's the hard part I

       7      have communicating to residents is understanding and

       8      knowing tug boat captains that sail up and down the

       9      Hudson River, that what has changed?

      10             Because in an emergency situation or when

      11      there is heavy fog or ice on the river, when it's

      12      unsafe, we expect them to anchor.

      13             And we know, like you talked about the

      14      licensing and credentials that our captains need,

      15      that they would understand and know the Hudson

      16      River.  So it is not all adding up to me in terms of

      17      if you can anchor now, what has changed, or can now

      18      anchor now?  Are they doing it illegally maybe shed

      19      light on that.

      20             EDWARD KELLY:  In any emergency situation,

      21      you can anchor wherever you feel you have to anchor.

      22      The question is if you know there is a designated

      23      anchorage, say you have gear adjustments or things

      24      to make, these are designated spots that have proven

      25      to be safe.







                                                                   74
       1             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  So we could expect, I

       2      guess that now with these designations, that this

       3      would be a destination for cargo traveling up the

       4      Hudson.  So we could expect that they will be

       5      filled.

       6             EDWARD KELLY:  Not filled but they will be

       7      used.  And these as I say, because of the

       8      geophysical characteristics of these particular

       9      locations that are being proposed, these are the

      10      places that are already currently in use because it

      11      is deep enough so that they don't run aground as

      12      they swing, where there is lesser impact to the

      13      current, where there is not a very narrow section of

      14      the river so it precludes other people getting

      15      around them.

      16             There are a lot of factors that go into

      17      finding a good place to anchor without hurting the

      18      bottom, et cetera.

      19             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  As the regulations as we

      20      read them say three barges could be anchored at any

      21      one time.

      22             EDWARD KELLY:  Could be.  In some of them

      23      there is space for one, some two, some four.

      24             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  The ones in this region in

      25      the Westchester-Rockland area, we are talking about







                                                                   75
       1      three each.

       2             And so you don't see that now.  We would only

       3      see one maybe sporadically anchored at a time?

       4             EDWARD KELLY:  And the provision that they

       5      exist does not mean that they will all be used.  And

       6      to go back to the parking lot concept, it doesn't

       7      make economic sense.

       8             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  So why allow that in the

       9      regulations or put that in the regulations?  Are

      10      they expecting some explosion in terms of travel

      11      along the Hudson?

      12             Are they expecting, you know, we talk about

      13      the 600 foot barge, and I guess I might have read it

      14      wrong, but I thought the requirements or the

      15      regulations were allowing for a barge up to 600 feet

      16      to be parked.

      17             EDWARD KELLY:  Those are different types of

      18      vessels than are barges.  There are barges that move

      19      and carry cement.  There is a lot of cement that

      20      moves up here, again construction materials that

      21      move in what are called coastal vessels.

      22             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  So a coastal vessel up to

      23      600 feet could be parked at one of these spots.

      24             EDWARD KELLY:  Yes.  Depending on the amount

      25      of anchor swing and provision, how much space would







                                                                   76
       1      be needed.

       2             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Another thing I have

       3      trouble with, caring deeply about the Hudson and

       4      wanting to preserve its integrity.  You mention

       5      about oil spills or oil leakage in the Hudson, that

       6      none has been documented.

       7             How far back are we talking about that

       8      documentation?

       9             EDWARD KELLY:  That goes back to the corps

      10      records which are not that far back.  It goes back

      11      to about 2010.

      12             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  2010.

      13             EDWARD KELLY:  Six years of impeccable safety

      14      record.  It doesn't go back that long.

      15             These are the same type of anchorages and the

      16      same type of commercial operations that are taking

      17      place in other federal navigable channels, the

      18      Mississippi, Columbia, so this is not unique to the

      19      Hudson Valley.

      20             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  I appreciate your

      21      answering these questions, and it is a delight for

      22      me to have someone who can answer these with

      23      integrity and authority.  The other question I have

      24      is just that many of our elected officials and

      25      residents have brought up is the safety.  And the







                                                                   77
       1      fact that we have to deal with the reality of soft

       2      targets in our community and just the advent of what

       3      type of materials are going to be transported along

       4      the river.

       5             Is there any type of mechanism where local

       6      law enforcement, the community will be notified

       7      about what type of materials are being parked in

       8      their community?  In terms of toxins or crude...

       9             EDWARD KELLY:  We can and do work with state

      10      and municipal entities, their abilities to deal with

      11      different issues, whether they be security based or

      12      environmentally based.

      13             Our industry and Coast Guard and Corps of

      14      Engineers, we work extensively with security-related

      15      things.  Obviously if we want to talk about

      16      security, I'm from New York City.  We know about

      17      9/11.  We don't just talk about it, and we have

      18      existing security protocols that integrate local,

      19      municipal and state first responders, OEMs,

      20      et cetera.

      21             If there are any failures on the part of

      22      communities or state issues to take a look and

      23      consider they ought to engage with people running

      24      and how can we best work together, this industry is

      25      working together.  We have operators that work this







                                                                   78
       1      river work in New York City and the harbor.  We are

       2      the people that lifted the people off Manhattan

       3      Island when the towers came down and it burned.

       4             Bee don't want to talk about security.  We'll

       5      show you security.  We take it seriously in this

       6      business because we lived with it.  We had to take

       7      those people off that burning island that day, and

       8      we have built that.

       9             Captain Sully, those people didn't get off

      10      that plane by accident.  It's because we have

      11      trained and worked and coordinated our commercial

      12      navigators with OEM, New York Department of Fire,

      13      police, all those people.  That's how those people

      14      got off that plane because we drill and practice

      15      that, and your local communities should do it as

      16      well.

      17             And frankly being very blunt, New York State

      18      in this area doesn't spend enough money on doing

      19      what they ought to do to do those things.  We stand

      20      ready to work with people.  We hope the communities

      21      will reach out to us and other organizations like us

      22      to enhance the security and ecology of this river.

      23      It's important to us.  We hope it's also important

      24      to you.  We don't talk about it.  We live security.

      25             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Well, I appreciate your







                                                                   79
       1      commitment to security and that's great to hear.

       2             EDWARD KELLY:  Every one of our professional

       3      Mariners as I've said is a U.S. citizen, they have

       4      extensive background checks.  We have more

       5      background checks than you need to be a member of

       6      NYPD.

       7             We are federal.  It's done by TSA.  We have

       8      transport worker identification credentials with

       9      embedded credentials, picture I.D.s.

      10             We take this seriously.  Every one of our

      11      Mariners has to be certified by Coast Guard.  Every

      12      vessel has to have a vessel security plan.  Every

      13      company has to have a company security plan.  Every

      14      facility needs a facility security plan that is

      15      inspected physically in person by Coast Guard at

      16      least once a year.  Our vessels are certified.  We

      17      are willing to talk about any of this.

      18             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  I appreciate your

      19      commitment to safety and security.  I think what

      20      would be, what is refreshing to hear is the

      21      commitment to work with local law enforcement to

      22      share that information with what is being stored out

      23      in the river.

      24             EDWARD KELLY:  Absolutely.

      25             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Thank you.







                                                                   80
       1             Senator Serino.

       2             SENATOR SERINO:  Ed, I think you can

       3      understand our concern especially with the proximity

       4      to Indian Point nuclear power plant.  I think you'll

       5      hear that from the crowd as we've spoken about

       6      tonight the crazy world we live in now, you never

       7      know what to expect so that is a verified fear that

       8      we all have.

       9             Actually you've given us a lot more

      10      information tonight than we've heard and thank you

      11      for that.  And I think that's what everybody feels

      12      the same way because we didn't have any answers.  We

      13      didn't even have somebody to ask a question to.  I

      14      actually did meet with the Coast Guard, and I asked

      15      them the question about having five barges like tied

      16      up or anchored together, and he couldn't answer yes

      17      or no because I don't think that they have a plan,

      18      and that's a huge part of the problem, and the

      19      unknown is really scaring the daylights out of

      20      everybody.

      21             EDWARD KELLY:  We can help you get to the

      22      right people in Coast Guard.  Again, the people that

      23      just are the administrators and rule making are not

      24      the people that are waterways management security.

      25      So you might have gotten into the wrong people in







                                                                   81
       1      the Coast Guard.  So we know there are people in

       2      Coast Guard that can and will respond to these types

       3      of questions.

       4             SENATOR SERINO:  As you mentioned that they

       5      don't notify us but, you know, they should have

       6      notified us so we could talk to the public, and let

       7      them know what we found out, or at least that there

       8      was a notification that this was even something that

       9      was on the radar.

      10             EDWARD KELLY:  Sure.

      11             SENATOR SERINO:  We didn't know about that.

      12             EDWARD KELLY:  They use the Federal Register.

      13             SENATOR MURPHY:  Three weeks, 2,000 people

      14      signed a petition.  We got questions.  We had to

      15      really kind of start saying -- they wanted to hold a

      16      public hearing in the spring, the Coast Guard.

      17             EDWARD KELLY:  Probably what will happen.

      18             SENATOR MURPHY:  In the spring.  You know

      19      public comments ending December.

      20             EDWARD KELLY:  Public written comments and

      21      the Coast Guard procedures which are standard

      22      federal procedures, once the written comment period

      23      concludes, they evaluate the written comments.  They

      24      put them in the proper piles and however they sort

      25      them out, and based on this, certainly on this







                                                                   82
       1      issue, they would say there is sufficient concern

       2      that they would schedule public hearings.  They put

       3      that into the Federal Register to notify people.

       4      They pick out locations scattered throughout the

       5      region.  They would establish, get places and they

       6      will be open for public hearings, but because of the

       7      public notice period through the Federal Register, I

       8      would expect the real public hearings would start in

       9      the spring.

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  Ed, you know as well as I

      11      do, we are dealing with the federal government, and

      12      you know how that works.  You know how that works.

      13             EDWARD KELLY:  Slowly but surely.

      14             SENATOR MURPHY:  I appreciate your coming out

      15      of your way and getting here.  This is the most

      16      information that I've heard.  We have been asking

      17      questions, and like Senator Serino said, we have had

      18      no one to ask the question to.  You are the first

      19      person, you are the first person.  We can't get in

      20      touch with the Coast Guard.

      21             It's disgraceful that they're not here

      22      tonight.  I have the ultimate respect for our

      23      military and Coast Guard.  I respect them, but this

      24      doesn't hold water, so to speak.  It doesn't hold

      25      water.







                                                                   83
       1             Thank you for being here.

       2             EDWARD KELLY:  Thank you.  If anybody would

       3      like a followup, please.

       4             MATT SLATER:  Next we are going to be

       5      inviting county legislators John G. Testa and

       6      Barbara Scuccimarra.  Barbara is representing

       7      MaryEllen Odell, County Executive of Putnam County.

       8             SENATOR MURPHY:  Excuse me, Ed, I know you

       9      are being bombarded.  I don't mean to be

      10      disrespectful.  I would like to keep this moving if

      11      we can go outside.

      12             Thank you County Legislator Testa, County

      13      Legislator Scuccimarra.  Thank you for being here.

      14             LEGISLATOR BARBARA SCUCCIMARRA:  Thank you

      15      for having this tonight.

      16             SENATOR MURPHY:  Excuse me, can we respect

      17      everybody's time here, please.

      18             LEGISLATOR BARBARA SCUCCIMARRA:  I appreciate

      19      you having this public hearing.  I attended your

      20      August public hearing, and that was the first time I

      21      heard about this and my community.  And on behalf

      22      Putnam County Executive MaryEllen Odell and the

      23      Putnam County Legislature, I stand with my community

      24      in opposition to the Coast Guard proposed rule.

      25             The west side of Putnam county borders the







                                                                   84
       1      Hudson from Bear Mountain Bridge to Beacon, and

       2      although we are only a little bit in there, we value

       3      our river, and we value the river communities, and

       4      we have to stand together.

       5             I've lived on the river for over 40 years.

       6      Or near the river.  I overlook it.  And I see barges

       7      all the time going up and down the river, and

       8      actually it's a lovely sight to see these barges.

       9      But what this gentleman is talking about, this

      10      increased amount of these barges, I think, is going

      11      to be problematic, no matter how you look at it.

      12             And the fact that they're so increased and

      13      they're going to be parking in the middle of the

      14      river at times.  And when you had your public

      15      hearing, we were in Verplank, and just looking out

      16      at the water, and I think one barge is too many

      17      barges.

      18             You have to respect the people that live

      19      along the river.  You have to.  Parking acres of

      20      barges -- now first we heard 10 locations and now

      21      it's 16, would risk undoing environmental efforts

      22      which have transformed a sick, polluted river into a

      23      vibrant and beautiful ecological environment that

      24      continues to draw people.  And that's what we have

      25      to focus on.  We can't focus on the commerce.  I'm







                                                                   85
       1      sorry.  We have to focus on the people that live

       2      along the river and enjoy the river.  The fishermen,

       3      the boaters.  I can't even wrap my head around more

       4      barges on that river.  I just can't do that.

       5             Millions of gallons of bakken crude oil --

       6      and Scenic Hudson touched on this -- are being

       7      transported by rail along the river.  These trains

       8      lack any of the basic safety mechanisms and are a

       9      constant threat to all our communities.  Bakken

      10      crude oil is a very heavy consistency that sinks,

      11      and it is very flammable.

      12             Our communities along the river are not

      13      capable of fighting a fire of bakken crude.  They're

      14      not.  And by the time the Coast Guard gets there,

      15      it's going to be devastating.

      16             SENATOR MURPHY:  As he said.

      17             LEGISLATOR BARBARA SCUCCIMARRA:  A resolution

      18      has been drafted and sent in opposition to this

      19      proposed rule, and we are in communication with the

      20      governor and the Secretary of State to have this not

      21      move forward.

      22             You know, again, I thank you all for having

      23      this, and I thank people like you for coming to this

      24      because these are the people that are going to stop

      25      this.  These are the people.







                                                                   86
       1             I don't mean to date myself, but back in the

       2      70s, they proposed a hydro electric plant on Storm

       3      King Mountain, and if it wasn't for Scenic Hudson

       4      and grassroots efforts, that mountain would have

       5      been destroyed.  But it was stopped.  So I'm hoping

       6      the same thing will happen here.  Thank you so much.

       7             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you.

       8             [ Applause ]

       9             LEGISLATOR JOHN TESTA:  Thank you for fitting

      10      me in with Barbara.  This is a pleasure.  And I

      11      really want to thank you, Senator Murphy, for

      12      spearheading this and the other senators for being a

      13      part of it and to really bring this to the public

      14      eye.

      15             As you mentioned before, we would not have

      16      known about it, and we have known with the federal

      17      government, if you don't find out early enough in

      18      the process, you are not going to do anything about

      19      it.  So by having the early warning signs and to

      20      have our voices heard early and now tonight to put

      21      them on notice again, I think is very, very

      22      important.

      23             I was pleased to be able to bring a

      24      resolution to the Board of Legislators in

      25      Westchester, unanimously approved by all my







                                                                   87
       1      colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  That

       2      resolution has been posted to the Coast Guard site

       3      so they know the County of Westchester as we know

       4      with the County Executive are against these, against

       5      this proposal.

       6             And it seems to me after tonight, this is

       7      really a matter of volume.  As Barbara said, we've

       8      always seen boats going up and barges and tug boats

       9      going up and down the Hudson.  I grew up on

      10      Peekskill on the river.  This is a volume problem

      11      and we have to think of it as the worst case

      12      scenario, as we do in government with all the things

      13      we plan.  When you see a full contingent of barges

      14      parked in these areas, it's taking up the whole

      15      center of the river just about, and our area

      16      especially.

      17             What I'm concerned about is the safety on all

      18      aspects that was mentioned tonight -- I'm not going

      19      to reiterate everything that has been said -- but

      20      just look what happened when the Tappan Zee Bridge

      21      started.  There was one barge put there for the

      22      staging for the beginning of the construction, and

      23      there as was a fatal accident there with just one

      24      barge.  Think of all the barges up and down the

      25      center of the Hudson what could happen for







                                                                   88
       1      recreational boaters.  Who is this going to fall on?

       2      Is it going to fall on the counties and individual

       3      municipalities?  Are they going to have to have

       4      maritime response teams?  Are they going to have to

       5      expand their police force?  Expand their fire

       6      departments?  Millions and millions of dollars per

       7      community is going to be needed.  Where that money

       8      going to come from?  Is the federal government going

       9      to subsidize?  I don't think so.

      10             SENATOR MURPHY:  Can you say unfunded

      11      mandate?

      12             LEGISLATOR JOHN TESTA:  Perfect.  I won't get

      13      into my schoolteacher mode of historic lecture, but

      14      this area, the Verplank Montrose area, Stony Point

      15      and Heritage River, this is the cradle of our nation

      16      was formed there.  People might not realize it, but

      17      it's the most historic area in our country as far as

      18      I'm concerned.  Protecting West Point, the whole

      19      issue of the spies and Benedict Arnold, that has

      20      become a very popular narrative over the past few

      21      years.  Books have been written about it movies made

      22      about it.  TV shows have been made about it.  This

      23      is where it happened.  People come here just to see

      24      that area because that's where history began for our

      25      United States of America.







                                                                   89
       1             So to have barges all up and down the Hudson,

       2      people don't come to see barges.  That's not what

       3      they are coming for.  They're coming to enjoy the

       4      Hudson.  Just in my lifetime so much has been

       5      tremendously done to improve the Hudson River.  We

       6      used to go swimming even though we were told not to

       7      back in the day.  Now it's not even a problem to go

       8      out there and jump in the river, and people do it

       9      all the time.  It's going to change, and we can't

      10      let that change after all this hard work we've done.

      11      Thank you for letting us stay.

      12             SENATOR MURPHY:  Very briefly.  You know, as

      13      a resident of Peekskill, you have been there a

      14      number of years, the former mayor of Peekskill you

      15      have been there a number of years, and now as the

      16      county legislator, you have seen drastic, drastic

      17      changes that have gone on there.  That walkway is

      18      just absolutely beautiful what has gone on down

      19      there, and to turn around and start walking down

      20      that walk way and see niece anchorage sites and

      21      barges to be able to park there with the investment

      22      that some of your business owners put down there and

      23      it's just not right.

      24             Barb, thank you for being there from day one.

      25             LEGISLATOR BARBARA SCUCCIMARRA:  Sure.







                                                                   90
       1             SENATOR MURPHY:  You came to the first public

       2      comment period that we had, our press conference

       3      just to pound the drum on this and get it notified,

       4      you know, so I appreciate all that you do and thank

       5      you for you being you and representing the county

       6      executive up in Putnam County.  So keep up the great

       7      work and thank you for being here tonight, and I'm

       8      sorry you had to wait for so long.

       9             MATT SLATER:  Next up we have John Cronin of

      10      the Pace University Environmental Law School.

      11             John?

      12             JOHN CRONIN:  Good evening.

      13             SENATOR MURPHY:  Good evening, John.  Thank

      14      you for being here.

      15             JOHN CRONIN:  Thank you.  I appreciate each

      16      one of you holding this meeting tonight.

      17             My name is John Cronin.  I'm senior fellow

      18      for environmental affairs at the Pace University

      19      Academy for Applied Environmental Studies.  I'm a

      20      resident of Cold Spring, New York.

      21             And Senator Serino, when I was a commercial

      22      fisherman I lived on the docks in Nyack, New York.

      23             Senator Murphy, I'm here tonight with my

      24      co-faculty Michelle Land from the Land Environmental

      25      Policy Clinic and students from the clinic where you







                                                                   91
       1      are our environmental hero for reasons that don't

       2      relate to even to the Coast Guard.  The Elephant

       3      Protection Act which our students worked with you

       4      on, and you delivered for us in New York State

       5      Senate, and we are greatly appreciative of that.

       6             I want to start out my comments by saying

       7      something about the Coast Guard.  We throw the term

       8      Coast Guard around very loosely.  Let's be clear

       9      about something.  The rank and file of the Coast

      10      Guard is our front line of maritime defense for

      11      Homeland Security.  They do drug interdiction, they

      12      do spilled response.  The Coast Guard swimmers are

      13      amongst the bravest of those in the American

      14      service, and I have nothing but the greatest respect

      15      for the Coast Guard rank and file.

      16             But as those in the maritime industry like to

      17      say, and they do, there are two Coast Guards.  There

      18      is the rank and file Coast Guard who does everything

      19      that I told you about, and there is what they call

      20      the other Coast Guard.  And I want to talk a little

      21      bit tonight about the other Coast Guard.

      22             If you asked anyone five years ago to

      23      describe the maritime nexus for South Dakota, they

      24      probably would have said zero.  The bakken oil

      25      fields have changed that dynamic dramatically as







                                                                   92
       1      tank barges move product to market.  It is no

       2      coincidence that Senator Thune of South Dakota is

       3      chairman of the Senate Committee with oversight for

       4      the Coast Guard.  South Dakota most certainly has a

       5      maritime nexus today.

       6             Those are not my words.  Those are the words

       7      of Admiral Paul, the head of the Coast Guard at the

       8      annual meeting of the American Waterways Operators

       9      last April.

      10             He concluded his remarks by saying the Coast

      11      Guard will facilitate economic prosperity.  Let's be

      12      clear that is not the Coast Guard's job.  The Coast

      13      Guard's job is navigation.  The Coast Guard's job is

      14      safety.  The Coast Guard's job is the health of the

      15      environment.  It is not to facilitate the commercial

      16      success of the oil industry.  But that was the...

      17             [ Applause ]

      18             But that was the thrust of his remarks at the

      19      American Waterway operators last April at their

      20      annual meeting.

      21             And why is this important?  It's important

      22      because the special anchorage designation that the

      23      Coast Guard is asking for is exempt from the

      24      National Environmental Policy Act.  A federal

      25      regulation that exempts the Coast Guard from having







                                                                   93
       1      to do an environmental impact statement under the

       2      National Environmental Policy Act because special

       3      anchorages are an exempt activity.

       4             Now the problem with exempt activities is

       5      that they're pretty broad.  Once you've got that

       6      power, you've got that power.  You can declare a

       7      special anchorage, and you are exempt.  You don't

       8      have to do an environmental impact statement.

       9             I would argue that even if this is not --

      10      does not fly in the face of the letter of the law,

      11      it does in the spirit.  It is clear to me, and a lot

      12      of people have looked at this issue, that in fact

      13      this is about facilitating economic growth outside

      14      of New York State.  It is not about navigation and

      15      safety.  And I will get to some of those issues.

      16             And let me just tell you for those of you who

      17      don't know.  I've spent a lot of time on the Hudson

      18      River.  I've worked on it for 43 years.  I'm a

      19      former licensed Coast Guard captain.  I was the

      20      Hudson Riverkeeper for 17 years.  I was a commercial

      21      fisherman for three years on the Hudson River.  I

      22      know my way around the river.

      23             SENATOR MURPHY:  I'm going to consider you an

      24      expert.

      25             [ Applause ]







                                                                   94
       1             JOHN CRONIN:  Better others say it than I,

       2      but -- and part of that experience is some pretty

       3      dramatic stuff.  In 1977, I was one of the

       4      organizers of the bird cleaning station in Rockland

       5      county when the Ethel H. barge went up on Con Hook

       6      Reef and spilled over 640,000 gallons of fuel oil in

       7      the Hudson River, fuel oil that took over a year to

       8      dissipate.

       9             I cleaned the birds.  I watched the birds

      10      die.  My brother helped us at the bird cleaning

      11      station.  He euthanized the birds that couldn't make

      12      it anymore.  We saw their dissolved internal organs

      13      from trying to preen themselves of the oil.

      14             This is serious business when you are talking

      15      about the transport of oil.  If we were doing an

      16      environmental impact statement on this proposal, I

      17      want you to consider what actually would be in

      18      writing right now because you said very rightfully,

      19      Senator Murphy, that we don't have enough

      20      information.

      21             If there were an environmental impact

      22      statement, it would spell out the environmental

      23      impacts, the social impacts, the cultural impacts,

      24      the visual impacts, the economic impacts and any

      25      contributory impacts to climate change.  It would







                                                                   95
       1      have to spell out alternatives to special anchorages

       2      including the no action alternative, and it would

       3      have to give all the reasons to defend every one of

       4      those alternatives.

       5             Now by way of example, in Kingston, New York,

       6      the Hudson River pilots call Kingston, New York, the

       7      point of no return.  They call it the point of no

       8      return because there is not room for more than one

       9      vessel.  And once the vessel is committed up there,

      10      that vessel cannot turn around until it gets up to

      11      the point of Albany.  They call it the point of no

      12      return.

      13             SENATOR MURPHY:  Didn't know that.

      14             JOHN CRONIN:  Here is the question that would

      15      have to be answered in an environmental impact

      16      statement.  If above Kingston is such a narrow

      17      channel that it is the point of no return, why do we

      18      need 17 anchorages in Yonkers, New York?

      19             It doesn't compute why we would need 17

      20      anchorages in Yonkers, New York, when 70 miles

      21      upriver you can't squeeze more than one tug and

      22      barge on its way to the port of Albany.

      23             Explaining that is important.  We are not

      24      seeing those explanations, and I don't think we are

      25      going to.  We are going see contested testimony in a







                                                                   96
       1      spring hearing.  Were there an environmental impact

       2      statement, however, we would see all of this and

       3      more.

       4             So what is the Coast Guard asking us to do?

       5      The Coast Guard is asking us to trust the Coast

       6      Guard.  I trust the rank and file of the Coast

       7      Guard.  My problem with is the decision makers.  And

       8      let me give you a firsthand experience that I had.

       9             In 1983, in my first year as Hudson

      10      Riverkeeper, I spent the summer training oil tankers

      11      up and down the Hudson River.  They would anchor at

      12      the anchorage Port Ewen and anchor at the anchorage

      13      at Kingston.  They would rinse themselves out, fill

      14      up with Hudson River water, they would bring the

      15      water to the island of Aruba.  When they anchored at

      16      the village of Port Ewen, they discharged benzene,

      17      ethyl benzine, toluene and xylene 1500 feet from the

      18      drinking water intake of the village of Port Ewen. I

      19      personally did the sampling from the tanker, and we

      20      brought it to a laboratory.

      21             We brought the information and the evidence

      22      to the United States Coast Guard, and this is what

      23      the United States Coast Guard said.  We decline to

      24      investigate because this is part of the normal

      25      operations of the vessel.







                                                                   97
       1             Now were there an environmental impact

       2      statement, the issue of monitoring enforcement would

       3      also have to be addressed.

       4             In 1990, there were what was called the high

       5      grade spill.  It was A barge that went up on Diamond

       6      Reef, a kerosene spill that dumped 164,000 gallons

       7      of kerosene into the Hudson River.  These reefs I'm

       8      talking about are well known navigation hazards on

       9      the Hudson.

      10             The immediate Coast Guard response, and its

      11      public statement to the newspapers was, it was due

      12      to high winds and choppy water.  The winds that

      13      night were 8 to 10 miles per hour with occasional

      14      gusts to 20.  It was a clear night, and months after

      15      those public statements were made to the newspapers,

      16      "The New York Times," "The Times Herald Record,"

      17      months after that an investigation was done, and the

      18      captain was suspended.

      19             But the first inclination, the first response

      20      of the Coast Guard was it was the fault of the

      21      river.  It was not the fault of the captain behind

      22      the wheel.

      23             You can see this repeated in incident after

      24      incident.  In the 1980s to 1990, there were over a

      25      period of one decade, there were 10 significant







                                                                   98
       1      spills by barges going up on reefs in the Hudson

       2      River.  In June 5, 1991, there was a Congressional

       3      hearing held.  I testified at this Congressional

       4      hearing.  I had also testified at a Congressional

       5      hearing about navigation two years before the

       6      Merchant Marine Fisheries Committee.  That doesn't

       7      exist anymore, but when they had the subcommittee at

       8      navigation and the Coast Guard.  I proposed, and

       9      Congresswoman Nita Lowey proposed that any tug and

      10      barge that brought hazardous cargo up the Hudson

      11      River should have an independent Hudson River pilot

      12      aboard in addition to the captain to assure the

      13      safety of that tug and barge.

      14             The reason for this is Hudson River pilots

      15      are required on board tankers, and you have to look

      16      long and hard to find a tanker accident on the

      17      Hudson River because the Hudson River pilots are on

      18      board.  But guess what?  The Coast Guard showed up

      19      at the hearing and testified against the idea.  They

      20      said there was no evidence that there were safety

      21      problems.  There were no evidence that there were

      22      accidents, and the commercial industry testified

      23      against it because they said it would increase their

      24      costs for navigating on the Hudson River.

      25             Now mind you, every single one of these







                                                                   99
       1      spills had a licensed captain behind the wheel, but

       2      almost none of them had significant Hudson River

       3      experience.  I'm replaying this history to you to

       4      explain to you in part the real world problems that

       5      we have had on the Hudson River when navigation

       6      and-- I take that back.  The Coast Guard calls it

       7      incidents.  They don't call them accidents and for

       8      good reason.  When I trained for my Coast Guard

       9      license, what was drilled into me there is no such

      10      thing as an accident.  There is somebody's fault and

      11      an act of God.  That's all there is, and this is

      12      true.  On the water, there is somebody's fault, and

      13      there is an act of God.  There is no in between.

      14      That's the way it works, and not one of those barge

      15      incidents was due to an act of God.

      16             Now when I look at this proposal, I look at

      17      other things as well.  We have a rich history of

      18      having had a commercial fishery on the Hudson River.

      19      I was a commercial fisherman for three years, part

      20      of the time living in the back of a pickup truck on

      21      the Bird Street Dock working with the Gabrielson

      22      family.

      23             We used to have hundreds of commercial

      24      fishermen on the Hudson River.  And there is a sad

      25      story there.  Striped bass and American eel were







                                                                   100
       1      banned from fishing in 1976.  Sturgeon were banned

       2      from fishing in 1996.  Shad was banned from fishing

       3      in 2010.  The net commercial net fisheries no longer

       4      occupies the Hudson River.  We wanted to some day,

       5      but a lot of these anchorages will be located in

       6      former commercial fishing locations.  In other

       7      words, the federal government is giving up on the

       8      idea that we are going to have commercial fishermen

       9      again on the Hudson River.

      10             To me, if nothing else, this is totally

      11      unacceptable.  This is part of our working life on

      12      the Hudson, part of our culture and history, an

      13      economic safety net in times of economic duress for

      14      people who needed another income.  This is important

      15      for us.  Commercial fishermen are not the cause of

      16      any of them losing their jobs.  The federal

      17      government has a lot to do with them losing their

      18      jobs.

      19             And so let me turn my attention to that just

      20      for a moment before I conclude.  The federal

      21      government has a lot to answer for on the Hudson

      22      River, and the Coast Guard proposal is the latest.

      23      Since the 1960s, citizens groups on the Hudson

      24      River, and this is no exaggeration, have spent tens

                                                                   101
       1      reached close to $60 million to $70 million at this

       2      point fighting federal proposals.

       3             Make no mistake.  The Storm King Mountain

       4      proposal that Barbara Scuccimarra referred to, yes,

       5      it was a Con Ed proposal, a Federal Power Commission

       6      proposal in the exact same way the proposal in front

       7      of us tonight is not a proposal from American

       8      Waterway Operators.  It's a proposal from the Coast

       9      Guard, because when we testified, when Congressman

      10      Lowey and I testified and went to the Coast Guard

      11      and said we want better safety measures in the pilot

      12      house, in those tugs, the Coast Guard didn't take

      13      our idea and publish it for everybody to comment on.

      14      The Coast Guard filtered it out.  The Coast Guard

      15      publishes things it wants.

      16             So make no mistake about it.  This is in the

      17      Federal Register because the Coast Guard wants it.

      18      If the Coast Guard didn't want it, it would never

      19      see print, in the same way our request for

      20      requirement for pilots and better training for

      21      captains never saw print in the proposed regulation

      22      from the Coast Guard on the Hudson River.

      23             The Hudson River Expressway that would fill

      24      in the shallows of the Hudson River in Westchester

      25      County, Westway, that would have filled in the







                                                                   102
       1      striped bass spawning wintering grounds off the

       2      coast of Manhattan, the PCB discharge permit given

       3      by the E.P.A. to General Electric in 1973 when the

       4      E.P.A. had in its hand a report that said it would

       5      result in the contamination of Hudson River striped

       6      bass.

       7             I can go through a list of these, at least a

       8      dozen incidents and proposals by the federal

       9      government that we have had to fight over the last

      10      four to five decades to keep this Hudson River safe,

      11      this Coast Guard proposal is the latest.

      12             Let me give you something to contrast this

      13      with.  Does anybody here want to guess how much

      14      money Congress is going to spend on protection,

      15      restoration and rebuilding of Chesapeake Bay next

      16      year -- this year -- on the Chesapeake Bay estuary?

      17      They're going to spend $65 million restoring and

      18      protecting the Chesapeake Bay estuary in a special

      19      program for the Chesapeake Bay that has a permanent

      20      line item in the Congressional budget every single

      21      year.

      22             There is no such line item for the Hudson

      23      River.  We are here talking about a backroom fight

      24      to protect this river when we should be having a

      25      hearing about is how much money should the federal







                                                                   103
       1      government be investing in the restoration of the

       2      Hudson River and estuary?

       3             [ Applause ]

       4             Not fighting off yet another agency proposal.

       5      When is the commercial fishery coming back?  When

       6      are the shores of our cities going to be rebuilt?

       7      Where are the docks for the tour boats that used to

       8      be the boast of the Hudson River that brought people

       9      up here by water?

      10             Let's not bring oil up here by water.  Let's

      11      bring people up here by water for God's sakes.

      12      That's what we should be doing on the Hudson River.

      13             But most of all, I want to stress to you, and

      14      I implore you to make this request, and I invite the

      15      Maritime Association of the Port of New York and

      16      New Jersey to join us in a request that the Coast

      17      Guard do a full environmental impact statement with

      18      all the alternatives, all the impacts from social to

      19      economic to environmental so that we can examine

      20      this proposal and the kind of detail that it should

      21      be examined.  And then let's start talking about the

      22      money we should be spending from the federal

      23      government on restoring this river, not creating

      24      anchorages for bakken oil from South Dakota because

      25      the senator from South Dakota is the chair of the







                                                                   104
       1      Coast Guard subcommittee.

       2             JOHN CRONIN:  Thank you very much.

       3             [ Applause ]

       4             SENATOR MURPHY:  John, one second if you

       5      don't mind.  Like I said, like I said, thank you.

       6      Thank you for being here tonight.  You are a

       7      plethora of information.  The stuff that you can

       8      dial in on, I would love to make sure that if you

       9      are available when we have more of these things

      10      because you know what we are up against.  I love the

      11      analogy of the rank and file versus the really --

      12      the kind of nonsense that we get put into.  And when

      13      they do that E.I.S., it's going to be this big.

      14      It's going to be that big.  It is going to be

      15      unbelievable, and I did not know that it was -- they

      16      did not -- it was the anchorage were exempt.  I did

      17      not know that.

      18             JOHN CRONIN:  Special anchorages are exempt.

      19      It's a Coast Guard regulation.

      20             SENATOR MURPHY:  So I thank you for being

      21      here tonight.  I know you have been at the press

      22      conferences, and you are an information source for

      23      myself that I can only just learn more from you and

      24      dial this in and we can fight it together.

      25             So thank you for going out of your way and







                                                                   105
       1      I'm sorry we couldn't get you on earlier.

       2             JOHN CRONIN:  Let me ask one final thought

       3      before I walk away.  If the Coast Guard does not --

       4      refuses to do an E.I.S., our environmental policy

       5      clinic is in the midst of preparing a massive

       6      freedom of information request that goes back 30

       7      years, trying to get the documentation that would

       8      show up in an E.I.S.

       9             The December 6 deadline should be extended

      10      because we have to engage in our own process to

      11      collect the information.  And they have 20 days to

      12      respond to the freedom of information request.  It's

      13      going to take them probably two months to comply

      14      with it, and the hearing and notice, the comment

      15      period will be over.

      16             This comment period should be extended and

      17      there should be -- the record should be open and

      18      included in the hearing that takes place in the

      19      spring.  There is no reason to close the record now

      20      or any time between now and when the hearing takes

      21      place.

      22             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thank you very much.

      23             [ Applause ]

      24             MATT SLATER:  Thank you, John.

      25             Our next speaker is Betsy Garthwaite.  She is







                                                                   106
       1      the Chairman of the Board for Clearwater.

       2             Betsy?

       3             BETSY GARTHWAITE:  Good evening.  Whoever's

       4      idea it was that I had to follow John Cronin --

       5             [ Laughter ]

       6             SENATOR MURPHY:  A tough act to follow, huh.

       7             BETSY GARTHWAITE:  I want to thank the

       8      senators tonight and especially Senator Murphy for

       9      reaching out to Clearwater to ask us to participate

      10      this evening.

      11             My name is Betsy Garthwaite, and I am the

      12      president of the Board of Directors of Hudson River

      13      Clearwater and also former captain of the Sloop

      14      Clearwater, and for the record as a United States

      15      Coast Guard captain, I have a deep respect for other

      16      maritime professionals and their concerns about

      17      safety.

      18             As most everyone knows, the Sloop Clearwater

      19      was the brainchild of the late folk singer Pete

      20      Seeger.  Pete had an idea to build a replica of the

      21      old Hudson River sailing vessels of 18th and 19th

      22      centuries not just as a nod to the valley's maritime

      23      history, but as a way to focus people's attention on

      24      what was then a very polluted Hudson River.  And

      25      Pete's scheme worked.







                                                                   107
       1             That first summer in 1969, the sloop

       2      attracted many thousands of people in waterfront

       3      communities up and down the river.  Today, nearly

       4      50 years after Clearwater first sailed up the

       5      Hudson, the river is noticeably cleaner.

       6             No one environmental organization, no one

       7      piece of clean water legislation, no one lawsuit can

       8      take credit for cleaning up the Hudson.  It took

       9      many organizations and government leaders and

      10      concerned citizens coming together and working

      11      toward a common goal.  And because of the efforts of

      12      people decades ago, and the ongoing efforts of

      13      people today, we live in one of the most beautiful

      14      regions in these United States.

      15             The Hudson is no longer a place that people

      16      avoid.  Rather, people flock to it.  They swim in

      17      the river, fish in the river, canoe, kayak and wind

      18      surf, dine along the river's edge.  You name it.

      19      Just about any recreational activity that can be

      20      done on the water or next to the water is happening

      21      up and down the Hudson.

      22             Today, tourism is a multi-billion-dollar

      23      industry here in the valley, and it is growing with

      24      every year.  But now the maritime ministry has

      25      requested 10 additional federally-designated







                                                                   108
       1      anchorages between Yonkers and Kingston with a total

       2      capacity up to 43 vessels.  By its own admission,

       3      this request is being made due to the anticipated

       4      increase in traffic of bakken crude oil on the

       5      Hudson after the lifting of the crude oil export ban

       6      last December.

       7             Our communities will be assuming a huge

       8      amount of risk with the promise of little to no

       9      reward from the increase in shipments of crude oil

      10      which, unlike the home heating oil that is

      11      transported upriver each winter, is not intended for

      12      our consumption.  This oil will be headed overseas.

      13             I believe that the Hudson River is

      14      New York State's greatest natural resource, and the

      15      Hudson has always had value to the people of

      16      New York and New Jersey as a shipping route.  But

      17      those interests have got to be balanced with the

      18      many other interests that we, as residents of the

      19      valley, also hold dear and depend on.

      20             I believe that additional anchorages are not

      21      in the best interest of Hudson River residents, and

      22      on behalf of the Clearwater organization, exempt or

      23      not, I am asking the Coast Guard for a full

      24      environmental impact statement.

      25             Funny that John mentioned the ethyl h today.







                                                                   109
       1      I was going to bring it up myself.  To this day, it

       2      is my understanding that it was the largest single

       3      crude oil spill to occur in the river north of

       4      New York Harbor, and the bird cleaning center that

       5      was set up operated around the clock for 10 days by

       6      volunteers and professionals caring for the captured

       7      birds.

       8             Early attempts at using dish detergent to

       9      clean those birds proved ineffective, so a solvent

      10      made by the Shell Oil company was used which

      11      required the cleaners to don suits, gloves and

      12      respirators.  The Coast Guard responded to the spill

      13      with a 300-person team.  By their own estimate, they

      14      recovered less than 25% of the oil spilled.  Of the

      15      hundreds or even thousands of birds that may have

      16      been contaminated, just 50 were captured, and one

      17      third of them did not survive.

      18             This is a stark reminder that nearly 40 years

      19      later, our ability to clean up spills and save

      20      wildlife has not improved greatly.  We can put a

      21      price on the value of a tanker full of crude oil.

      22      We can also put a price on the cost of an oil spill

      23      cleanup and resulting economic damage.  These spills

      24      may be uncommon in part thanks to the

      25      professionalism of the Hudson River pilots and the







                                                                   110
       1      tug and barge captains and crew, but they do happen.

       2      And make no mistake, oil companies consider such

       3      spills part of the cost of doing business.

       4             There is one thing, however, that we can't

       5      put a price tag on, and that's the quality of life

       6      we enjoy here in the Hudson Valley today, and I

       7      believe that quality of life is worth protecting.

       9             SENATOR MURPHY:  Betsy, I'm sorry had you to

      10      go after John, but thank you very much for being

      11      here tonight and testifying because this is all

      12      being recorded by the New York State Senate, and

      13      it's going to be distributed to the Coast Guard.

      14      And the E.I.S. is a great start.

      15             [ Applause ]

      16             BETSY GARTHWAITE:  Thank you very much.

      17             SENATOR SERINO:  Thank you, Betsy.  Thank

      18      you.

      19             MATT SLATER:  John Parker is with us.  He is

      20      the Director of Legal Programs for Riverkeeper.

      21             John, thank you for being here.

      22             JOHN PARKER:  Thank you, sir.

      23             SENATOR MURPHY:  Thanks, John.

      24             JOHN PARKER:  Thank you, Senators.

      25             On behalf of Riverkeeper, its members and







                                                                   111
       1      constituents, we thank you for calling attention to

       2      the request for 10 new anchorage grounds with 43

       3      berths in the Hudson River.

       4             In the many concerns that have been expressed

       5      by numerous people today, I'm going to go through a

       6      couple of things again because I think it bears

       7      important merit to talk about some of the aspects of

       8      the claims with respect to the justification for

       9      these proposals and a little bit of the detail about

      10      the environmental impact statement process.  So here

      11      we go.

      12             SENATOR MURPHY:  You're on.

      13             JOHN PARKER:  Thank you.  Ready.

      14             Riverkeeper opposes the proposed request for

      15      additional anchorages because it is clearly driven

      16      by a desire to vastly increase industrialization,

      17      reindustrialization of this river corridor, and

      18      because the industry has tied the need to increase

      19      safety, instead of the vast increase in crude oil

      20      transport to and from Albany.

      21             The river has had its share of industry and

      22      industry impacts, and the public now with its

      23      overwhelming outpouring of concern, condemnation and

      24      critique, is pushing back to say no more.

      25             The advanced proposed rule making requested







                                                                   112
       1      by the maritime industry to establish new anchorage

       2      grounds is particularly discouraging given the time

       3      that has been spent in the recovery of the river and

       4      the communities along it.  They are finally

       5      rebounding from a legacy of its industrial past.

       6             Our residents and communities appreciate the

       7      Hudson as a living river in ways that are much

       8      stronger today and much stronger than they've ever

       9      been before, and this understanding is increasing.

      10             Riverkeeper's concerns about the proposed

      11      dramatic increase in anchorage grounds focuses on

      12      two core areas:  First, the industry's claims

      13      regarding the need for additional anchorage grounds

      14      will go through now are unsubstantiated, and second,

      15      as we've heard discussed tonight, should this

      16      advanced proposal become an actual proposal, it must

      17      be subject to a full and comprehensive environmental

      18      impact statement, and that includes things like we

      19      are doing here tonight:  Robust public participation

      20      and opportunity for those impacted to have their say

      21      before any decisions are made.

      22             So are the increased number of anchorage

      23      grounds necessary?  We say no.  We say the facts say

      24      no.

      25             The Coast Guard has the power to define and







                                                                   113
       1      establish anchorage grounds, and they have that

       2      power for over a century under existing law.  The

       3      maritime industry on January 21 of this year claimed

       4      that the anchorages are, quote, critical to

       5      America's economy, navigational safety,

       6      environmental protection and energy independence.

       7             There are many factual points that refute

       8      these claims.  First, commercial vessels already

       9      have the ability to anchor in the event of any

      10      unexpected events or conditions which place them at

      11      risk, including mechanical failure or

      12      weather-related hazards.

      13             Hurricane Sandy is an excellent example of

      14      the Coast Guard giving emergency and temporary

      15      authorization in times of trouble to multiple

      16      vessels in the harbor of New York.

      17             In fact, these types of requests for

      18      authorization are always granted for safety.  The

      19      industry lobbyists we've heard tonight have admitted

      20      such.  Second, Riverkeeper's patrol boats and staff,

      21      some of which have spoken tonight, have patrolled

      22      the Hudson estuary and the river for thousands and

      23      thousands of miles and many, many years.

      24             JOHN CRONIN:  The industry's request for

      25      43 berths in 10 areas does not appear to be related







                                                                   114
       1      to any demonstrated need.  We have never witnessed

       2      within a half dozen commercial vessels anchored

       3      between the George Washington Bridge in Albany in

       4      the existing two authorized anchorage grounds.

       5             In fact, only on the rarest of occasions are

       6      the existing Hyde Park and Yonkers anchorages full.

       7      Third, on closer examination, the fact that industry

       8      has requested eight berths at the Kingston hub which

       9      we have heard discussed tonight, and 16 additional

      10      berths at the existing Yonkers anchorage grounds,

      11      clearly show the true reason for the request.  The

      12      Kingston hub is the Northern-most area of the river

      13      with swinging room for large vessels.

      14             The Yonkers extension is the closest

      15      anchorage to the Port of New York and New Jersey.

      16      There is no possible safety-related scenario where

      17      eight additional vessels would need emergency

      18      anchorages in Kingston and where 16 additional

      19      vessels would be needed for emergency anchors off

      20      Yonkers.  No possible scenario.

      21             The industry representatives have made clear

      22      their security and security credentials that

      23      demonstrate there are few, in fact, few emergencies,

      24      and again, when and where they can anchor in those

      25      emergencies.  Simply the proposal is an effort to







                                                                   115
       1      expand the ports of Albany and New York Harbor to

       2      relieve congestion and support an expansion of

       3      commercial transport of oil as we'll discuss.

       4             It is not about recreational use increasing,

       5      and it's not about using traditionally-used

       6      anchorages.

       7             Fourth, both the oil and maritime industries

       8      expect a significant increase in crude oil

       9      transport.  This is tied to the 2015 federal

      10      government's action that lifted the ban on the

      11      export of oil to foreign nations.

      12             The many millions gallons of crude that

      13      already travel this corridor will be dramatically

      14      increased, but for foreign markets.

      15             Fifth, transport of crude oil on the Hudson

      16      Valley presents unacceptable threats to public

      17      health as we've heard tonight.  For example, again,

      18      public drinking water supplies are along the Hudson

      19      River and use the Hudson River as that supply.

      20             The shipment of crude oil on the Hudson River

      21      itself is a hazardous condition because spills are

      22      essentially unrecoverable.  And it only takes one

      23      such spill to wreak havoc here.  That needs to be

      24      stressed.  It doesn't need to be multiple for us to

      25      get the point.







                                                                   116
       1             Bakken crude which has been discussed tonight

       2      from the midwest cannot be recovered in moving water

       3      bodies like the Hudson River.  Burning bakken is

       4      left to burn itself out.

       5             Again and again, we've seen examples where

       6      the fires are too hot to extinguish.  It is the

       7      risk.

       8             Further, the tar sand crude oil that might be

       9      coming as well in the future, if spilled, sinks to

      10      the bottom, not recoverable.

      11             Despite industry claims that there is no need

      12      for the additional anchorages to support delivery of

      13      refined petroleum products -- sorry, excuse me.

      14      There is no need for additional barges to bring

      15      refined oil products to and from Albany.

      16             For many, many decades, as we all know, the

      17      barges have gone to Albany, and they've come back

      18      and there has never been a concern.  This is just a

      19      scare tactic.  It's not real.  It's not been

      20      witnessed ever.

      21             Moving to the environmental impact statement,

      22      because I think it's important we discuss this, it's

      23      our position, and I think it's the position of many

      24      others, that there is a need for a comprehensive

      25      environmental impact statement.







                                                                   117
       1             We are not talking a comprehensive

       2      environmental assessment, and we are not talking

       3      about a comprehensive environmental review.  We are

       4      talking about a comprehensive environmental impact

       5      statement.

       6             You've heard others before me talk about the

       7      reasons, the comprehensive nature.  The national

       8      environment policy act which would authorize such a

       9      comprehensive statement requires a comprehensive

      10      look at potentially-significant environmental

      11      impacts before decisions are made.  And that is very

      12      important and it's very meaningful, particularly in

      13      this in case.  And as we've also heard, there is a

      14      problem and it is not a small one.

      15             This review of this expansion of anchorages

      16      is categorically excluded, but we have done work and

      17      we are convinced that there is and are bases that

      18      the substantial impacts we've identified and will

      19      discuss now provide the legal grounds for the Coast

      20      Guard to, in fact, go beyond the exclusion and

      21      prepare what we will ask you tonight and what you've

      22      discussed the need for the full impact statement.

      23      So we ask you and urge you to join us in that

      24      request.

      25             The impacts are many.  We've heard them







                                                                   118
       1      discussed tonight, and I'll summarize them as air,

       2      noise, light pollution, scarring and scouring of the

       3      Hudson River and its related impacts to the fish

       4      that call this place, this river, their home, and

       5      the associated impacts from the reindustrialization

       6      of the river corridor.

       7             This proposal also creates a worst case

       8      scenario.  As I mentioned earlier, it's the oil

       9      spill.  There isn't going to be a response to the

      10      oil spill that's going to recover anything.  It's

      11      just going to happen, and it's going to be over.

      12             Thousands of public comments to date and

      13      dozens of town and elected officials and community

      14      leaders have demonstrated the clear opposition and

      15      concern.

      16             The historical properties' impacts alone are

      17      significant.  As we've heard and we agree, the

      18      Hudson River is American history.  It's clear from

      19      the Battery to the Hudson Highlands, from West Point

      20      to the Erie Canal, it's all right here.

      21             Finally, it's inconsistent with several

      22      environmental laws that the state implements and

      23      that the state has passed.  These include the

      24      state's authority under the endangered species act.

      25      We've heard discussions about the Coastal Zone







                                                                   119
       1      Management Act that empowers local communities up

       2      and down the Hudson River to create a vision for

       3      their communities as the river is restored, for

       4      economic and ecological benefit and future economic

       5      growth, and very importantly, as we've just

       6      mentioned, the National Historic Preservation Act.

       7             Any of these factors alone would be

       8      sufficient to prompt a full environmental review

       9      under the regulations of the Coast Guard.

      10             That this proposal implicates all of them

      11      leads to the clear and undeniable conclusion that it

      12      must undergo full environmental review, but public

      13      support, public pressure, public officials,

      14      concerned community groups and everybody else is

      15      going to be necessary to make that happen.

      16             The public deserves an opportunity to be

      17      heard on all of this.  There needs to be extensive

      18      public hearings up and down the river in all of the

      19      communities impacted.

      20             In conclusion, the proposal to establish new

      21      anchor grounds is being made to the federal

      22      government.  It's a federal action.  We've discussed

      23      this tonight.  But it has tremendous and significant

      24      implications for our state, for our state's future,

      25      and for our community and its residents.







                                                                   120
       1             Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are

       2      relying on their state representatives, to you, to

       3      challenge this proposal, to raise these substantive

       4      and significant issues we've raised and to ensure

       5      that their voices are heard throughout the process.

       6             Riverkeeper at our website Riverkeeper.org

       7      has taken extensive efforts to both identify and

       8      document from both our experience and others the

       9      multitude of issues we found community by community,

      10      resolution by resolution, along this entire valley

      11      and its corridor, and we encourage folks to use

      12      those resources, investigate them and help us

      13      understand better what is necessary to be done with

      14      respect to each individual community.

      15             And in the end, we thank you, and we ask you

      16      and urge you to be part of our voice, all of our

      17      voices, as this proposal seems like it's going to

      18      advance.

      19             So thank you very much.

      20             SENATOR MURPHY:  John, thanks for coming

      21      tonight.  You know, this is the reason why we are

      22      here.  We call this a federal issue.  We are your

      23      state representatives.  I don't see any one federal

      24      representative here tonight.

       1             I don't know where they are, but they should

       2      be here.  So we are pounding the drum on this, and

       3      this is what we are trying do is bring light to it

       4      and get the questions answered.

       5             There is a tremendous amount of questions

       6      that we've had.  We've said it over and over and

       7      over tonight.  Thank you for being here.

       8             This is something that Senator Serino and

       9      Senator Carlucci, who is coming back in right now,

      10      and myself, have been trying to make sure that we

      11      represent the people that put us in these leadership

      12      rolls and these elected position.  That's what we

      13      are supposed to do, and that's why we are doing this

      14      tonight.  And we have been here for what, three

      15      hours now and it's not going to be enough.

      16             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Agreed, and as we

      17      mentioned, this is the beginning.  Advanced notice.

      18             We thank you for your continued support.

      19             SENATOR SERINO:  I believe Congressman

      20      Maloney has the bill against the barges.  He made a

      21      statement.

      22             But thank you very much.

       1      president of the Hudson River Boat and Yacht Club

       2      Association.

       3             Frank, thank you for joining us today.

       4             [ Applause ]

       5             FRANK BERGMAN:  I represent Hudson River Boat

       6      and Yacht Club Association.  And first of all, we

       7      want to thank you for holding this hearing.

       8             Hudson River Boat and Yacht Club Association

       9      represents 31 boat clubs from Poughkeepsie, from

      10      Pirate Canoe Club down to Yonkers Yacht Club, and on

      11      the east shore, Marlboro Yacht Club, and down to

      12      north Jersey on the west shore.

      13             We've got about 3,000 members and in 31 boat

      14      clubs.  We are very concerned, and we're strongly

      15      opposed to the U.S. Coast Guard proposal to put

      16      barge anchorage sites along the Hudson River.

      17             We consider the proposal for these anchorages

      18      seriously flawed.  While the oil companies may

      19      benefit greatly from using the Hudson River as a

      20      parking lot, most others will surely see

      21      overwhelming disadvantages.

      22             The Hudson River and the public are losers.

      23      Let's examine some reasons.  All of the boat clubs

      24      in Hudson River Boat and Yacht Club Association are

      25      opposed to this proposal.  Letters opposing it with







                                                                   123
       1      specific objections have been sent to the Coast

       2      Guard from New Hamburg Yacht Club, Chelsea Yacht

       3      Club, and Minisceongo Yacht Club.

       4             Individual Hudson River Boat and Yacht Club

       5      Association members have also expressed their

       6      concerns.

       7             New Hamburg Yacht Club is especially worried

       8      about water contamination, boater safety, noise, air

       9      and light pollution.

      10             Chelsea Yacht Club is one of the worst

      11      affected.  They're concerned about the dangers posed

      12      by the anchorage in Rosedon interfering with their

      13      mooring fields which New York State authorizes

      14      through a submerged land license.

      15             The proposed anchorage would also obstruct

      16      the racing course and impede the safety of their

      17      boats, essentially fencing them off from the river

      18      at certain times if there are three barges across

      19      there swinging at anchorage.

      20             Minisceongo has many environmental and safety

      21      boater interference concerns.

      22             In addition, our association has received

      23      letters from Peekskill, Mountain and Yonkers Yacht

      24      Clubs expressing similar apprehensions.  Many others

      25      have been vocal at our meetings about how this







                                                                   124
       1      proposal would, without a careful consideration of

       2      the damage that could be done, reverse all the

       3      progress made over the years, over recent years

       4      especially, to have the Hudson River keep its

       5      designation as a National Heritage River.

       6             In addition, from an environmental

       7      standpoint, from the public record, the Hudson River

       8      Estuary Action Agenda published by the

       9      New York State D.E.C. and formulated by the Hudson

      10      River Estuary Management Advisory Committee cites

      11      six major benefits of a strong and vibrant Hudson

      12      River ecosystem.

      13             It strives to achieve those benefits through

      14      action plans.  Those benefits are: clean water,

      15      resilient communities, vital estuary ecosystems,

      16      estuary fish, wildlife and habitats, natural

      17      scenery, education, river access, recreation and

      18      inspiration.

      19             Hudson River Estuary Management Advisory

      20      Committee has worked hard to achieve these goals

      21      over time.  None of them is advanced by this U.S.

      22      Coast Guard proposal, and most of them are negated

      23      or harmed by it.

      24             The consequences could be catastrophic.

      25             For clean water, this proposal would







                                                                   125
       1      seriously open up the risks of spills and pollution.

       2      For resilient communities, it would bring in noise,

       3      light and air pollution.  For vital estuary

       4      ecosystem protection, it would disturb the submerged

       5      aquatic vegetation beds so essential for a balanced

       6      and clean river.

       7             For estuary fish, wildlife and habitats, the

       8      anchorages are in the spawning grounds of Atlantic

       9      sturgeon.  They would scar the river bottom and

      10      destroy underwater vegetation.

      11             For natural scenery, it would turn the river

      12      into a barge parking lot.  For education, river

      13      access, recreation and inspiration, the anchorages

      14      would negate all of the progress that Hudson River

      15      Estuary Management Advisory Committee has achieved

      16      over the years.

      17             These public and public concerns are very

      18      important and deserve thorough consideration.

      19             Again, we urge the U.S. Coast Guard to hold

      20      accessible public hearings, not in New York City and

      21      Albany, but up and down the river communities that

      22      we represent, that they hold them up and down the

      23      river so that they may hear for themselves what this

      24      proposal will do to our magnificent National

      25      Heritage Hudson River.

       1             We also respectfully request that a thorough

       2      environmental review be conducted to ensure that we

       3      do not undo all of the progress made in recent years

       4      to make the Hudson the public asset and jewel it is

       5      today.

       6             Thank you.

       7             [ Applause ]

       8             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  Thank you for being here,

       9      and I really appreciate your advocacy and

      10      particularly when you talk about boater safety.

      11             And I know we've worked together and it was

      12      mentioned working with Assemblywoman Galef to

      13      actually pass a boater safety requirement in

      14      New York State, and we know we've got a long way to

      15      go.  But that's something that I think really hasn't

      16      been talked about too much tonight.  And something

      17      that should be highlighted is that now we did pass

      18      the legislation that we are phasing in, depending

      19      how old you are, who is required to take a basic

      20      boater safety education.

      21             It was mentioned about some of the horrific

      22      accidents we've seen, the tragedies, the life that

      23      has been lost, and we know that that is a direct

      24      correlation to people that just did not have that

      25      basic safety education.







                                                                   127
       1             And so I appreciate you highlighting that,

       2      and I think that's something that as we have more

       3      barges on the river, even though it has been

       4      highlighted in the positive of doing this, that it

       5      could be more safe.  We know that as a recreational

       6      user that it could be a hazard as well.

       7             So I think that's another thing that we have

       8      to highlight and talk about in terms of how this

       9      could be a more dangerous circumstance given the

      10      lack of requirement in terms of who needs that basic

      11      boater safety education on the river, and the people

      12      that have testified that know how unique the Hudson

      13      River is and how education and experience is

      14      something that is extremely important.

      15             FRANK BERGMAN:  Right.

      16             And we really appreciate the efforts that you

      17      and Sandy Galef have worked on for safety and boater

      18      education, and I've spoken at some of your news

      19      conferences about that as well.

      20             SENATOR MURPHY:  Frank, thank you for being

      21      here tonight.  Thank you for coming out of your way.

      22             FRANK BERGMAN:  Thank you very much.

      24             MATT SLATER:  I would like to invite

      25      Emily Majer, who is the Deputy Mayor for the Village







                                                                   128
       1      of Tivoli, all the way up in northern Dutchess

       2      County.

       3             Emily.

       4             [ Applause ]

       5             SENATOR SERINO:  Emily, I want to say thank

       6      you because you have traveled even further than I

       7      have.

       8             EMILY MAJER:  It's an honor to be here.

       9             SENATOR SERINO:  So thank you.  You are the

      10      last one to speak.  Sorry you had to wait so long.

      11             EMILY MAJER:  That's okay.  I'll make it

      12      brief.  Thank you for doing this, and thank you for

      13      the invitation.

      14             The Village of Tivoli adds our collective

      15      voice to the chorus expressing concern over the

      16      request from the Maritime Association of the Port of

      17      New York and New Jersey, the American Waterways

      18      Operators and other industry organizations to

      19      increase the number of federally-designated

      20      anchorages on the Hudson River between Yonkers and

      21      Kingston.

      22             The Maritime Association of the Port of

      23      New York and New Jersey stated in their letter to

      24      the Coast Guard dated January 21, 2016, "Trade will

      25      increase on the Hudson River significantly over the







                                                                   129
       1      next few years with the lifting of the ban on

       2      American crude exports for foreign trade, and

       3      federally-designated anchorages are key to

       4      supporting trade."

       5             The Kingston hub of unofficial anchorages

       6      below -- just south of the Kingston-Rhinecliff

       7      Bridge at Kingston Flats, Port Ewen, and Big Rock

       8      Point, in addition to the existing designated berths

       9      at Hyde Park anticipate this increased trade.

      10             There are certainly conversations to be had

      11      about larger issues, about the environmental costs

      12      of energy independence and how to plan for our

      13      future energy needs.

      14             I'm not qualified to speak to those issues,

      15      but as a resident and representative of Tivoli,

      16      which is just north of a cluster of three proposed

      17      anchorage sites, I can talk about the impact that

      18      increased industrial traffic will have on one tiny

      19      village and the section of river that we call home.

      20             Tivoli was active in maritime trade by the

      21      mid-18th century.  Wharfs and warehouses lined the

      22      shore, but the construction of the railroad

      23      gradually choked out that business, and by the early

      24      20th century, the riverfront was comparatively

      25      quiet, most businesses having moved a mile inland.







                                                                   130
       1             The waterfront, although currently

       2      undeveloped, is well used by fishermen, kayakers,

       3      and people, residents and visitors who come to

       4      admire the Hudson and the views of the Catskills.

       5             Although there are no proposed anchorages

       6      within the Tivoli reach of the Hudson, the traffic

       7      that will be encouraged and enabled by this change

       8      will have immediate and dramatic physical impacts

       9      upon our waterfront.

      10             Within yards of the channel, our shoreline is

      11      eroded by the wake of each tanker ship and barge

      12      that passes.  Consistent with our local waterfront

      13      revitalization plan, the village has engaged the

      14      Department of State, D.E.C., Dutchess County

      15      Planning and Scenic Hudson to stabilize our

      16      shoreline with the goal of creating a public park to

      17      secure access to the water.

      18             Along with this obvious immeasurable impact,

      19      we are concerned about the environmental effects.

      20      Legitimatizing the anchorages south of the

      21      Kingstone-Rhinecliff Bridge, in conjunction with

      22      future increased capacity at the Port of Albany,

      23      could potentially allow an endless, noisy diesel

      24      parade just off our shore.  This would essentially

      25      cut off river access to those recreational boaters







                                                                   131
       1      and fishermen, diminish the quality of life of

       2      residents and visitors, and severely compromise the

       3      public's experience of this scenic area of statewide

       4      significance which is also within the Mid-Hudson

       5      Historic Shoreline Scenic District and the Hudson

       6      Valley Historic Landmark District.

       7             Most worrisome and potentially disastrous is

       8      the effect that this would have on the coves and

       9      tidal marshes of the Tivoli Bay's Wildlife

      10      Management area and the furred, feathered, and

      11      finned inhabitants therein.

      12             The Tivoli Bay's area is 1700 acres of tidal

      13      marsh and upland forest with hiking trails, boat

      14      launches and a bike path connecting the Village of

      15      Tivoli to Bard College.

      16             The bays are a designated New York bird

      17      conservation area in recognition of its unique marsh

      18      bird community.  Its importance as a staging area

      19      for migrating water fowl and migratory stopover

      20      habitat for warblers.

      21             Furthermore, the area is a New York State

      22      Natural Heritage area recognized by the Department

      23      of Environmental Conversation to call attention to

      24      and protect the rare animals, rare plants and

      25      significant natural communities on the state-owned







                                                                   132
       1      land.

       2             The bays are also part of the Hudson River

       3      Estuary and Research Preserve which provide field

       4      laboratories for estuary, research, stewardship and

       5      education by the D.E.C.

       6             This unique and sensitive site is imperilled

       7      by every petroleum product-bearing tanker that

       8      passes by, and increasing the traffic increases the

       9      risk.

      10             We are well aware that accidents or incidents

      11      do occur as evidenced by the running aground of a

      12      dirt-bearing barge on the rocks of Magdalene Island

      13      April 2013.

      14             The impacts and dangers to Tivoli and other

      15      communities, especially the natural resources along

      16      the river that would be courted by allowing more

      17      federally-designated anchorages are undeniable, and

      18      in our estimation, the proposal is unsupportable.

      19             SENATOR SERINO:  Thank you very much, Emily.

      20             [ Applause ]

      21             Thank you, Emily, and you know what has been

      22      the greatest thing about tonight is this concern is

      23      not an R or a D situation.  It is a quality of life.

      24      It would only take one accident because they are

      25      accidents that.  You know, we have people that take







                                                                   133
       1      their drinking water out of the river.  What do we

       2      do?  This is about our children and our

       3      grandchildren having sustainability with our clean

       4      water because our river is getting cleaner.  I water

       5      skied in that river for many years.

       6             I thank you very much for traveling and for

       7      everyone that has come tonight and stayed tonight

       8      through the whole session.  So thank you very much.

       9             SENATOR MURPHY:  Emily, thank you.

      11             MATT SLATER:  We have one last speaker not on

      12      the agenda tonight, Jerry -- I'm going to botch your

      13      name -- Faiella, from Hudson River Historic River

      14      Towns.

      15             JERRY FAIELLA:  Thank you very much.

      16      I appreciate the ability to put a comment on the

      17      record.

      18             Senators Murphy, Carlucci, and Serino, thank

      19      you for putting organizing this event, and I

      20      apologize for not pre-registering.  I appreciate the

      21      opportunity to speak.

      22             I'm Jerry Faiella, the Executive Director of

      23      Historic Hudson River Towns.  HHRT, we are a

      24      not-for-profit organization formed in 1984, and we

      25      are one of the intermunicipal organizations to help







                                                                   134
       1      the Hudson Valley riverfront communities build

       2      tourism, marketing, revitalization and downtown

       3      renewal.

       4             We are very active with Hudson Valley

       5      Greenway, and we also have a seat on the Hudson

       6      River Estuary Management Advisory Committee, the

       7      D.E.C., something that Frank Bergman mentioned.

       8             We are very committed to the region both for

       9      tourism and to the protection of the Hudson River.

      10      Our membership consists of 20 local jurisdictions on

      11      the lower Hudson Valley, both sides of the river

      12      from Yonkers to Beacon and from Nyack to Newburgh,

      13      and we have been working closely with the City of

      14      Yonkers and Riverkeeper on this endeavor.

      15             I'm talking fast because the hour is late.  I

      16      appreciate the time.

      17             The direct impacts of the designated

      18      anchorage areas vary from community to community,

      19      and it is not HHRT's position to simply move the

      20      issue from one riverfront community to another.  We

      21      think a reasonable solution needs to be developed

      22      that protects the community's waterfront which many

      23      communities consider now as their front door,

      24      something that is environmental sound and

      25      esthetically acceptable.







                                                                   135
       1             As such, the Coast Guard should recognize the

       2      need for an E.I.S. which you've heard tonight

       3      already, because this proposal should not be

       4      included in an categorical exemption normally

       5      bestowed upon the placement of anchorages.

       6             You heard from Deb Malone tonight that

       7      tourism is a $4.7 billion industry in the region

       8      that employs 81,000 people.  We should not lose

       9      sight of that as an economic driver when people talk

      10      about this as an economic driver.

      11             Our fears rest with the underlying intention

      12      that has not been stated up front, but is clearly

      13      evident when you start to read between the lines of

      14      the letters that have been submitted in support of

      15      this proposal.  And it comes from the Pilot's

      16      Association letter where they talk about this as

      17      supply chain management.

      18             So when you think about supply chain

      19      management, you have to conclude that we are talking

      20      about the movement of 2.8 billion gallons of bakken

      21      crude oil through the Port of Albany a year.  And

      22      most of this is not for domestic refineries since

      23      the Linden plant is at 85% capacity, but is

      24      predominantly targeted for foreign consumption now

      25      that the federal ban has been lifted.







                                                                   136
       1             We believe these anchorage locations will

       2      grow into floating storage facilities that will

       3      impede the growth of the tourism industry throughout

       4      the valley.

       5             So HHRT, we have engaged the firm of

       6      Blanchard and Wilson to see what our legal rights

       7      are or for what the legal rights are for the

       8      jurisdictions in this proposal so we can have an

       9      impact on the outcome.

      10             Now you've heard about the federal Coastal

      11      Zone Management Program.  What that does is it

      12      provides local jurisdictions empowered through the

      13      New York State Department of State to adopt local

      14      waterfront revitalization plans, and these plans,

      15      once adopted, and approved by the New York

      16      Department of State and the federal government,

      17      requires all parties, governmental and private, that

      18      are putting forth an action, to be consistent, and

      19      we stress the word consistent -- you've heard that

      20      here tonight -- with the plan.

      21             In addition, New York State law provides

      22      local jurisdictions with the authority to legislate

      23      land use issues and develop local zoning which you

      24      are all familiar with.  The adoption of a

      25      comprehensive master plan gives the local







                                                                   137
       1      jurisdictions considerable authority in determining

       2      their overall development strategy.

       3             We think understanding these two principles,

       4      which I think Ned Sullivan talked about, HRRT is

       5      developing for its member community a draft

       6      resolution that will initiative a systematic review

       7      of their LWRP and comprehensive land use plans, to

       8      incorporate the importance of maintaining river

       9      access to the navigable channel for commercial

      10      tourism use, address coastal uses within and

      11      immediately beyond their boundaries so as to not

      12      negatively impact passive recreational use of the

      13      waterfront, and to preserve the esthetic water

      14      quality for mixed-use development and protect the

      15      environmental features of the Hudson River and its

      16      estuaries to maintain a balanced ecosystem for

      17      water-related recreational use.

      18             We think it's going to be imperative for the

      19      communities to move in that direction because that's

      20      going to give them standing here in this case.

      21             We think it's imperative for the Coast Guard

      22      anchorage program to prove that it is consistent

      23      with the goals stated in these LWRPs and local land

      24      use comprehensive plans and use that as the

      25      objective to force the need for review that we are







                                                                   138
       1      talking about tonight.

       2             Some argue that the rule making is exempt,

       3      but we think that, we believe that in this instance

       4      because consistency with the CZM, federal

       5      regulations will justify the preparation of an E.I.S

       6      and really address the potential impacts.

       7             Without further knowledge of the actual terms

       8      and conditions of the rule making, it is difficult

       9      to further comment, but at this particular point in

      10      time, we are taking the position that we really want

      11      to see the E.I.S. developed.

      12             Thank you very much for your time.

      13      Appreciate it.

      15             SENATOR MURPHY:  I believe that was our last

      16      speaker for the evening.

      17             Senator Serino, do you want to say any

      18      closing words, then I'll go to Senator Carlucci.

      19             SENATOR SERINO:  I just want to say thank

      20      you.  And I also believe -- I don't know if anyone

      21      is here from the Women's Council of Realtors or the

      22      Dutchess County Association of Realtors because they

      23      both came out in opposition.

      24             I am a realtor myself in opposition of the

      25      barges, and thank you once again everyone for being







                                                                   139
       1      here this evening.  Thank you.

       2             SENATOR MURPHY:  Senator Carlucci.

       3             SENATOR CARLUCCI:  I want to thank Senator

       4      Murphy and Senator Serino for being here and

       5      everyone that has testified and everyone that is

       6      here.

       7             We've heard the reasons why this is so

       8      important.  I also wanted to mention Councilwoman

       9      Elizabeth Feldman is here from Ossining who I forgot

      10      to announce earlier.  Thank you.  You have been here

      11      since the beginning and sat all the way through.  We

      12      know you think this is very important.

      13             And Jerry who spoke.  We talked about

      14      tourism.  One of the things we are working on and we

      15      believe is a reality is building a museum at

      16      Sing-Sing. And we talk about how, Jerry talked about

      17      that the river is the front door to many of the

      18      communities along the Hudson River, and it's

      19      something that we have to protect dearly.  And we've

      20      heard so many great and enlightening words being

      21      spoken tonight.  And the fact that we've got to make

      22      sure we don't tread lightly, that we leave no stone

      23      unturned, that we dot our Is and cross our Ts

      24      because if we learn anything from history, it's the

      25      mistake of past generations.  And we can't allow







                                                                   140
       1      that mistake to happen again.

       2             So I appreciate everyone, no matter what side

       3      of the issue you are on.  All of us have to work

       4      together to make sure that we protect the integrity

       5      of the river and protect the quality of life of the

       6      residents living among the river.

       7             So I look forward to working with all of you,

       8      everyone in this room and beyond, to make sure that

       9      the best decisions are being made for us currently

      10      and for future generations.

      11             So thank you so much for being here.  I look

      12      forward to working with everyone in the future.

      13      Thank you.

      15             SENATOR MURPHY:  I would just like to thank

      16      Mayor Schmidt.  I'm not sure if he is still here,

      17      but he is the one who opened up his doors to allow

      18      us all to be here tonight.

      19             And to the residents hanging in there with us

      20      for close to four hours, for being here tonight on

      21      this incredible, incredibly important topic.

      22             To the 14 people who testified tonight.

      23             And to Ed Cook for actually coming up and

      24      giving us a few answers.  Ed, I know you traveled...

      25      you're a trooper.  Thank you for coming up and







                                                                   141
       1      answering some of our questions.  We truly

       2      appreciate it.

       3             There is going to be much, much more, but

       4      this is a start in the right direction to figure out

       5      what we have to do.

       6             The Hudson River is one of the most majestic

       7      places, I believe, in not only New York State but in

       8      the United States.  Look at the foliage that is

       9      going on the foliage.  It is absolutely beautiful.

      10      I'll put it up against anybody and any place in the

      11      United States.

      12             Some of the stuff that we've talked about

      13      tonight, these LWRPs, these local waterfront

      14      revitalization plans, and these are important

      15      designations to our community and to the waterfront

      16      areas.

      17             I personally over the past two years have

      18      passed 14 bills to designate some of our lakes and

      19      some of our estuaries to make sure that we can keep

      20      these places the beautiful little lakes and

      21      estuaries that they are.

      22             This are stuff that Senator Serino said,

      23      there is no D on this.  There is no R on this.

      24      There is no I on this.  There is no C on this.  This

      25      is the right thing to do for our environment, for







                                                                   142
       1      our kids, and for our future.  And these are the

       2      reasons why we are having -- and we are going to

       3      continue beating the drum of having these public

       4      hearings.  I'm not going to wait for the Coast Guard

       5      to show up, because they didn't.

       6             [ Applause ]

       7             They were invited.  They were invited here

       8      and no one had the courtesy to show up on an

       9      important event, knowing that these anchorage sites

      10      that they're proposing, they won't even come and

      11      give us answers about.  To me that's is graceful,

      12      and I -- don't get me wrong -- I hold them in high

      13      regard.  They do wonderful work.  And like

      14      Mr. Cronin said, there is the rank and file and

      15      then there is the administration, and the

      16      administration is again, like I said before, put the

      17      federal government in it and they can screw up

      18      anything.  Okay.

      19             So I thank you all for being patient here

      20      tonight.  I thank you for participating, for the

      21      people who testified, for Senator Carlucci coming

      22      across from Rockland County.  Thank you.  It's

      23      always great working with you.  For Senator Serino

      24      coming down from Dutchess County, and my colleagues,

      25      I appreciate the support here.  This is something







                                                                   143
       1      that is vital to all of us.

       2             Between the three of us, we represent close

       3      to a million people, and your voices are going to be

       4      heard through us.  I can promise you that.

       5             Thank you, and good night.
