 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      If people could

 2   take their seats.

 3         Good morning.    I am Helene Weinstein,

 4   chair of the New York State Assembly Ways and

 5   Means Committee and cochair of today's

 6   hearing.

 7         Today we begin the sixth in a series

 8   of hearings conducted by the joint fiscal

 9   committees of the Legislature regarding the

10   Governor's proposed budget for fiscal year

11   2020-2021.    The hearings are conducted

12   pursuant to the New York State

13   Constitution and the Legislative Law.

14         Today the Assembly Ways and Means

15   Committee and the Senate Finance Committee

16   will hear testimony concerning the Governor's

17   budget proposal for higher education.

18         I'll introduce members of the Assembly

19   majority, and Senator Krueger, chair of

20   Senate Finance, will introduce members from

21   the Senate.

22         So we have with us our chair of the

23   Higher Education Committee, Deborah Glick;

24   Assemblyman Pichardo, Assemblyman Epstein,
                                                     7

 1   Assemblyman Stirpe, and Assemblywoman Fahy.

 2         Senator Krueger?

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Good morning.

 4   Thank you, everyone.

 5         I'm joined by the chair of Higher Ed,

 6   Toby Stavisky; the ranker on Higher Ed,

 7   John {sic} LaValle; the ranker on Finance,

 8   Jim Seward; Senator Andrew Gounardes; and

 9   Senator Anna Kaplan.   And I know I saw

10   Senator Liu, but I think he's disappeared and

11   will come back.

12         Thank you.    Oh, I'm sorry, Ken

13   LaValle, how -- excuse me, Ken.

14         SENATOR LaVALLE:    That's all right.

15         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Nobody will

16   forget, Senator.

17         So before introducing the first

18   witness, a couple of ground rules for all of

19   the hearings that we've gone through at the

20   beginning.   We have these countdown clocks,

21   both for the witnesses and for the members to

22   pay attention to.   There will be a green

23   light when your time starts.    When there's

24   one minute left, the light turns -- as the
                                                         8

 1   clock goes down to one minute, the light

 2   turns yellow.   And when it's red, it means

 3   thank you and goodbye.

 4           (Laughter.)

 5           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    No.   But you

 6   can always finish your last sentence, please.

 7           And witnesses, particularly those

 8   nongovernmental witnesses, are reminded that

 9   we do have your testimony, which was

10   submitted electronically in advance, it's

11   been circulated to all the members.     So we

12   encourage you to not read your testimony, but

13   summarize.

14           A lot of people think they can get

15   through several pages in five minutes.      We're

16   here to tell you you can't.     And if you have

17   your important point at the end of your

18   testimony, you'll never get to it.      So make

19   sure to highlight your important parts.

20           And to the members, just timing,

21   chairs of the relevant committee have

22   10 minutes.   They are the only ones allowed a

23   follow-up of five minutes after everyone has

24   gone.   All other members have five minutes.
                                                       9

 1   And when we get to the nongovernmental

 2   witnesses, the members have three minutes.

 3   And the time is for both questions and

 4   answers.

 5           So now I'll introduce our ranker,

 6   Assemblyman Ra, to introduce his Republican

 7   colleagues.

 8           ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Thank you.

 9           We're joined this morning by

10   Assemblyman Doug Smith, our ranking member on

11   the Higher Education Committee, and

12   Assemblyman Jake Ashby.

13           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   So with that,

14   we are anxious to begin our hearing.    And our

15   first witness, Kristina Johnson, chancellor,

16   State University of New York.    Please.

17           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Thank you.

18           Good morning.   It's a pleasure to be

19   here.   And I'd like to start off by saying

20   that I will keep to the time.

21           And I'd also like to thank you for all

22   your support that you've provided, both the

23   Governor and the Legislature.    I really feel

24   SUNY has tremendous momentum.    And so what
                                                     10

 1   I'd like to do today is, for the record, I am

 2   Kristina Johnson, the 13th chancellor of the

 3   State University of New York.   And I'd like

 4   to personally thank Chairpersons Krueger,

 5   Weinstein, Stavisky and Glick, members of the

 6   Senate and Assembly and legislative staff,

 7   for the opportunity to share with you our

 8   perspective on Governor Cuomo's proposed

 9   Executive Budget, the progress we've made

10   since last year's hearing, and our plans for

11   the future.

12         I'd also like to acknowledge and thank

13   Chairman of the Board Dr. Meryl Tisch and our

14   entire Board of Trustees for their leadership

15   and support, and particularly our student

16   trustee -- who's president of the Student

17   Assembly of the 1.4 million students in the

18   State University of New York -- and that is

19   Austin Ostro, who is here today as well; my

20   leadership team, who is seated behind me; and

21   of course all of the people that keep our

22   system moving forward -- the students, the

23   faculty, staff and our leadership teams

24   across the system.
                                                     11

 1         Last fall I had the pleasure of

 2   finalizing visits to every single one of the

 3   SUNY institutions, all 64, and really got a

 4   chance to see the size, the scope, the

 5   breadth and the diversity of the quality that

 6   goes into the 30 community colleges, the

 7   29 state-operated colleges, the five

 8   statutory, the law school, the medical

 9   schools, the hospitals -- even the national

10   laboratory.

11         We are involved in all kinds of

12   activities, ranging from scholarship research

13   to workforce development, carrying out the

14   Governor's robust initiative.   We deliver

15   320,000 non-credit-bearing courses to our

16   community college students.   That's in

17   addition to the couple of hundred thousand

18   community college students that are enrolled,

19   and the couple of hundred thousand enrolled

20   in our four-year institutions as well.

21         Now, I'm an engineer by training, so

22   for me it comes down to data.   And what I'd

23   like to do is try and put a few words with

24   some of those numbers to show you some of the
                                                         12

 1   progress we've made and the impact that we're

 2   having on the State of New York.

 3         So the first thing is social mobility.

 4   Almost a third of our students have TAP or an

 5   Excelsior scholarship.   Think about that.      A

 6   third of our students, more than half go

 7   tuition-free.   And that's measured by a

 8   social mobility index where 18 out of 29 of

 9   our state-operated campuses rank in the top

10   10 percent nationally for taking large

11   numbers of low-income students and graduating

12   them into high-paying jobs.

13         In fact, on PayScale's recent index,

14   Maritime College ranked 11th in the entire

15   country, including all the Ivys, for the kind

16   of careers that those students get right out

17   of college and then again their salaries at

18   mid-career.   So SUNY is certainly a gem in

19   the constellation of the State of New York.

20         SUNY is known for the quality of

21   education we provide and of course the sheer

22   size of the largest comprehensive system of

23   higher education in the country.   And it is a

24   game-changer for New York's economy.     When
                                                       13

 1   you think about it, almost a third --

 2   actually, a little more than a third of every

 3   college-educated individual in the State of

 4   New York has a SUNY degree.

 5            This year we received 371,000

 6   applications, and we have roughly 3 million

 7   alums.    And three out of four of our alums,

 8   within three to five years of their

 9   graduation, are still working and

10   contributing to the State of New York.

11            SUNY hospitals are the heartbeat of

12   the local healthcare in the underserved

13   communities they call home.    They're also the

14   economic engines of Brooklyn, Central

15   New York, Long Island, Buffalo -- including

16   the hospital of Buffalo, of course.

17            Each SUNY hospital serves higher

18   percentages of people covered by Medicaid and

19   Medicare than the general population seen at

20   other hospitals.    Collectively they serve

21   1.2 million individual patients and 2 million

22   visits a year.    They contribute $6 billion to

23   their local economy.    And in fact, Downstate

24   Health Sciences University -- we just changed
                                                      14

 1   the name from Downstate Medical Center to

 2   Downstate Health Sciences University --

 3   they're number two in START-UP NY, with

 4   24 spin-off companies in the Governor's

 5   START-UP NY program.

 6         So yes, we do serve those that don't

 7   have another option for healthcare.   We're

 8   also driving the local economy in these

 9   communities.

10         Our community colleges are critically

11   important to providing the State of New York

12   an educated workforce for our dynamic

13   economy.   For many, it's the first stop to

14   realizing their dreams and aspirations for

15   social mobility.   We look forward to working

16   with the Governor and the Legislature

17   throughout this budget process to restore the

18   community college funding floor that you

19   included in last year's budget, and I thank

20   you for that.

21         SUNY's Educational Opportunity

22   Programs are life-changing as well.   I didn't

23   realize this, but the Educational Opportunity

24   Programs, the average income of the families
                                                         15

 1   these students come from is $21,000.      At our

 2   Educational Opportunity Centers, the average

 3   income for those students that come from

 4   families making less than $15,000 a year.      If

 5   you want to talk about how you get into the

 6   middle class in this country, you do it

 7   through SUNY.   And we're doing it through our

 8   EOCs, our EOPs, our community colleges, our

 9   tech sector, our comprehensives and our

10   doctoral institutions.   So I'm so proud of

11   it.

12         Today we've got 10,274 students within

13   48 campus-based programs in our EOP programs.

14   And we've had about 75,000 students over the

15   52- or 53-year horizon of the EOP program.

16   And this last fall, we started the Norman

17   McConney Award for outstanding EOP students.

18   And I want to tell you about one of these

19   students.   This is a student that's at

20   Dutchess Community College -- I will not

21   mention the name -- but she is a mother of

22   five, with students with special needs, and

23   she had a 4.0 full-time community college

24   grade point average.   I never had a 4.0 grade
                                                       16

 1   point average.   This is stunning.

 2         But those are the kind of students

 3   that EOP attracts.    I couldn't be prouder of

 4   her and every one of those 42 students that

 5   we honored.   And the Speaker also was there

 6   to recognize them.

 7         Results from two years of the

 8   Excelsior Scholarship Program.    I want to say

 9   that enrollments are increased 20 percent.

10   We had 20,000 SUNY and CUNY students in the

11   first year and increased to 24,000.

12         Let's look at the results.     Our

13   community college first-year retention rates

14   went up 20 percent.    And they're also up in

15   our state-operated.    That means the program

16   is working as designed, which is to get more

17   students out faster with less debt.   And they

18   do have less debt.    We're excited about

19   increasing the cap on family income

20   eligibility to 150,000.

21         So I said I'd talk about some of our

22   results from last year.    With your support of

23   our Open Educational Resources, since the

24   fall of 2017 we have reduced textbook costs
                                                       17

 1   to our students a cumulative $47 million.    As

 2   a result of the Provost Innovation Fund, we

 3   have re-enrolled 8,000 students who dropped

 4   out before their loans became due.   So they

 5   have the best opportunity to repay those

 6   loans because they will have a degree which

 7   will garner them a higher wage.

 8         And with rising rates of anxiety,

 9   depression and suicide among our young adults

10   nationwide, we launched the SUNY Mental

11   Health and Wellness Task Force this last

12   fall, chaired by two of our presidents,

13   Dr. Wayne Riley of Downstate and Dr. Deborah

14   Stanley at Oswego.

15         I know you know this; we did

16   establish, under Governor Cuomo's leadership,

17   a Food Insecurity Task Force in 2018 which

18   resulted in, over the last year, having

19   students having access to food pantries who

20   are food-insecure at every single one of our

21   campuses.

22         In all, about 150,000 students are

23   impacted by one of our SUNY Achieve programs,

24   which is to get students into credit-bearing
                                                         18

 1   courses faster.    And that's our corequisite

 2   model.    We've been able to get students to

 3   pass basic math and English, a barrier to

 4   completion, in half the time -- twice as

 5   fast.

 6            And speaking of half the time and

 7   twice as fast, I have a minute 23 seconds

 8   left, so I'm going to skip to just a couple

 9   of quick accomplishments.

10            One of the pillars of my

11   chancellorship is not only individualized

12   education, which is our SUNY Achieve,

13   SUNY Online -- which I can talk about in a

14   minute -- it's research and innovation.      This

15   last year SUNY, partnering with Empire State

16   Development, brought $5 billion to the State

17   of New York, working in partnership with IBM,

18   Applied Materials and Cree.    We've increased

19   our research expenditures $136 million.      We

20   will reach, we believe, in 2019 more than

21   $1.7 billion.    I set a goal, when I first

22   became chancellor two and a half years ago,

23   of reaching $2 billion.

24            And then with 42 seconds left, just
                                                      19

 1   let me conclude that we're excited about the

 2   SUNY Global Cannabis Center in the Governor's

 3   budget.     We are excited about the Education

 4   Opportunity Programs, the EOCs and the

 5   Attains.

 6         And we ask that you consider restoring

 7   the community college funding floor,

 8   restoring the childcare at community

 9   colleges, our Mental Health Tele-Counseling,

10   the Small Business Development Centers work,

11   our graduate diversity fellowships, and

12   support for all our graduate students, the

13   Hispanic Leadership Institute, and continue

14   support for our hospitals.

15         I would like to thank you for inviting

16   me here to testify, and with that I will

17   conclude.

18         (Timeclock chiming.)

19         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Perfect.

20         (Laughter.)

21         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Let that be a

22   lesson to all here.

23         We've been joined by Assemblywoman

24   Seawright.
                                                      20

 1           And we go to our Higher Education

 2   chair, Deborah Glick, for some questions.

 3           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    We've also been

 4   joined by Robert Jackson in the Senate.

 5           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you very

 6   much.

 7           Chancellor, appreciate your testimony.

 8           The budget -- the Executive Budget

 9   calls for regular annual increases in

10   tuition, authorizing regular annual increases

11   of $200 per year through the year of

12   2024-2025.

13           If we agree to that, what does the

14   final tuition wind up being?    And with that

15   escalation, what would be the impact on the

16   TAP gap that the university is already

17   struggling with?   As we increase tuition, we

18   increase the TAP gap.   And so that seems like

19   it is almost ice in winter.

20           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Thank you very

21   much for your question.

22           So an increase of $200 per year for

23   the next four years would be $800, on top --

24   at our state-operated institutions, the
                                                        21

 1   tuition right now is $7070, so that would be

 2   $7870.

 3            The TAP gap right now is $1905.     So

 4   adding 800 to that, that would be 2700 for

 5   the TAP gap.    Right now the cumulative TAP

 6   gap -- we have about 100,000 students

 7   getting -- mostly full-time students getting

 8   TAP support.    It's about 82 million.   So this

 9   would increase -- that's the TAP gap, the gap

10   between what our campuses need to educate a

11   student and what the tuition pays.

12            So it would be, just bottom line,

13   $2700.    It would increase the TAP gap unless

14   we got some sort of relief.

15            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   I'm sorry, what

16   was that?

17            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Unless we got

18   some sort of relief, it would be $2705.

19            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   And you already

20   have some built-up TAP gap on the books.

21   What is that at the --

22            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    That's $1905 at

23   the state-operated.    I want to be clear, at

24   the state-operated, where the tuition is 7070
                                                         22

 1   and the TAP support is 5165.    So the

 2   difference is every student on TAP has a gap

 3   that the campuses need to pay.

 4         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     We know what

 5   that is, it would be -- rather than by

 6   student, what is the current burden?

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Eighty-two

 8   million.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Eighty-two

10   million, thank you.

11         And you indicated that you have 10,294

12   EOP students.

13         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Right.

14         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Those students

15   come from families with an average of $21,000

16   in family income.   How many applications do

17   you get for those spots that you obviously

18   don't have room for?

19         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Right.   So we get

20   12,000 applications a year, and we have room

21   for 4,000 students.

22         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Okay.    Now, the

23   Governor is proposing to expand Excelsior,

24   which is viewed as a completion program.      I
                                                        23

 1   think TAP is viewed as a completion program

 2   too, since it's only available for eight

 3   semesters.   From my perspective, it's a

 4   completion program.   Even though you can be

 5   viewed as full-time even if you're carrying

 6   12 credits, you wind up on your own if you

 7   don't graduate on time.   So -- which of

 8   course I didn't, so -- not that I was

 9   eligible for TAP, but ...

10         The Governor's proposal for increasing

11   Excelsior to $150,000 of household income --

12   and that tuition would be frozen.    So the

13   system gets a student in, and their tuition

14   stays the same for the four years.    Other

15   students, who for whatever reason -- work or

16   whatever -- can't carry 30 credits a year,

17   they pay an extra $200 in tuition.

18         And the difference between those

19   students -- now, the students who are in EOP,

20   they generally graduate at the same or better

21   rate than students who come in without.     What

22   is that graduation rate, do you know offhand?

23         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    I do.   It's

24   actually higher.   I will get the exact
                                                     24

 1   number, but it's roughly -- I want to say

 2   78 percent for the state-operated, compared

 3   to 71 percent.   But I'll make sure you get

 4   the right -- the exact numbers.

 5           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   I appreciate

 6   that.

 7           So we have a fairly high completion

 8   rate from families that are making $21,000,

 9   with the additional supports that they get.

10   And now we're suggesting that students who

11   are kind of in the middle get tuition

12   increases, but not the families that are up

13   to $125,000, $150,000.   Does that seem that

14   there may be a better use of those resources?

15           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So I think the

16   opportunity to increase the aid to all

17   students attending SUNY would be welcome.

18   And there's many different ways, as you

19   mentioned, that we do that -- with EOP, with

20   TAP, with the PTS program, with Excelsior.

21   And now expanding Excelsior will allow more

22   students to go with less debt.

23           We would be grateful for any increase

24   in EOP and some of the other support programs
                                                          25

 1   as well.

 2           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you.

 3           The Governor has repeated his -- the

 4   critical maintenance piece from last year.

 5   At this point, what's the -- that's

 6   $550 million.   Do you have a backlog in

 7   critical maintenance across the system?       And

 8   will the 550 actually meet the need?

 9           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    We do have a

10   backlog.   The 550 is part of a five-year

11   plan.   So that's very helpful, and we're very

12   appreciative to the Governor and the

13   Legislature for giving us a multiyear

14   critical maintenance plan.

15           We estimate that probably to take care

16   of the backlog in a timely manner for our

17   roughly 850 state-owned-and-operated

18   buildings that we take care of, we probably

19   need a few hundred million more per year.       So

20   we are looking for something in the 750 to

21   850 range.

22           What we're very excited about is the

23   opportunity to have appropriations for new

24   construction, because several of our
                                                      26

 1   campuses are bursting at the seams for the

 2   high-demand sort of STEAM and STEM programs.

 3   So we're very thrilled about the opportunity

 4   to have new construction.

 5         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   And speaking of

 6   the new capital, it seems to be somewhat of a

 7   matching program.   How do you envision being

 8   able to make full use of the dollars that are

 9   available if there is in fact a match

10   required?   What's been the record for SUNY

11   being able to attract those capital dollars?

12         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So there's

13   several different ways that we could come up

14   with the match.   So I know you all know this:

15   It's 300 million, 200 million from the state

16   and 100 million from the individual campuses.

17   Now, that could be in the form of

18   philanthropy dollars, it can be in the form

19   of reserves, it can be in the form of

20   dollars, we believe, supplied by some of the

21   auxiliary operations.   So -- as well as

22   savings.

23         We have launched, in anticipation of

24   being able to develop those sort of resources
                                                         27

 1   through efficiencies, for example, a print

 2   initiative, a print conservation.     We believe

 3   we can take 25 million out of the costs,

 4   across SUNY, of printer and paper and toners

 5   from printing.    And so we're really going to

 6   push this electronic initiative.     I believe

 7   we'll be as successful as we were with the

 8   Open Education Resources, where we are saving

 9   our students 47 million.

10            So I think it's a combination of

11   efficiencies, philanthropy, reserves, and

12   other resources from our campuses to come up

13   with that particular match.

14            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   In view of the

15   fact that 40 percent of the state buildings

16   are in fact SUNY buildings, how much need is

17   there?    So if we're looking at you having to

18   come up with 100 million and this year

19   300 million would be available, what is the

20   real need?

21            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So I think it's a

22   two-part answer, if I may.

23            One is there's a need every year for

24   about 300 million of new construction.      The
                                                         28

 1   important thing is to be able to plan over a

 2   larger horizon.    So we'd be very excited

 3   about, just like the critical maintenance,

 4   having a multiyear of the -- 550 a year for

 5   five years, is to be able to have the

 6   300 million per year for five years would be

 7   a billion from the state and we'd be raising

 8   a third of that on top of it.

 9            So it's two things.     One is we

10   probably need about a billion dollars over

11   five years from the state, and we need to

12   match that with about 330 million.

13            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you.

14            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thank you.

15            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Before we go to

16   the Senate, I just wanted to acknowledge

17   we've been joined by Assemblywoman Lifton,

18   Assemblywoman Buttenschon, and Assemblywoman

19   Simon.

20            Now to the Senate.

21            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22            The chair of Higher Ed, Toby Stavisky.

23            SENATOR STAVISKY:    Thank you.

24            Thank you, Chancellor, for your
                                                      29

 1   service.   We certainly appreciate your

 2   enthusiasm and dedication and background.

 3   It's I think going to be a great relationship

 4   between you -- I know you've been here

 5   several years, but it's I think going to be a

 6   positive relationship.

 7           Let me ask you a couple of questions.

 8   You spoke about the various programs.     What

 9   is the university spending on remediation for

10   those students who are not able to provide

11   the necessary background for admission?

12           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So we've really

13   put a lot of effort into helping get students

14   ready for college.   And give me just a minute

15   to explain what I mean by that.

16           If you go back to 2014-2015, there was

17   about 77,000 of our students -- so think

18   about that, on a base of roughly 450,000 at

19   that time -- 77,000, almost 80, out of 450

20   that required some sort of remediation.    And

21   at that time the way we determined that was

22   the students would come in and they'd take an

23   exam.   And based on that one piece of

24   information we'd put folks into --
                                                       30

 1   individuals into our remediation math or

 2   remediation English.

 3         And as I said in my State of the

 4   University System, how more discouraging can

 5   that be than to have to go back and repeat?

 6   And it's not credit-bearing.

 7         So working with the leadership of

 8   Johanna Duncan-Poitier, who's here, and the

 9   campus presidents, and the coalition of the

10   willing, we have grown a corequisite English

11   and a math.   So we've changed the way we look

12   at this.   We say, okay, in English you're

13   going to go into a credit-bearing course but

14   we're going to provide non-credit-bearing,

15   another unit of non-credit-bearing but help

16   with preparing for English.

17         And here's what we found.     This is

18   really fascinating.    It turns out that if you

19   set the expectation that you will be able to

20   pass a credit-bearing course and you provide

21   the resources, we're finding that those

22   students actually pass that class faster and

23   on the first try.

24         So today, instead of 77,000 students
                                                        31

 1   going into remediation, we have less than

 2   40,000 students.   I think last year it was

 3   44,000, now we're down to 39,000.      I believe

 4   there will come a time when that is something

 5   that is -- we'll either figure out something

 6   even better to do than the corequisite model

 7   that's working, or that model will take care

 8   of the math and the English.

 9         Now, you can do an estimate -- and I

10   tried to do an estimate just now kind of off

11   the top of my head -- what that means if

12   you're providing that extra instructional

13   support.   So if you'd allow me to not give

14   you a number now off the top of my head, but

15   we'll come back with you, we'll get together

16   with the team and noodle out what that is

17   costing us.

18         SENATOR STAVISKY:   That was my -- the

19   second part of the question, obviously, was

20   the price tag.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Yeah.

22         SENATOR STAVISKY:   I know it's

23   preferable to have classes taught by

24   full-time experienced faculty.    But
                                                           32

 1   unfortunately, colleges have to rely on

 2   part-time or adjunct faculty.

 3         Can you tell us the percentage of

 4   adjuncts who are teaching, let's say at the

 5   four year colleges?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Yup.    Yes.   So if

 7   I could start with the top-line number and

 8   then I'll disaggregate the data.

 9         So it's 50.6 percent of our faculty

10   are adjuncts.   That's up.    If you look at the

11   four-years, the comprehensives and the tech,

12   it's almost 50 percent exactly.       It's like

13   49.6 percent.   If you look at the doctoral

14   and the community colleges, they're almost

15   flipped.   What do I mean by that?      The

16   doctoral are basically 71.5 percent -- just

17   call it 70 percent for round numbers --

18   full-time, 30 percent adjunct.     Community

19   colleges are just flipped, they're 30 percent

20   full-time, 70 percent adjunct.

21         SENATOR STAVISKY:      And what about the

22   community colleges?

23         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      And that's the

24   community colleges, I'm sorry, 30 percent
                                                        33

 1   full-time and 70 percent part-time.

 2            That's interesting, right?   I mean,

 3   it's ...

 4            SENATOR STAVISKY:   About a year ago an

 5   article appeared in the Times Union

 6   discussing the question of the Confucius

 7   Institute at the University at Albany.     And

 8   at the time the article -- the reporter had

 9   called me, it was Rick Karlin, and I said

10   we've got to check into the situation.

11            And then Sunday the Daily News had an

12   op-ed by a SUNY professor outlining the

13   dangers -- and I thought it was a fairly

14   balanced article.    It presented the arguments

15   both for and against the Confucius Institute.

16   And in fairness, this is a nationwide program

17   by the government of the People's Republic of

18   China.    It's been -- I happen to support, as

19   you know, international programs, and I think

20   they are excellent.

21            But could you explain or respond to

22   some of the questions concerning academic

23   freedom, First Amendment, and all of the

24   other issues that have been raised?
                                                         34

 1            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Certainly.

 2            So this is something that I started

 3   looking into when I first became chancellor.

 4   And I looked into it for several reasons.       I

 5   think one of the reasons it's coming up now

 6   is the concern, as you mentioned, about

 7   academic freedom, transparency, and being

 8   open about what's going on where.    All very

 9   valid and very important.

10            At the same time I was asked to go to

11   Washington to join in classified briefings --

12   of which I will not, obviously, divulge any

13   of the briefing -- but with senators, and to

14   learn about what their concerns are.        And I

15   also made some recommendations in the general

16   area of intellectual property protection.

17            So this is something that we have been

18   thinking about and working on for a couple of

19   years.    Turns out we have six Confucius

20   Institutes.    Some of the information in the

21   article wasn't accurate, we'll correct that.

22   There is no longer a Confucius Institute at

23   SUNY Global, but that is being -- pending a

24   move to Nassau Community College.    So there
                                                      35

 1   are still six.

 2         We are reviewing each one of the

 3   contracts.    We want to ensure that if we do

 4   continue, which is contemplated at some of

 5   them, that we'll be transparent, you'll know

 6   what is being funded by when and the faculty

 7   members have control over the content and the

 8   curriculum, which was one of the main issues.

 9         And it's really an issue -- as a

10   chancellor of the State University of

11   New York, you want to make sure your faculty

12   owns the curriculum, owns the content in

13   their classroom.   And that's federal law,

14   that's SUNY policy, and that's the way those

15   particular contracts will read.

16         SENATOR STAVISKY:    I was particularly

17   troubled when I read -- and perhaps it was

18   inaccurate -- that the contract between the

19   Confucius Institute at Binghamton was not

20   with the university, but with the Research

21   Foundation.

22         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Right.

23         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Would you comment

24   on that?   Because I think there's certainly a
                                                        36

 1   lack of -- the Research Foundation is far

 2   better than it was when I first joined the

 3   Legislature, and in fact asked questions at

 4   the budget hearing about 10 years ago.     It is

 5   far better, but it's still very -- to me,

 6   very troubling.

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So the Research

 8   Foundation, as you know, was established I

 9   think in 1977 to support the -- maybe '57,

10   one of those "seven" years -- to support the

11   research enterprise of the State University

12   of New York and to monitor and to track.    And

13   we have put in place in the last few years a

14   very strong board, on which SUNY has

15   representation, and they monitor and manage

16   all of our research contracts.

17         So because these contracts have to do

18   with international exchange and they are a

19   funded research contract, that would be the

20   vehicle by which SUNY engages in any contract

21   with anyone, is through the Research

22   Foundation.

23         Having said that, I just want to

24   reiterate, we are going to be open,
                                                       37

 1   transparent, and make sure that we account --

 2   and we'll be glad to get back to you with all

 3   the funding that's going through the Research

 4   Foundation, in particular for the Confucius

 5   Institutes.

 6          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 7          One last quick question.   I received a

 8   memo from the University Police, and it was

 9   troubling because of the attrition, the fact

10   that we spend time and money training these

11   officers and they leave.   And there are --

12   apparently they have some issues with the

13   university, and I think you ought to have an

14   opportunity to respond.

15          Have you seen the --

16          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    I have not.   But

17   I'd be more than happy to receive the letter.

18          SENATOR STAVISKY:   We'll provide you

19   with a copy.   Oh, you'll hear their

20   testimony, I think, today.    But I will

21   provide you with a copy.

22          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Great.   Thank

23   you.

24          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 2           We've been joined by Assemblywoman

 3   Bichotte, Assemblyman Fall.     And we go to

 4   Assemblyman Epstein for questions.

 5           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Thank you.

 6           And thank you for being with us today.

 7   I do appreciate your testimony.    But I just

 8   have some real concerns about what you're

 9   proposing.   And just, you know, along those

10   lines with Assemblywoman Glick was talking

11   about where we're seeing so much food

12   insecurity on our campuses, people struggling

13   to make ends meet, people going part-time

14   because they can't afford to continue to go

15   to school -- and then we're making choices

16   around expanding Excelsior but cutting other

17   programs where students have much greater

18   need.

19           And I'm wondering what the logic is to

20   expand a program from 125 to 150 when we see

21   students who can't afford the tuition

22   increase that we're proposing, students who

23   tell us every day they can't drop out.       My

24   daughter attends a SUNY, and there are so
                                                         39

 1   many friends of hers who will not be able to

 2   eat each month on campus because they don't

 3   have the resources.

 4         So I'm just concerned around this

 5   choice.   And why not expand the EOP programs?

 6   Why not put resources for people who have

 7   deeper need?   Why not get from a thousand to

 8   5,000 for those people we know it will make a

 9   difference in their lives.   And that we -- we

10   talked about getting people at lower economic

11   situations to higher, that's an exact

12   opportunity to do it.   And I'm just not --

13   I'm baffled, really, by the choices here.

14         So I'd love to hear what the logic       is

15   to making these choices around expanding

16   Excelsior but not really expanding for

17   programs with deeper needs and students who

18   are struggling on our campuses every day.

19         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So, first of all,

20   thank you very much for the question.    And

21   look, it resonates with me, being able to go

22   to college and come out debt-free.   Because I

23   went to university on a full scholarship,

24   both tuition and room and board.   I could not
                                                      40

 1   have gone otherwise.   So you're speaking

 2   exactly to this kid 40 years ago.

 3         That said, I don't think we need to

 4   make a choice between one or the other.     I

 5   think we need to do it all.    And I think I

 6   was -- well, we were all thrilled that the

 7   EOP program, the EOC program and the Attain

 8   programs were all continued in the Executive

 9   Budget.    So I think that's showing the

10   Governor's strong support for exactly the

11   individuals that you're talking about that we

12   care greatly about.    And I would love to see

13   those programs increased.

14         At the same time we have a lot of need

15   for students -- you know, depending on where

16   you live, those levels are meaningful and are

17   challenging.   Going to food insecurity,

18   that's exactly why we put a food pantry or

19   access to a food pantry -- and I've visited

20   many of these, in fact, and they're

21   wonderful.   In fact at many of our campuses

22   they're run by students, which is just

23   awesome.

24         So we need to continue to be vigilant.
                                                     41

 1   We need to continue to bring resources to

 2   SUNY.   And that's why, you know, I'm quite

 3   interested -- one of my top priorities is

 4   really philanthropy and helping our campuses

 5   or working very hard to bring outside

 6   resources to bear for our campuses so that we

 7   can continue to create the kind of programs

 8   we need if we're going to be that social

 9   mobility engine.

10           And that's, I think, the thing that's

11   quite interesting now.   When we look at the

12   cost of educating the student -- and I said

13   this in my testimony, but I think it bears

14   repeating, if I do say so myself -- 18.3 new

15   net jobs created since we started emerging

16   from the Great Recession 10 years ago, 18.3.

17   Eighteen of those went to individuals with

18   some kind of college education.   And more

19   than that, 2 million jobs that were there for

20   students who only had a high school education

21   vanished.

22           So everyone needs a college degree.

23   Everybody has to have access to this.    We

24   have to support all our students going
                                                      42

 1   forward and particularly, of course, the most

 2   vulnerable.    I can't tell you how awesome it

 3   was to go to that ceremony and see 42

 4   outstanding students that had special needs,

 5   families struggling, and were doing

 6   fabulously because of the support of the EOP

 7   program.

 8           So I support what you're saying.    We

 9   should increase --

10           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Good, I would

11   love to see ways to expand that.

12           Same thing when we passed the DREAM

13   Act.    And I know a lot of students have

14   applied.    How many students have applied for

15   DREAM and TAP funding, how many students

16   applied versus how many got it?    It would be

17   great to know what the differential is and

18   what's going on there.

19           And the last thing I'll raise, because

20   I know I'm out of time, is I would love to

21   see dedicated funding streams for CUNY and

22   SUNY.   I'd love to see real dollars going.

23   And I know we have a concern about additional

24   revenue, but we've got to close that TAP gap,
                                                         43

 1   because we need to do that.

 2         And we'd love to see you partner with

 3   us to -- I've got legislation and other

 4   people have legislation to direct funding to

 5   CUNY and SUNY.   And we just need to have

 6   dedicated funding streams, because we're

 7   going to be in this fight where we expand the

 8   TAP gap every year with tuition increases as

 9   you're proposing.

10         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:       Totally agree.

11   And in fact if I may just --

12         (Timeclock chirping.)

13         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:       Sure.

14         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:       Can I?    May I,

15   Chairpersons?    Okay.

16         I think that there's even something

17   more we need to do.      Because I think that

18   it's not good enough now just to educate

19   students in the kind of fields that they love

20   and aspire -- which we need to do that.        We

21   also need to layer on top of that

22   entrepreneurship, innovation, the way that we

23   can help.   When you've got a SUNY -- I mean,

24   this is, I think, the big idea.     Right?
                                                       44

 1   It's -- you've got a SUNY campus with an --

 2   almost 90 percent of every New Yorker within

 3   30 miles.   And we have this outmigration from

 4   upstate to downstate.     Right?   We all know

 5   this.   And the Governor has put together the

 6   REDCs to get at that.

 7           Now, imagine that the students -- you

 8   know, I said during my testimony that

 9   75 percent after three to four years are

10   still living in the State of New York.

11   Suppose we unleash their innovation, their

12   entrepreneurship, and we help them stay in

13   place and create those companies.      It would

14   be phenomenal.

15           And I highlighted one of those at the

16   SOTUS, which is Ben Conard, who did Five

17   North Chocolate.   He learned about

18   entrepreneurship at Geneseo; he's using a

19   kitchen at Stony Brook.    That's what we need

20   to unleash in this state, and we can do it.

21   With a little more support.

22           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

23           We've been joined by Assemblyman

24   McDonald.
                                                       45

 1         Now to the Senate.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 3         Next, Jim Seward, ranker on Finance.

 4         SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you,

 5   Madam Chair.

 6         And thank you, Chancellor.     It's been

 7   a real pleasure working with you since you

 8   came here to New York and the SUNY system, on

 9   behalf of the many SUNY campuses I have in my

10   district and the system as a whole.

11         I wanted to return to a discussion of

12   the proposed tuition authorization hikes that

13   are included in the budget.   How much revenue

14   will be generated if these proposed tuition

15   increases are implemented?

16         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So for every $100

17   increase in tuition, the net, net of the TAP

18   gap and Excelsior, is about $9 million.    So a

19   $200 increase would generate about

20   $18 million net each year.

21         SENATOR SEWARD:   Per year.

22         You know, with the proposed increase

23   in the income eligibility for the Excelsior

24   scholarship, and with these proposed tuition
                                                       46

 1   hikes only being paid by non-Excelsior

 2   students, what percentage of SUNY students

 3   will actually be paying the increase?    Do you

 4   know offhand?

 5         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So I don't know

 6   offhand, but we'll get back to you on that.

 7   We can calculate it.

 8         And the reason why is in part, as you

 9   know, Excelsior is the last dollar.   And so

10   when it looks to increase, you need to back

11   out students that would be eligible for TAP,

12   students that would be eligible for

13   Excelsior.   You know, we just have to do a

14   little bit of sharpening a pencil.

15         SENATOR SEWARD:   Do you have any

16   concerns -- for those students who do not

17   qualify for Excelsior, do you have any

18   concerns about as the tuition goes up, that

19   their average student loan debt will also go

20   up upon graduation?

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Well, we're very

22   concerned about, you know, the debt of our

23   students.

24         And you may know this, but the average
                                                       47

 1   debt -- so half of our students graduated

 2   debt-free, roughly -- 47.3 percent.     Call it

 3   a half for now.    The other students, on

 4   average, will have upwards about 27K in debt

 5   when they graduate, like on average.

 6         So we're very concerned about that.

 7   We want to keep a SUNY education -- you know,

 8   it's a balancing act -- affordable but also

 9   high quality.     And that's where, you know,

10   the support is so -- you know, so appreciated

11   from the Legislature and the Governor to be

12   able to do that.

13         SENATOR SEWARD:     I wanted to shift

14   gears to the community colleges.     You know,

15   last year the enacted budget included a

16   hold-harmless provision to offset some of the

17   enrollment declines on many of our community

18   college campuses.    And actually there was a

19   base aid increase of $100 as well.

20         Neither of these are included in the

21   Executive's proposal.    Do you have concerns

22   about how our community college campuses are

23   going to absorb both the flat base aid

24   funding that's included in the budget as well
                                                      48

 1   as dealing with anticipated loss of funding

 2   due to, you know, some additional projected

 3   enrollment declines?

 4           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So of our

 5   415,000 -- that's head count -- students,

 6   192,000 are community college.     So roughly

 7   half.   A little less, but about half.    So

 8   we're very concerned about that.

 9           We would very much like to see the

10   floor be put back in place, and that sort of

11   the held harmless, as well as an increase in

12   per-head count.

13           As I said earlier in the testimony,

14   for many of our students this is the first

15   entree into higher ed.   And a lot of our

16   students commute, so the real cost for them

17   of education is tuition.   And so it would be

18   very helpful to re-look at the floor.

19           And, you know, the way I think I

20   described it maybe even at last year's

21   hearing was, you know, it's a little bit

22   like -- there are base costs and variable

23   costs of education.    And I know you know all

24   that.   It's like going into a restaurant, you
                                                       49

 1   know, and no matter if one person comes in

 2   the door or 10 go in the door, you've still

 3   got to pay the rent, you've got to keep the

 4   lights on, and you still have to have the --

 5   so those pay for the fixed costs.    And that's

 6   what the floor helps us do.

 7         And then the $100 increase for some of

 8   our community colleges that are increasing,

 9   that helps them pay with -- you know, like

10   the salad and the main course and all that,

11   which is more variable.

12         So we really think that it was a

13   terrific vision and insight from the

14   Legislature to put that in, and we'd be very

15   grateful to see that restored.

16         SENATOR SEWARD:     You would advocate

17   that we do it again this year.

18         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I'm sorry?

19         SENATOR SEWARD:     You would advocate

20   that we do that again this year.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Yes.

22         SENATOR SEWARD:     Just one final

23   question on capital.   You've outlined the

24   great needs that still exist out there on the
                                                        50

 1   various campuses.   Do you have any concerns

 2   about that two-for-one matching program

 3   that's in the budget that there will be,

 4   shall we say an uneven availability of these

 5   capital funds depending on whether or not a

 6   campus could meet the match?

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So we are looking

 8   very carefully at each and every campus to

 9   see what the ability is to do the match.     We

10   do believe that the majority of our campuses

11   will be able to do that.    In fact, the great

12   majority of our campuses will be able to do a

13   match from a variety of sources, whether it's

14   philanthropy or reserves or auxiliary

15   services or help from the SUNY system.

16         And so we look forward to working with

17   the campuses to get the new construction, you

18   know, moving that we really need for some of

19   these high-need programs.

20         SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

22         Assembly.

23         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We've been

24   joined by Assemblywoman Hyndman.

 1         And we go to Assemblywoman Lifton.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And we've been

 3   joined by Senator Rachel May.

 4         ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:     Good morning,

 5   Chancellor.

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Good morning.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:     I want to just

 8   second the concerns about the childcare

 9   centers on campus, Small Business Development

10   Centers, the Veterinary College at Cornell,

11   all very important investments for the state

12   and critical for people attending both two-

13   and four-year colleges.

14         I was glad to hear Senator Stavisky

15   talk about the full-time versus adjunct

16   faculty issue.   As the daughter of a SUNY

17   professor and --

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Can you talk

19   more into the -- or pull the mic a little

20   closer?

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:     -- and a leader

22   in SUNY for many years, secretary of the

23   State Faculty Senate many years ago, he would

24   not be happy if I didn't ask further about
                                                       52

 1   that.

 2            You know, we did the tuition increases

 3   over how many years, we did the rational

 4   tuition policy increases that were four

 5   years.    And I think we were sure that that

 6   was going to work to improve the education

 7   for students.    That was going to go towards

 8   improving the quality of students' education.

 9            I have to assume you would agree that

10   having full-time faculty and having good

11   numbers there would be an important piece of

12   that.    And I know this is -- I'm not laying

13   this at your doorstep, I lay it very much at

14   the state government's doorstep in terms of

15   support for SUNY.    But -- and we're talking

16   about another tuition increase.    Is it just

17   holding even?    Is it talking about progress?

18   And, you know, 50 percent adjunct faculty is

19   not a great number.    I was told eight years

20   ago, six years ago, five years ago that we

21   are working on it, we are improving it, we

22   are improving it.    And these don't look like

23   improved numbers to me at all.

24            Do you have goals on that?   Do you
                                                      53

 1   have a plan, given -- you know, if that

 2   tuition increase comes through here, is some

 3   of that going to go towards truly -- not just

 4   wishful thinking, but truly looking at the

 5   issue of full-time versus adjunct faculty?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Well, first of

 7   all, thank you very much for the question.

 8         Absolutely, I would love to see more

 9   full-time faculty.   Because when you have

10   full-time faculty, they're full-time.   So you

11   get extra -- the benefit of someone that's

12   there often for the mentoring and the office

13   hours and those sort of things.   Although I

14   must say that our adjunct faculty are very

15   dedicated as well.   And so converting some of

16   those positions to full-time would be a goal.

17         What I'd like to do is come back and

18   look at the history and look at what progress

19   we have made.   I know through some of the

20   innovation fund that I mentioned earlier, we

21   are actually using those funds to attract

22   full-time faculty.

23         Also something that I noticed my first

24   semester here at SUNY is that, you know,
                                                      54

 1   somewhere between a third and 40 percent of

 2   our faculty could retire over the horizon of

 3   when I'm chancellor.    So therefore we have

 4   initiated a program called PRODiG, as you may

 5   have heard about, where we've set a goal to

 6   hire a thousand underrepresented minority and

 7   women faculty over the next decade.   And we

 8   want to hire them early so that they can

 9   learn from the existing faculty and

10   understand -- you know, get mentored at that

11   time.

12           So we think it's a really important

13   program.   It's gotten off to a great start in

14   the first six months.    I mean, we announced

15   it at the SOTUS last January, we started to

16   stand it up with workshops in March, and then

17   proposals were due in July.    So we're really

18   in the first six months of this.    But we've

19   already hired 74 faculty through PRODiG, and

20   we expect that we'll be able to increase

21   that.

22           So this is a big focus of mine, not

23   just the -- it's demographics writ large.

24   It's the do our students that are 35 percent
                                                        55

 1   underrepresented minority, are they seeing

 2   someone in the classroom that looks like

 3   them?   So that they see it, they can be it.

 4   Well, when you only have 9 percent of your

 5   faculty underrepresented minorities, they're

 6   not seeing it, as much as we think that it

 7   would be helpful.

 8           So that's one reason why we launched

 9   this.   We've put a number out there, a

10   thousand over a decade.   We don't think it's

11   too aggressive.   We will accomplish that.

12   And so, yes, faculty and supporting our

13   faculty is one of the highest priorities you

14   can possibly have as a leader in the

15   institution.

16           ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:    Of course I

17   support that program.   It sounds like a very

18   important program to be doing.     I know you've

19   spoken about it before.

20           Are we going to see a bump up in those

21   numbers from 50 percent to 55 percent or

22   60 percent over the next five years,

23   especially --

24           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So we are
                                                          56

 1   about -- yeah.    No, it's a good question.

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:     -- especially

 3   with a tuition increase?

 4            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     And let me

 5   apologize, we should come back to that.

 6            ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:    That's all

 7   right.

 8            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So if you look at

 9   the national averages, we are about 4 to

10   5 percent lower than we should be.      So I

11   think last year we provided some information

12   about what it would cost -- what it would

13   take to move the numbers by 10 percent.        I

14   don't remember that number off the top of my

15   head.    But I -- then we looked at the data

16   and we saw that really we're national average

17   probably low -- more on the order of 4 or

18   5 percent than 10.

19            So if it would be okay, we'll come

20   back with an estimate on what it would cost

21   and how that would work with a tuition

22   increase from that.

23            ASSEMBLYWOMAN LIFTON:    Thank you,

24   Chancellor.

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 2           To the Senate now.

 3           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 4           We've been joined by Senator Brad

 5   Hoylman, and Senator John Liu is next up for

 6   questions.

 7           SENATOR LIU:   Thank you, Madam Chair.

 8           Chancellor, we've got issues.    Oh, I

 9   apologize.    I'm a proud graduate of SUNY

10   Binghamton.

11           We have issues, Chancellor.    And the

12   issue is that we're not -- we're not

13   investing enough money in this state for

14   education.    There's a great deal of focus on

15   I guess what some people call lower

16   education, the elementary through high school

17   education, and the need for more Foundation

18   Aid.    But it's clear that we also need more

19   money for our higher education, both SUNY and

20   CUNY.

21           I have some questions because, you

22   know, it's been difficult to get some very

23   clear numbers out there.     So perhaps you

24   would have them off the top of your head.
                                                        58

 1   And if not, then you can ask your staff to

 2   follow up with me.

 3         But basically, what's the total

 4   operating budget of SUNY, the whole system?

 5         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      The whole system.

 6   I think it's around 3, 3.5 billion?     Eileen?

 7         SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:     {Inaudible.}

 8   Thirteen billion.

 9         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Yeah, 13 billion.

10         SENATOR LIU:   Yeah, 13 billion.     And

11   how much of that is state support versus

12   tuition?

13         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      I think that's

14   the number that's about 3.5.

15         SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:     Thirty percent.

16         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Thirty percent.

17   So it's about 3.9 billion, direct and

18   indirect.

19         SENATOR LIU:   Yeah, that's very close.

20   I mean, I've got a chart here that says state

21   support is 32 percent, and the remaining

22   68 percent is supported by tuition.

23         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Right.

24         SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:     {Inaudible.}
                                                        59

 1           SENATOR LIU:   Right, that's a --

 2   what's that?

 3           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    In-hospital

 4   revenues, patient visits and so forth.

 5           SENATOR LIU:   Okay.   But that's a

 6   small amount, right?

 7           (Overtalk; inaudible.)

 8           SENATOR LIU:   Twenty-five -- so it's

 9   25 percent hospital revenues, 32 percent

10   state support and the remaining 43 percent

11   would be tuition?

12           SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:   Tuition, fees,

13   yes.

14           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Tuition, fees.

15   Would some of that be auxiliary services too?

16           SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:   It's in the

17   fees.

18           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Yeah, it's in the

19   fees, okay.

20           SENATOR LIU:   And that 43 percent from

21   tuition and fees is much higher -- it's a

22   much higher percentage than it was perhaps 10

23   years ago.

24           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    We can look that
                                                       60

 1   up.   I don't know that number off the top --

 2           SENATOR LIU:   Okay.   Well, I mean, I

 3   don't -- I have some numbers here.     It says

 4   here that the state support was 46 percent

 5   nine years ago.   So it's down to 32 percent.

 6   So we're clearly -- I mean, the state is just

 7   not coughing up where it should.    And that's

 8   not your fault, Chancellor, I'm just putting

 9   it out there.

10           So what do you think the trajectory is

11   with these tuition increases?    Is it -- with

12   the tuition increases, is it even going to be

13   more than 43 percent tuition-supported?      Is

14   it -- is more than 43 percent -- is even more

15   than 43 percent of the SUNY operating costs

16   going to be paid for by student tuition and

17   fees?   And what's the trajectory here?

18           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    I think the

19   trajectory will depend, you know, on some of

20   the ways that we can work together to improve

21   not just -- actually, to create new revenue

22   streams.   So that's one of the reasons why

23   I'm really pushing philanthropy.    It's

24   another reason why we are working at SUNY
                                                     61

 1   Online, which is our online platform, to

 2   launch that.

 3         Because if you look at the

 4   trajectory -- and we've done this in great

 5   detail.   From where we are now with 415,000

 6   students in 2020 to where we're going to be

 7   in 2025, if we don't have some sort of

 8   intervention with regard to garnering more

 9   out-of-state students or increasing the

10   number of students that go to higher ed in

11   the state, or through our online platform,

12   then we will be down probably tens of

13   thousands of more students.

14         Which will be harder to make up with

15   tuition and fees if you're losing, you know,

16   enrollment.    So enrollment is a laser focus

17   for us right now as well.

18         SENATOR LIU:    You're -- you're afraid

19   that enrollment will decline?

20         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Well, you see

21   that for the first time, I think over the

22   last four years it's -- actually, over the

23   last 40 years there's been outmigration from

24   the state.    I mean, this is not a new
                                                      62

 1   phenomenon.   The state has been losing

 2   population, and it isn't being offset by

 3   immigration and new natural births.    So we

 4   are having a statewide, you know, decline in

 5   population.

 6         SENATOR LIU:   But tuition is being

 7   increased not to make up for a declining or

 8   at least a flat level of enrollment, right?

 9   Tuition is being increased because of

10   increased operating costs.

11         It just feels like the tuition

12   increases are higher than the increases in

13   operating costs.   Which is why that

14   percentage keeps growing larger.

15         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So I think

16   that -- I am very sensitive to increasing

17   costs for our students.    I think that one

18   gets a little bit of a contextual view of

19   that if we look at what's the tuition

20   in-state at Connecticut, New Jersey,

21   Pennsylvania, and our border states, our

22   so-called border states.   So it's about 4,000

23   to $5,000 more per year.

24         SENATOR LIU:   Okay.    Thank you.
                                                           63

 1         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So -- I mean, but

 2   that's the real -- so our -- if we charged --

 3   our out-of-state tuition is $18,070.       The

 4   in-state tuition of our border states is

 5   about 12,000.    Which is about 5,000 more than

 6   our in-state and about 5,000 less than our

 7   out-of-state.

 8         SENATOR LIU:     Regardless of whether

 9   they're coming from in-state or out-of-state,

10   it's -- you said 75 percent of the graduates

11   do stay in New York.

12         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     That's right.      So

13   we want to attract them to the state.      And

14   SUNY can be that engine that attracts

15   students to the state because of outstanding

16   institutions like your alma mater.

17         SENATOR LIU:     And attract corporations

18   and employers.   Thank you, Madam Chair.

19         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

20         Assembly.

21         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

22         We go to Assemblywoman Fahy.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Thank you.

24         Thank you.    A pleasure to see you and
                                                     64

 1   have you here, Chancellor.

 2         A few things, not to repeat some of

 3   the questions, but I just -- one of the first

 4   questions and comments was on the TAP gap,

 5   and I just want to reiterate those concerns.

 6   I share the concerns that we really need to

 7   address that and hear it all the time, not

 8   just from the students, but also from the

 9   universities, so want to reiterate that.

10         Also love the continued graduation

11   rates and good feedback on the EOP program.

12   So I just wish it was there for everybody

13   that applied.   So I want to also share in

14   those comments and support for the EOP

15   programs.   I have to wonder why we're not

16   doing a little more there.

17         Finally, your comment on the

18   credit-bearing courses is just -- that's

19   really good news.   For years we had heard

20   about the remedial courses, we were losing

21   students being saddled with remedial courses

22   and then not making it or giving up on them.

23         Couple of questions.   In the community

24   colleges, the cut -- can you explain the cut
                                                        65

 1   and can you address the charge-back issue?

 2   There's a reduction of 22 million on the

 3   community colleges.     Is that all due to

 4   enrollment?   And do we know how that will

 5   affect Hudson Valley here?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So the

 7   22 million, you're saying, without having the

 8   floor or an increase of $100 per student,

 9   that will be a net of about 22 million.

10         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:      That's what's in

11   the books.

12         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So -- well, we're

13   hoping that the floor will get reinstituted.

14         And we'd also like to have an increase

15   in the head count.    So I will have to do some

16   good work on advocacy to see if we can put

17   back the floor.

18         I don't know how it will specifically

19   impact Hudson Valley.    Some of that will

20   depend on enrollment.    Some of that will

21   depend on -- but we can certainly get you

22   that information.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:      Okay.    And I'd

24   love the update on the chargeback issue,
                                                        66

 1   which becomes -- it's an annual issue I bring

 2   up between Rensselaer County and Albany

 3   County, and would appreciate the feedback on

 4   that, because Albany County gets hit and yet

 5   we have more students there at Hudson Valley,

 6   a terrific community college.

 7          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     If I could -- can

 8   I just say one thing on the chargeback?

 9          ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Sure.

10          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So we have put

11   together a working group studying the

12   chargeback, seeing how we might be able to be

13   helpful there, and we can come back to you

14   with where that is.

15          That's one thing that I promised we

16   would do last year at the hearing.

17          ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Okay.   And we've

18   had working groups before on that, so I

19   really am anxious to see the update.

20          Childcare, that's been mentioned, the

21   cut.   Serious concern.   Childcare is just a

22   crisis throughout the state.

23          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Yes, absolutely.

24          ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     And I was very
                                                      67

 1   concerned to see that even we would cut that.

 2   I know that's been mentioned before, so I

 3   want to get that in.

 4         Sustainability, along with capital

 5   funding.   I know since you've been here,

 6   sustainability and energy efficiency of the

 7   SUNY buildings -- which I understand are

 8   40 percent of the state-owned buildings in

 9   the state.    I know you keep mentioning it.

10   I'm pleased that the Governor has proposed a

11   $200 million increase.   Tell me how much that

12   it is in comparison to what the needs would

13   be.

14         As you know, I've talked before about

15   expanding on the bond, the    Environmental

16   Bond Act, so that we can address SUNY and

17   CUNY needs.    But what do you need to get at

18   this sustainability issue that I know you've

19   championed since you've been here?

20         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Right.   So we

21   proposed -- we have 550 for critical

22   maintenance.   And last year we proposed an

23   additional 200 a year in order -- the best

24   time to do -- and I know you all know this,
                                                          68

 1   but energy efficiency and upgrade is when

 2   you're doing critical maintenance.     So if

 3   you're going to replace the roof anyway, then

 4   that's when you want to put in the

 5   insulation, because you're going to increase,

 6   you know, the better insulation because

 7   you're going to be having to replace it.       So

 8   it's just more efficient to do it at that

 9   time.

10            So additional funding in order to

11   address the energy efficiency through

12   critical maintenance would be great.    The

13   match also allows us to get at the need for

14   new construction.

15            So we have between, say -- well, I'll

16   just say a couple of billion and I'll get

17   back to you -- over a period of time like

18   five years of new construction on the drawing

19   board.    So it's new engineering buildings,

20   you know, at Stony Brook and at Albany and

21   Buffalo and Binghamton.    There are new

22   buildings at the university centers.       There's

23   new buildings at Purchase.    And then there's

24   a renovation, which is more like a new
                                                       69

 1   building, of the natural sciences at

 2   Old Westbury.    We have tremendous needs in

 3   the STEM area and we need -- and it's on the

 4   order of billions over a period of time.

 5         And it's that surety of knowing those

 6   fundings will be there year after year so

 7   that we can plan it, design it, construct it

 8   and move in.    And that whole process can take

 9   four to five years.    So having that support

10   there is just very important.

11         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Okay, Chancellor,

12   I really would love to hear more on this.

13   I'm almost out of time.   I'd be remiss if I

14   didn't mention our own parochial need here in

15   that engineering building at UAlbany.    But

16   I'd love to hear what the overall number is

17   to get at this retrofitting and energy

18   efficiency for the SUNY buildings.     Because

19   again, I think we need to go beyond what is

20   proposed.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     And we'll get

22   back to you on that in detail.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Okay, thank you.

24         Thank you, Madam Chair.

 1         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 2         Senator Robert Jackson.

 3         SENATOR JACKSON:    Good morning,

 4   Chancellor.

 5         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Good morning.

 6         SENATOR JACKSON:    It's always good to

 7   see you.

 8         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    It's good to see

 9   you too.

10         SENATOR JACKSON:    And I'm surprised

11   you don't have other staff up there with you,

12   but it appears as though you're so

13   knowledgeable about the fact that -- the

14   statistics that you're putting out.    And I

15   clearly believe you're a highly qualified

16   professional doing the best job that you can.

17         But let me ask you a question.      I'm

18   looking at some of the highlights.     So the

19   Higher Education Services Corporation is

20   being cut 5.3 percent.   What impact is that

21   going to have on children, young adults,

22   getting into college, in your opinion?

23         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So HESC

24   obviously, and I saw Guillermo here, supports
                                                          71

 1   all of our Excelsior and supports many other

 2   programs such as STEM programs.      And they're

 3   very important to the success of both SUNY

 4   and CUNY.    So I --

 5            SENATOR JACKSON:    But it will have an

 6   impact, though.     I would --

 7            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Yes, it will.

 8   Yes, sir.

 9            SENATOR JACKSON:    What are they

10   cutting, 64 what?

11            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I'm not -- I

12   don't know the exact number, but --

13            SENATOR JACKSON:    Sixty-four million

14   dollars, I think, out of an $18 billion

15   budget.     Clearly it's going to have an impact

16   when you're cutting that much money out.         I

17   mean, I'm looking at SUNY overall is an

18   increase of 6.5 percent, is that correct?

19   That's what it says here.      Am I right or

20   wrong?

21            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     SUNY overall

22   would be 1.9 percent, we had requested in our

23   budget, from base aid.      I'm sure more than

24   that, because of the benefits and the costs
                                                        72

 1   there.

 2            SENATOR JACKSON:   So with respect to

 3   that, knowing this budget is -- a lot of talk

 4   was about tuition, so -- and there is a

 5   proposal on the table to continue the $200

 6   per year for the next five years.    Would you

 7   be in favor of freezing it where it is now,

 8   with no increase, and let the State of

 9   New York pick up -- you said it's $18 million

10   per year, is that right, TAP?

11            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Eighteen million,

12   that's net, yeah.    That's taking into account

13   the gap.

14            SENATOR JACKSON:   Okay, 18 million.

15   But will you be willing to just charge no

16   additional tuition for students coming in and

17   the State of New York would just pick up that

18   cost factor?    When you look at a $178 billion

19   budget, that's not a lot of money, would you

20   agree?

21            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Sorry --

22            SENATOR JACKSON:   That is not a lot of

23   money to freeze it and just whatever the cost

24   factor is, in order to continue to provide
                                                      73

 1   the colleges and universities the monies that

 2   we'd get from normal tuition that students

 3   are paying for.

 4          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     We certainly

 5   would love to work with you on exploring the

 6   ability to make SUNY even more affordable to

 7   our students as well as get the support we

 8   need for the ongoing operations, including

 9   the well-deserved and long overdue pay raises

10   to our faculty and staff, our operations, and

11   also putting in place the floor for the

12   community colleges.   So we would look forward

13   to having a conversation.

14          SENATOR JACKSON:   And talking about

15   the operations and talking about staff, what

16   is the situation with your unionized staff?

17   I think your -- most of the staff at SUNY is

18   represented by UUP, is that correct?

19          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     That's correct,

20   yes.

21          SENATOR JACKSON:     Has that contract

22   expired?   What's going on with that?

23          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     No, it was just

24   renewed -- I think it was last year?     And
                                                         74

 1   therefore it's -- there is a retroactive

 2   piece for two years and then going forward

 3   for four years, and it's a 2 percent base and

 4   a 1 percent merit.

 5           SENATOR JACKSON:    And how was that

 6   covered in the budget process?      I mean, did

 7   the State of New York then give that

 8   additional money to cover that contract, or

 9   it would expect to be taken out of the hides

10   of the colleges?

11           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Well, we would

12   love to work with you to explore ways that we

13   can make SUNY even more affordable.

14           SENATOR JACKSON:    I understand.    I

15   know you will -- I know you want to work with

16   me.    I asked the question, was the -- did the

17   State of New York pick up that and pay for

18   that, or is it expected to come out of the

19   hides of the colleges?     That's my question to

20   you.    That's a direct question.

21           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Yeah.   The direct

22   base aid has been flat over the last, I

23   think, so many years.

24           SENATOR JACKSON:    So in essence,
                                                        75

 1   then, it has not been picked up by the

 2   government overall.

 3         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Well, base aid

 4   has remained flat.    But of course our debt

 5   service and our benefits are paid for, and

 6   we're very grateful for that, from the state,

 7   because that's an expensive -- as you know,

 8   the increase in the overall budget is, as you

 9   said, over 6 percent because of the increased

10   costs and because of the debt service that

11   we're very, very happy to receive.

12         SENATOR JACKSON:     But, I mean, you

13   would say that all of your staff deserve a

14   raise in order to live appropriately and --

15   from a normal point of view, is that correct?

16         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I do support our

17   staff receiving raises, absolutely.

18         SENATOR JACKSON:     Uh-huh.   So overall,

19   from a capital point of view, my

20   understanding in hearing all around that the

21   capital amount of money needs to be

22   increased.   Do you agree with that or

23   disagree with that?    Or you have --

24         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I believe there's
                                                         76

 1   300 million in the Governor's budget for

 2   capital, and we're very excited about that.

 3           SENATOR JACKSON:   You're what?

 4           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     There's 300

 5   million in appropriations --

 6           SENATOR JACKSON:   You said you're

 7   satisfied with that or you're happy about

 8   that?

 9           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I'm happy about

10   that.   Two hundred of that is new capital,

11   and 100 of that is match from SUNY.

12           SENATOR JACKSON:   Well, I don't -- I'm

13   not happy about that.

14           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Well, then I'm --

15   okay.

16           (Laughter.)

17           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     You get to remain

18   unhappy about that, Senator Jackson.

19           SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you.   Thank

20   you, Madam Chair.

21           (Laughter.)

22           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    And we go to

23   Assemblywoman Buttenschon.

24           ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:    Thank you,
                                                     77

 1   Chancellor, for being here today.     I

 2   appreciate your efforts, as a SUNY graduate

 3   also.

 4            My colleagues have brought up many

 5   issues that are very concerning, I know, to

 6   you also, the TAP gap, EOP, and many aspects.

 7   I do just want to touch back on the adjunct

 8   ratio.    You said it was 70/30 in our

 9   community colleges.

10            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Correct.

11            ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:   Is that

12   something we're looking at to change?     My

13   rationale, obviously, is many of these

14   students, this is their first time coming

15   into a higher educational setting, and the

16   need for those faculty that are experienced

17   and working full-time.

18            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So, you know,

19   adjuncts -- there's many different ways that

20   an adjunct works with us at SUNY.     Some of

21   the adjuncts are what you might call

22   professors of the practice.    As you said,

23   they are full-time or they're part-time in

24   the workforce or retired, and they have such
                                                      78

 1   a wealth of experience we definitely -- you

 2   know, we love all our adjuncts, and those are

 3   a particular set of experiences that we

 4   relish.

 5         You know, I think the opportunity to

 6   capture newly minted Ph.D.s or masters in the

 7   community college who want to make a career

 8   out of teaching with SUNY by converting those

 9   adjunct positions to full-time would be

10   really terrific.   So I think that's something

11   that we really need to look at.

12         I think without a funding floor or a

13   per -- and/or the increase in the individual

14   state support for the students, it would be

15   difficult to do that.

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:    I guess so

17   the question is, are you looking to change

18   those numbers?   Or you're just going to

19   continue to remain at 70/30 and feel, I guess

20   as my colleague stated, satisfied or happy?

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Sure, yeah.

22   Well, I'd like to increase the full-time

23   faculty, absolutely.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:   And then a
                                                        79

 1   question regarding mental health obviously

 2   facing so many of our institutions.    You have

 3   created a task force.    Is this a new task

 4   force or is it a task force that's been in

 5   place?    And when do you anticipate hearing

 6   recommendations from this task force?

 7            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Certainly.   So

 8   this is a task force that I put in place in

 9   the fall.    It's had already two meetings, and

10   I've attended one of them.     It will come back

11   with recommendations.    And, you know, it's

12   borne out by the fact that according to the

13   one survey by Healthy Minds, about 39 percent

14   of the students that responded are

15   experiencing some significant mental health

16   issue.

17            Well, that's a high percentage.    I

18   mean, you know, you have to ask, well, how

19   many base and what was the survey response,

20   and I get all that.    But it's still a

21   significant number.    And this is, you know,

22   part of the challenge, is that we know that

23   our students, to be successful, need all

24   kinds of support.    They need academic
                                                      80

 1   support, they need food security support,

 2   mental health, in some cases, support.

 3         So these are things we want to be

 4   there to provide.   Childcare.   That's one of

 5   the reasons why we would like to see the

 6   telehealth mental counseling funding

 7   restored.   So yes, it's very important to us.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:    And as my

 9   colleague Fahy stated about the numbers, I

10   would be interested in those numbers --

11         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Okay, very good.

12         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BUTTENSCHON:     -- of

13   students that are in.

14         And then just a little bit on the

15   connection with workforce development in

16   regards to new initiatives that you see this

17   year, possibly at different colleges,

18   four-year and two, that you find have helped

19   gap that link, possibly, for the need of

20   workforce within expanding industry.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So over the last

22   year, and one of the successes that we've

23   had -- and again, this is really due to the

24   work of our senior vice chancellor Johanna
                                                     81

 1   Duncan-Poitier, working with Department of

 2   Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon -- we've

 3   garnered about 17 million in support

 4   altogether.   About half of that is from the

 5   state, and half of that is from federal and

 6   philanthropic organizations.

 7           So these are programs where we're

 8   increasing the number of apprenticeships, the

 9   number of companies.   We now have I think

10   over 300 companies that we're working with in

11   order to give that internship, that

12   apprenticeship.   Because what we've found is

13   if a student in business, IT, or the

14   performing arts gets an internship, their

15   starting salary is $26,000 more with IT, it's

16   $9,000 more in business, and it's $13,000, if

17   I are remember that right, for the performing

18   arts.   That's phenomenal.   That's a very

19   large percentage of their starting salary.

20           So it's -- part of my commitment to

21   individualized learning and education is

22   those applied learning experiences, which is

23   really the hallmark of what SUNY is known

24   for.

 4         Senate?

 5         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 6         Senator Gounardes.

 7         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    Good morning.

 8   Thank you.    I want to just start off by

 9   echoing some of the comments that were made

10   earlier about, you know, the TAP gap funding

11   and how -- you know, maybe we should look to

12   redirect more funds to closing that gap

13   instead of expanding Excelsior.

14         And to Senator Liu's point about, you

15   know, the drop in public support for SUNY,

16   you know, nationwide, since the Great

17   Recession, funding for public education at

18   the higher education level has dropped by

19   $9 billion.    And we clearly have not met

20   that -- restored funding to that level across

21   the country, and clearly here in New York as

22   well, and that's very, very concerning.

23         And so I think we absolutely need to

24   be looking to see other ways to increase
                                                      83

 1   support for both SUNY and CUNY and public

 2   funding for that.     Because to keep pushing

 3   the burden onto students' shoulders is just

 4   not tenable.

 5         But I do want to kind of revisit the

 6   question about mental health that has been

 7   talked about a little bit.     How many --

 8   what's the ratio we have of mental health

 9   counselors to students right now across the

10   system?

11         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I'll have to get

12   back to you on that.    It's going to be

13   different at different campuses.    And of

14   course it's going to vary depending on the

15   size of the campus.    So I think that we want

16   to normalize it by the number of students.

17         I think that's one of the reasons why

18   we were pretty excited about the -- and we

19   are pretty excited about the telemedicine

20   mental health program that we had in place,

21   because we had have ten campuses involved

22   with that.   And that was being staffed by

23   psychiatrists at Upstate Medical University.

24   And it was very effective, but it got
                                                         84

 1   oversubscribed pretty quickly.    So we're

 2   hoping to expand that program, and that's why

 3   we're asking to restore some of the funding,

 4   or all the funding for the telecounseling

 5   program.

 6          SENATOR GOUNARDES:    That's the

 7   $500,000 that was proposed to be cut?

 8          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    That's correct,

 9   yes.

10          SENATOR GOUNARDES:    I think nationwide

11   the average is one counselor for every

12   1200 students.   And I think that where we are

13   in New York, I think it's significantly

14   higher than that.    According to the numbers

15   I've seen, it was like 2,000 in some cases,

16   you know, systemwide.    That's a very, very

17   big discrepancy.    And I think we need to do a

18   lot more to address that.    Because as you

19   point out, there are a large number of

20   students who need that type of support

21   service.

22          I want to transition a little bit.      Do

23   you have a sense of what percentage of our

24   graduates from SUNY end up entering the
                                                       85

 1   public service workforce or civil workforce,

 2   systemwide?

 3          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    You know, I

 4   don't, off the top of my head, but I'll get

 5   you those.    We have those numbers.    We can

 6   get them for you.

 7          SENATOR GOUNARDES:    And what is SUNY

 8   doing to create pathways for its graduates

 9   into the public sector, if anything?      Do we

10   have programs that currently exist?     Are we

11   doing things to recruit students to put them

12   onto these pathways?    Can you speak to that a

13   bit?

14          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Sure.    I know

15   that obviously the University at Albany has a

16   pretty big pipeline through to the

17   Legislature, and we meet a lot of alums when

18   we go through, you know, and make our visits.

19   So I know that that's one program for sure.

20          We do meet other students, obviously,

21   from some of our other SUNY campuses.      But

22   let me get you an inventory and I'll come

23   back to you on that -- both of those

24   questions.    One is the number of mental
                                                        86

 1   health counselors per student, and also what

 2   our programs do with regard to public

 3   service.   Both very important.

 4         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    And do you have

 5   any data as to how many students who have

 6   graduated with debt are enrolled in the

 7   public service loan forgiveness program?

 8         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     No, I don't.   But

 9   we'll come back to you on that.

10         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    Is that data that

11   you think that you might be able to collect

12   in the future or, find a way to get some type

13   of measure of that from your graduates?

14         SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:    Let me come back

15   to you.    I think that would be a good thing

16   to collect.

17         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    Because it's very

18   concerning, you know, with what's happening

19   with this program -- it's obviously a federal

20   program -- that only 3 percent of students

21   who are enrolled and eligible have been

22   granted forgiveness.   And so if we have a

23   large number of our own graduates who are

24   not -- who are being screwed by the system,
                                                           87

 1   we should know that and find ways to help

 2   address that.

 3         SUNY CFO McLOUGHLIN:      Absolutely.

 4   Thank you.    Great points.

 5         SENATOR GOUNARDES:      All the questions

 6   I have for you.    Thank you.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:       Assembly.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      We go to

 9   Assemblyman Smith.

10         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:      Thank you.

11         And thank you, Chancellor.         Our

12   students are so lucky to have you, with your

13   great background and your passion for this

14   new job.

15         So the campuses must make up the TAP

16   gap somehow.    If the state were to step in

17   and close the TAP gap, I assume that would

18   leave more money to spend on education.        What

19   are some of the things that could be done, or

20   what are your thoughts on that?

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:       Right.    So it's a

22   good point.     So with 82 million -- and that

23   would be distributed throughout all the

24   campuses.    So, you know, locally, I mean, you
                                                      88

 1   know, if you divide it by 64, you'd come up

 2   with a number that -- but again, it's going

 3   to be based on the number of students.

 4         So some of the things that you would

 5   use it for, if you were at a university

 6   center, those funds -- so let me just step

 7   back for a minute.   Where that money comes

 8   from is from tuition and fees.   Right?   And

 9   some probably philanthropy.   So if those

10   dollars were relieved, right, as you said,

11   they could go back into the academic mission.

12   So you could do things like more full-time

13   faculty.   You could renovate classrooms and

14   have them be more in line with sort of the

15   high-tech classrooms that many of their peer

16   institutions are seeing.

17         You could look at the operations that

18   could maintain some of the new facilities

19   that we desperately need to build for these

20   high-demand courses.   You could do curricular

21   development.   We looked at -- and I can get

22   you these numbers.   We have something like

23   3,000 labs and classrooms throughout SUNY,

24   and many of them need to be renovated.    They
                                                      89

 1   need to be wired, they need to be high-tech,

 2   there need to be smartboards, they need

 3   access to the internet.    And we've done an

 4   estimate of what that would cost.    So that's

 5   just to mention a few.

 6         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:    Okay, great --

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Also, you know,

 8   one of the things that I'm personally

 9   invested in and personally passionate about

10   is increasing the support at our

11   comprehensives for their master programs; at

12   our colleges of technologies and at our

13   community colleges, student scholarships and

14   fellowships.

15         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:    Great.   Now, is

16   SUNY going to be pushing for a representative

17   on the Medicaid Redesign Team, or is there

18   any push -- because as you mentioned in your

19   written testimony, that our SUNY

20   hospitals are safety net hospitals and they

21   serve a very important role.    So is that

22   going to be -- are you going to be pushing

23   for that or do we know if there's going to be

24   an appointment representing public hospitals?
                                                         90

 1           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    I don't know if

 2   there is, but we'd be willing to serve.     Of

 3   course I'm recommending someone back there

 4   (gesturing), right.

 5           ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:    I see Bob shaking

 6   his head.

 7           Now, in terms of the $500,000 cut to

 8   the telecounseling, is that something that

 9   consistently students mention that they

10   support?    I see, you know, some head nods.

11   Is that something that could be made up at

12   all -- you know, obviously I know many of us

13   are going to be advocating to get that

14   funding back in.   But any federal funds that

15   you think could be available to help with

16   that?   Because I think above the 500,000 -- I

17   think it should be expanded, really, given

18   the need.

19           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Yeah.   I think we

20   do need to expand it.    We can look for those

21   kinds of programs.    I'm not aware of any.

22   But we certainly are -- in fact, one of the

23   things that the SUNY system does is that we

24   focus on trying to garner external support,
                                                      91

 1   both from foundations and philanthropy

 2   sources and the federal government, to

 3   leverage our scope, size, scale and breadth

 4   in order to bring those resources to the

 5   state, do pilots, expand those pilots, and

 6   then be a leader for the rest of the country.

 7   So certainly that's within what we value and

 8   what we focus on.

 9         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:    Now, with the

10   Strategic Needs Capital Matching Program,

11   where's that funding coming from?   So would

12   it come from a foundation -- you know, if

13   it's not necessarily tuition or -- you know,

14   where would a SUNY campus be expected to --

15         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So we would look

16   at philanthropy, we would look at reserves,

17   we would look at auxiliary services, we would

18   look at synergies and efficiencies.

19         Let me give you an example.     We have

20   been reducing our energy use over time.     In

21   fact, one of the things that I'm very proud

22   of, and I just want to share all this, is

23   that in 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions

24   from our SUNY campuses were a million metric
                                                       92

 1   tons.    Today we've reduced them to 600,000.

 2   That's a 40 percent decrease by 2020 --

 3   39 percent, I'll be precise -- ahead of the

 4   State Energy Plan, that was in 2015, which

 5   called for the 40 percent reduction by 2030.

 6   We're on track to -- we're right now probably

 7   60 percent of our electricity is from

 8   renewable sources.   We've made a goal that

 9   by the end of SUNY at 75, we'll be

10   100 percent from renewable sources.

11            So some of those will create savings,

12   some of those initiatives where we are

13   conserving and not wasting.     So it's an

14   entire sustainability program that we're

15   going after.    Not printing paper, saving

16   25 million with not printers and toners and

17   paper.    You know, that's just one aspect of

18   the kind of savings that we're trying to

19   provide.

20            So, you know, there are many resources

21   that we're going to be pulling and trying to

22   get very conservative so we can afford the

23   new facilities that we need.

24            ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:   Thank you.
                                                      93

 1         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Thank you.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

 3         Senator Rachel May.

 4         SENATOR MAY:     Thank you.

 5         Good morning, Commissioner.      Nice to

 6   see you again.

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Good morning.

 8   Good to see you too.

 9         SENATOR MAY:     So this is -- I may

10   sound like a broken record from last year,

11   but because I represent four SUNY campuses

12   and five independent colleges, I'm always

13   concerned about policies that are pitting

14   them against each other.   Because they're all

15   important employers in my district, they all

16   serve students in different and unique ways.

17         And so the Excelsior expansion is one

18   that concerns me.   I know it concerns a lot

19   of the independent colleges.    And especially

20   when the TAP gap is increasing, it just seems

21   like maybe we're putting our resources in the

22   wrong place.

23         So I'm wondering -- there's been an

24   pretty steep decline in the number of
                                                       94

 1   students taking advantage of TAP over the

 2   last six or seven years.    You look surprised

 3   by that, so maybe you can't answer this --

 4         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     No, I'm trying to

 5   make a note.

 6         SENATOR MAY:    -- question, but I'm

 7   wondering if that's just a demographic shift

 8   or if you think that that's because the money

 9   just isn't going far enough, it's not worth

10   it to the students or if -- even if SUNY

11   campuses might be turning students down

12   because it costs them more to bring

13   TAP-eligible students in.

14         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     No, I will take

15   it on, the question, so thank you very much.

16         We have 60,000 students at our

17   state-operated campuses that receive TAP,

18   Tuition Assistance Program, and about 40,000

19   are community colleges.    So that's -- and

20   then when you add on the 20,000 from

21   Excelsior, that's about 120,000 out of our

22   400 and some thousand.    So it's a large --

23   which is great.   I mean, a majority of our

24   students are going tuition-free.
                                                         95

 1           So that's extremely important to us

 2   because, you know, just think about our

 3   founding DNA in 1948.     We were founded

 4   because higher ed wasn't always open to

 5   everyone who wanted to attend.     And so as a

 6   result, that's really core to our mission.

 7   So that's why I was a little surprised.      But

 8   we'll look at the numbers.

 9           We -- our campuses don't turn away

10   people because they're TAP.    Absolutely,

11   that's not -- again, that wouldn't be in our

12   DNA either.   It does mean, though, that the

13   campuses do provide financial aid to those

14   students.   And we're providing something like

15   $229 million of additional support.       Some of

16   that is the TAP, of course, which is helpful,

17   but some of that is the -- filling in the TAP

18   gap.

19           So making college affordable is one of

20   my number-one priorities.     Making it

21   excellent is the other.    They're the yin and

22   yang.   You can't really have one without the

23   other, or else you're paying for anything

24   that isn't worth anything.     So that's why
                                                      96

 1   it's critically important that we continue

 2   to -- and thank you for the support and the

 3   Governor for the support for higher ed,

 4   including our benefits and our debt service.

 5   And also any additional things that we can do

 6   will be put to great use.

 7            We love working with our private

 8   school colleagues as well.     And so I think

 9   that's one of the things -- in fact, I don't

10   know if you know this, but we have -- part of

11   our sustainability initiative is the

12   large-scale energy purchase, 150,000 megawatt

13   hours.    We have 20 campuses, four of which

14   are private, our private colleagues.    So

15   there are many different ways that we work

16   with our private colleges and they work with

17   us, so we need to continue to do that and --

18            SENATOR MAY:   So -- so let me follow

19   up with a question about that, because I also

20   have two Centers of Excellence in my

21   district, and the Centers of Excellence are

22   facing pretty drastic cuts in this budget.

23   SUNY ESF and Clarkson have a collaboration

24   that they just got approval for last year,
                                                     97

 1   but now they're -- it looks like the way the

 2   new definitions are created that that

 3   collaboration may be threatened.

 4         So I'm wondering if you are -- what

 5   you think about what's going on with the

 6   Centers of Excellence.

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So that's --

 8   it's -- I'm glad you raised that, because

 9   it's interesting, there was a study that was

10   done in the U.S. -- now, this is going back

11   maybe a decade, but the important thing is

12   that if you look at the places that are

13   thriving, they're characterized by a great

14   public university and a great private

15   university.

16         Think about RTP, you've got Duke and

17   North Carolina.   Think about L.A.   Think

18   about Berkeley in the Bay Area.    All those

19   places are characterized by that partnership

20   between a public and a private university.

21   So I think that whatever we can do to

22   maintain those partnerships is really, really

23   important.

24         I think the other thing with the
                                                      98

 1   Centers of Excellence and the Centers for

 2   Advanced Technology -- you know, there is a

 3   continuum of R&D development.   There's

 4   fundamental work that needs to go on -- the

 5   kind of work that won Stanley Whittingham the

 6   Nobel Prize in Chemistry this last year, to

 7   the actual implementation which may preserve

 8   civilization as we know it in terms of

 9   bringing grid-scale storage to bear, and the

10   continuum in between.

11         We have to support it all, because if

12   you just focus on the development and the

13   implementation, then you have eaten your seed

14   corn for the next generation of technologies

15   that are required, whether it's in drug

16   discovery or in IT or in energy.

17         So I think that we, you know, need to

18   be mindful that we need big R, little D,

19   reasonable size R, reasonable size D, and

20   then big D and little R.   And we need it all.

21   We can't ignore any of it.    So that would be

22   my comment.

23         SENATOR MAY:   Thank you.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 1         Assemblyman Pichardo.

 2         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Good morning.

 3         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Good morning.

 4   How are you?

 5         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Hi, how's it

 6   going, Chancellor?   Appreciate your time.

 7         To my colleagues, to the respective

 8   chairs, thank you for convening this hearing.

 9         So I want to add my voice to many of

10   my colleagues who have mentioned the issue of

11   the TAP gap.   I'll just sort of use a

12   football analogy -- we just had the

13   Super Bowl this Sunday -- it's like putting

14   up two brand-new goal posts but there's a

15   giant crater in the middle of the field and

16   we're asking our students to play around the

17   crater.

18         So we need to fill that gap, we need

19   to fill that hole, and we need to figure out

20   a better investment than upping the ante with

21   the Excelsior scholarship.    I think we need

22   to take care of those high-needs first and

23   then move forward.

24         But the thrust of my question -- I
                                                       100

 1   just want to make sure that this is

 2   mentioned, Madam Chancellor -- so there's a

 3   $600,000 decrease in the Graduate Diversity

 4   Fellowship, there is a $200,000 elimination

 5   of the SUNY Hispanic Leadership Institute,

 6   there's another $200,000 elimination of the

 7   SUNY Institute for Leadership and Diversity

 8   Inclusion.   And right now I know that you

 9   have made strides yourself to create a much

10   more diverse faculty and leadership within

11   the SUNY system.    So I don't understand, if

12   we're moving in a better direction, why does

13   the Executive see that it's necessary to cut

14   these programs when we need more support?

15         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Well, thank you

16   for the question.

17         Let me pick up on the first one that

18   you mentioned.   And that is something that,

19   you know, obviously I feel very passionate

20   about, and that is the support for our

21   graduate students and specifically our

22   Graduate Diversity Program.    You know, we

23   would be grateful to have those resources

24   restored.    And one of the reasons why is it's
                                                       101

 1   the same thing as the little R -- I mean, big

 2   R to little R and little D to big D.    It's --

 3   it's -- you need that whole continuum of the

 4   pipeline in education.

 5         So we're focused on PRODiG and trying

 6   to hire and diversify a thousand faculty over

 7   the next decade.   But where are they going to

 8   come from?   They're going to come from our

 9   graduate ranks.    So I'm so proud of our

10   comprehensive colleges, because they got

11   together as a sector and proposed a program

12   by which they would support -- well, working

13   together with us, we would support postdocs

14   and near-terminal-degree-ready graduate

15   students of color, and women in STEM, that

16   then could become the PRODiG faculty of

17   tomorrow.    And that's the beautiful thing

18   about taking a 10-year view of this.    Our

19   high school students today that we're

20   recruiting to our SUNY schools are the PRODiG

21   faculty of 2030.   So having these programs

22   where we can support the graduate students is

23   really, really critical.

24         And, you know, I was a graduate
                                                       102

 1   student.   I didn't have other means of

 2   support.   You know, frankly, in the Bay Area

 3   my stipend was less than the rent I had to

 4   pay.   So I had -- you know, that made it

 5   difficult.   I had to borrow money.    It was a

 6   challenging time.     So I'm, again, very

 7   sensitive.   I see these students, I want to

 8   increase their money.    I want to raise money,

 9   philanthropic resources.

10          One of the things that I talked about

11   in my State of the University System and that

12   I'm very passionate about, again, is going

13   back to entrepreneurship:    How are we going

14   to attract those students to stay and create

15   the companies here.    A lot of times it's the

16   postdocs and the graduate students of our

17   faculty members that want to be close to

18   their mentor, and they start their company

19   close to their university.

20          And so that's the kind of opportunity,

21   if we can give the kind of -- attract the

22   best and the brightest graduate students

23   here, as well as keep our rising seniors

24   thinking about going on to graduate school,
                                                        103

 1   it's that whole continuum that we have to be

 2   concerned about.

 3         So that's just one piece of the puzzle

 4   that you mentioned, and that is supporting

 5   our graduate students and particularly the

 6   Graduate Diversity Program.

 7         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:      I cannot

 8   emphasize this enough, that we need to make

 9   sure that we continue to support and fund

10   these programs to support the ability for

11   SUNY to continue to diversify.     So I know

12   that my colleagues here on both sides of the

13   aisle in the Legislature, that we'll continue

14   to support those programs.     But more

15   importantly --

16         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Thank you.

17         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:      You're welcome.

18         -- I just wanted to ask and mention

19   this about the FTE issue.     I had a meeting

20   with your equivalents at CUNY, and they

21   mentioned that there is a lack of enrollment

22   on the community college side.     So if we

23   maintain flat, it's an effective cut.

24         How exactly are we going to be dealing
                                                      104

 1   with the lack of enrollment if the FTE number

 2   stays flat at this point?

 3           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Right.   So I'm

 4   glad you mentioned that, because there's many

 5   sides to the enrollment story.

 6           One thing just to note is that we

 7   report head count.    We're going to start

 8   reporting also FTE at our state-operated.

 9   Our FTE has been flat if not slightly up.

10   It's our community colleges that in FTE are

11   down.   Also in head count, right?

12           So what we're going to do about that.

13   First of all, we know the demographics of the

14   State of New York has been declining in the

15   18-to-24-year-old, but we also know that the

16   demographics of the 24-to-44-year-old is

17   increasing.   And so that's with our real push

18   behind SUNY Online.

19           So right now there are 40,000 students

20   in the State of New York that are going

21   outside the State of New York for their

22   online education.    Well, that's crazy.

23   Especially when we have such outstanding

24   systems like CUNY, like SUNY and our
                                                            105

 1   privates.     We've got to capture that here

 2   because we want to keep those students here,

 3   thriving, and we also want to serve them.

 4   They are ours.

 5         So we're going to put a lot of effort

 6   into online.    And what we found out already,

 7   in a little pilot that we ran, is that the

 8   majority of those online students are in that

 9   demographic of the 24-to-44-year-old.       So

10   that's one of our strategies.

11         A second strategy is to be -- really

12   communicate more the value of a higher

13   education degree.    We know over the lifetime

14   of someone who has a degree versus someone

15   who doesn't, it's about a million bucks.         How

16   many people really know that?    How many

17   18-to-22-year-olds or 24-to-44-year-olds

18   really appreciate that?    So we have to do a

19   better job.

20         We've started a program which I give a

21   lot of credit to our CFO, Eileen McLoughlin,

22   who's behind me, which is financial

23   literacy -- teaching our students how not

24   only to manage money, but what their loans
                                                         106

 1   mean and how that they can pay them back and

 2   manage that.

 3         So a lot of this is putting in place

 4   the kind of services that will help our

 5   students be successful.    And that's really

 6   what we're passionate about.

 7         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:     Thank you.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 9         Senate.

10         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Senator Ken

11   LaValle.

12         SENATOR LaVALLE:     Chancellor, I'm

13   going to start with an easy question.    This

14   is your what time before this committee?

15         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Third, sir.

16         SENATOR LaVALLE:     Third time, good.    I

17   want to start with a SUNY hospital question.

18   Is there any operating deficits projected for

19   our hospitals?

20         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So our hospitals,

21   as I put it in the written testimony, provide

22   about 6 billion in economic activity.    About

23   2 million patient visits, 1.2 million

24   distinct patients visit.   There's Upstate,
                                                      107

 1   Downstate, Stony Brook.    The mix of Medicaid

 2   and Medicare at Upstate and Downstate is

 3   maybe -- I know Downstate is close to

 4   80 percent.    Upstate is -- I can get the

 5   number for you, but it's over 50 percent.

 6   And at Stony Brook it's about 50 percent.

 7         In terms of operations, I think

 8   Stony Brook is operating in the green, and we

 9   have some challenges at Downstate and Upstate

10   that we're working on in terms of being more

11   efficient.    And a lot of that has to do with

12   the facilities, which is why I'm so excited

13   that the -- in the Governor's budget there's

14   150 million for capital, 50 million for each

15   one of our hospitals.    So that was really

16   terrific.

17         And so we're -- but we've got great

18   leaders and we're working with the leaders

19   and we're making great strides.   These are

20   very important to the communities they reside

21   in, both as our safety-net hospitals but also

22   as our engines of economic activity.

23         SENATOR LaVALLE:     Have you had an

24   opportunity to visit our hospitals?
                                                       108

 1            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   I have, each one

 2   of them.    In fact, if I could just say one

 3   thing, we were just at Downstate last week.

 4   And I was -- it was amazing the care that

 5   they give.    They have about 1200 births a

 6   year, Stony Brook has over 4,000, Upstate

 7   about 1200 births.   To see the care in the

 8   infant NICU was amazing.   These are little --

 9   I mean, the kids would fit in your hands.

10   And the kind of care and dedication of that

11   team was phenomenal.

12            So I can't say enough about the work

13   that our hospitals and faculty and staff are

14   doing.    And, you know, it's also important

15   for the entire state.    I know you know this,

16   but one out of three nurses, one out of three

17   docs are educated at a SUNY.    And one out

18   of -- I think of eight licensed physicians in

19   the state are SUNY, and one out of five

20   dentists are educated in SUNY, and one out of

21   like seven, I think, are a licensed dentist.

22   Actually, no, it's more like one out of

23   eight.    So we're really important in terms of

24   the healthcare for all citizens.
                                                       109

 1           SENATOR LaVALLE:   I know you've been

 2   using a lot of superlatives to describe, you

 3   know, the hospitals.   And I don't think we

 4   spend enough letting the public know what we

 5   have and what we do at these great

 6   institutions.   As a matter of fact, even the

 7   campuses we don't really highlight -- because

 8   word of mouth is one of the best

 9   advertisements.   And so anyone who's gone to

10   a SUNY campus is always very proud and lets

11   the world know about their campus.

12           I also had a question that Senator

13   Stavisky had, dealing with our SUNY police.

14   So I just wanted to mention that, because

15   it's important that we continue to attract

16   and maintain people who keep our students

17   safe.

18           Going on to safety.   Suicides, number

19   of suicides in 2018-2019?

20           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   I can -- I can

21   get you that number.   I don't have that off

22   the top of my head.    Unfortunately, more than

23   one.

24           SENATOR LaVALLE:   I'm sorry, I
                                                      110

 1   couldn't hear that.

 2           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   I said

 3   unfortunately, more than one.   Even one would

 4   be too many.

 5           SENATOR LaVALLE:   You know, I've

 6   always -- and to this day -- feel mental

 7   health services are critically important.

 8   What are we doing to maintain and expand our

 9   mental health services?

10           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   I couldn't agree

11   more with you.   And that's why this fall I

12   established a Mental Health Wellness

13   Task Force led by Dr. Wayne Riley at

14   Downstate and also Dr. Deborah Stanley at

15   SUNY Oswego.   So they've been meeting often,

16   and I'll have a set of recommendations in the

17   spring.   That's the first thing.

18           The second thing is that we set up the

19   telecounseling mental health network with 10

20   campuses involved.    That was very well

21   received and supported by students, so we're

22   hoping that the funding will be restored with

23   that.

24           I will get back to the Senator about
                                                     111

 1   the number of mental healthcare professionals

 2   that we have on campus per student, so we'll

 3   come back to you with that.

 4         SENATOR LaVALLE:    Thank you.

 5         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     And that will

 6   inform what are the resources that we truly

 7   need to meet the needs.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 9         Assembly.

10         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Some time ago

11   we were joined by Assemblywoman Griffin, and

12   we go to Assemblywoman Bichotte for some

13   questions.

14         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:     Hello,

15   Chancellor.   Thank you for being here.

16         As you know, I'm a proud alum of

17   Buffalo State College and SUNY Buffalo.

18         I had a few questions.    First I want

19   to say that I'm really happy to see that some

20   of the programs have been maintained, like

21   CSTEP, HEOP, SEEK.   These are programs that

22   we've been fighting every year that's been

23   threatened to be decreased, so I'm happy that

24   they are maintaining their budget.
                                                     112

 1           I do have some concerns with the

 2   childcare centers being cut significantly,

 3   813,000.   Certainly we'd like to know the

 4   driving force of that.

 5           I do have some questions around TAP.

 6   You know, was TAP really having an enrollment

 7   problem?   It seems as if TAP is being

 8   decreased by over 10 percent.   And there has

 9   been -- has there been a corresponding fall

10   in the numbers of low-income students to

11   warrant this?    If anything, we should be

12   increasing the services for the number of

13   low-income students and their opportunities.

14           Can you give specifics on TAP

15   enrollments?    Is TAP making itself aware to

16   the population it's supposed to be working

17   with?   And all of this cut, again, is

18   addressing -- widening the TAP gap.     I

19   thought there was a commitment to narrow the

20   gap.

21           In addition to that, what percentage

22   of the TAP funds that are falling are going

23   to Dreamers?    And I'll stop here.

24           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Okay.   Well,
                                                       113

 1   thank you very much, and it's good to see you

 2   again as well.

 3         I'll have to get back to you on some

 4   of the specifics on TAP.   What I can tell you

 5   is that I know we have 100,000 students that

 6   are getting TAP.   The majority of those are

 7   full-time.    They're split about 60-40 between

 8   state-operated and community college.     I

 9   don't have the year-on-year number, so I will

10   get back to you on that.

11         We do have a TAP gap of about

12   82 million.    And as tuition went up this

13   year, that widened the gap.   I think last

14   year it was 60-some million, but the increase

15   in tuition created another gap.

16         So we would like to, you know, start

17   to narrow that gap.   So that would be

18   certainly something we would be supportive

19   of.

20         The other questions I'm --

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:       So is the

22   percentage of the TAP funds, the fall, are

23   they going to Dreamers?

24         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Oh.   So I don't
                                                        114

 1   have numbers on the Dreamers.   We don't keep

 2   that data.   So maybe I can find out if it's

 3   available, but we tend not to track DACA

 4   students.

 5         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:     With the

 6   enrollment increasing, why is the total of

 7   176 FTEs staying the same?    Why is that

 8   consistent and not increasing as well?

 9         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Right.   So our

10   enrollment in the state ops has been pretty

11   flat on an FTE basis.    I mean, it's slightly,

12   slightly, slightly up.    It's really, at the

13   community colleges, been in decline, both in

14   head count and FTE.   So that may be one of

15   the reasons there's a change in the TAP

16   students.    I'll have to look at it, and I'll

17   definitely get back to you.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:     Okay.   I know

19   you were very highly impressed with the

20   progress made in diversity leadership and the

21   target of increasing diversity in our faculty

22   and adjunct professors on the campus.

23         However, you know, I did have some

24   concerns with all of these programs being
                                                      115

 1   cut, these diversity programs being cut.

 2   And, you know, let's be honest, it's really a

 3   small, tiny amount, so why are we targeting

 4   these diversity programs that are servicing

 5   our students?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Yeah.   I think

 7   what I was really thrilled to see in the

 8   Governor's budget was the support for EOP and

 9   EOC and Attain.     So I thought that was just

10   really excellent.    And then the decrease in

11   the Graduate Diversity Fellowship is on a

12   base of, you know, 6.6 million, so it was a

13   decrease of 600,000.    And we would like to

14   ask to restore that, because I think it's

15   important, again, for that education

16   pipeline, to make sure that all along the way

17   that we increase our diversity.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:      Okay.

19   Speaking of diversity, I also saw that about

20   $1.4 billion is being allocated to SUNY

21   capital programs.    What's the percentage of

22   these capital programs going to be

23   MWBE-certified or be dedicated to MWBE

24   vendors?
                                                        116

 1         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Right.    So MWBE,

 2   we actually exceed the Governor's goal of

 3   30 percent.   So we will continue to keep our

 4   record, you know, really strong in that

 5   regard.   I think last year -- I'll get you

 6   the exact numbers, but it was over 30 percent

 7   went to MWBE contractors.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN BICHOTTE:    Over

 9   30 percent?

10         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Yeah.    Yes.

11         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

12         Senate?

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

14         I think I'm the closer, and then it

15   will be Toby Stavisky, second round.

16         So we talked about the fact that the

17   number of students getting TAP is actually

18   going down in SUNY.   We talked about the fact

19   that you, like many of us, are a big fan of

20   HEOP, EOP, other programs that are serving

21   exceptionally low income students with family

22   incomes of 15,000 to 21,000 and how valuable

23   a college degree is for exactly this

24   population.
                                                       117

 1         So you have fewer poor students coming

 2   to you.    Is it because they're not

 3   college-ready when they're getting out of our

 4   high schools, hence can never even get into

 5   the SUNY system?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So if I

 7   understand the question, are there students

 8   that are not graduating from our high schools

 9   college-ready?   Is that the question?

10         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Yeah.

11         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Certainly what we

12   see is there are a number of students that

13   need additional support to be college-ready.

14         The good news -- and again, this is

15   something that we've discovered in our pilots

16   and are very pleased with -- is that if you

17   set an expectation for success, students will

18   meet it.   You have to provide the resources

19   and the support, and we do do that through

20   the corequisite English and math programs

21   that are being pioneered not just at our

22   community colleges -- although the majority

23   at our community colleges -- but also at our

24   colleges of technologies as well as our
                                                         118

 1   comprehensives and university centers.

 2         So I think that we have, through -- we

 3   have an umbrella program for student success

 4   called SUNY Achieve, and that includes things

 5   like corequisite math and English.     So it's

 6   not remediation, but it's augmentation.     This

 7   works, and we're going to continue to really

 8   focus on it.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    So to follow

10   up -- actually, it was on Senator Jackson's

11   concern that because we fail to provide

12   adequate Foundation Aid funding for K-12, our

13   students aren't college-ready when they leave

14   school.   Do you actually know whether you're

15   seeing fewer poor students applying, or

16   you're just not letting them in?

17         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Oh, our

18   admission -- well, as you probably know, our

19   community colleges are open enrollment, so

20   all students are going to be admitted.      There

21   are admission criteria for the colleges of

22   technology and the comprehensives, but I'll

23   have to get back to you on just where those

24   admissions are.
                                                         119

 1          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Mm-hmm.    Okay.

 2          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   But we have a mix

 3   of -- and I think that's the strength of

 4   SUNY, is that we have a mix of -- I mean, if

 5   you look at the head of the EOC program in

 6   Rochester, Roosevelt started as getting his

 7   GED at the EOC.   And then he got his

 8   associate's and then he got his four-year and

 9   then he got his E.D.   Then he came back and

10   he's now the dean running that program.

11          You can start at SUNY and we will meet

12   you where you are and bring you along.

13          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   So looking at the

14   other side of the equation -- and we've had a

15   number of questions there around the

16   Governor's proposed expansion of the

17   Excelsior credit scholarship, so going from

18   125,000 to 150,000 in family income.

19          Do you know currently what percentage

20   of your students fall into the 125 to 150?      I

21   don't expect you to know it off the top of

22   your head, so probably get back to us.

23          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   We'll get back to

24   you.
                                                        120

 1           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    So the questions

 2   are what percentage of your students now are

 3   in the 125 to 150 population?    What

 4   percentage of them appear to have trouble

 5   finishing school within four years?      And

 6   what's the average student debt they're

 7   carrying when they end SUNY?

 8           Because I do think there's been quite

 9   a bit of questions about how does the state

10   prioritize those in greatest need.      And of

11   course it's both looking at can they get into

12   our schools, can they complete the work of

13   our schools, and what kind of debt they might

14   be carrying.

15           And we know the numbers for -- and the

16   issues for lowest-income, but these would, I

17   assume, fall into some of the higher-income

18   families that are throughout the SUNY system.

19           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    We'll get back to

20   you on that.   Thank you.

21           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    I appreciate

22   that.

23           And then also I know you partly

24   answered this question, but I'm not sure it
                                                         121

 1   was asked directly.    Do you agree with the

 2   independent colleges that this program

 3   specifically will lead to some of the smaller

 4   independent liberal arts colleges closing in

 5   this state?

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I haven't really

 7   focused on that, just because I'm -- you

 8   know, let's just say I have all I can say

 9   grace over at the public sphere.      And I don't

10   mean to be flip about that at all, but I

11   really haven't looked at it and I haven't

12   seen the data.   But again, we're happy to

13   have a conversation.   Let's -- we can put the

14   data out and just see what really is going

15   on.

16         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Okay.   Thank you.

17         Assembly.

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We go to

19   Assemblyman Stirpe.

20         ASSEMBLYMAN STIRPE:     Good morning.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Good morning.

22         ASSEMBLYMAN STIRPE:     Thanks for being

23   here and addressing all our questions.

24         I have a question from one of my
                                                         122

 1   colleagues that I'm supposed to carry to you,

 2   and it involves the new STEAM regional high

 3   school that was approved in Syracuse.    And

 4   it's sort of been changed a little bit; now

 5   it also includes workforce development.       And

 6   she wants to know how that will affect the

 7   Syracuse EOC, which is one block away from

 8   that potential new school.

 9         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Right.   So I

10   think that there's a natural synergy between

11   the EOC -- again, if we look at that

12   pipeline, high school students could go to

13   the EOC, could get particular training around

14   workforce development.   Right now they're

15   not -- they're near each other, but they're

16   not collocated, so it would be interesting to

17   see how this evolves.    And we'll do whatever

18   we can in support from SUNY to make it

19   successful.

20         I think that that's -- I had a chance

21   in the fall to go up to the central region

22   and sit down and spend time with five of our

23   SUNY presidents as well as the head of

24   economic development in that area, and
                                                     123

 1   learned that there are something like

 2   5,000 unfilled skilled jobs.

 3         So, you know, I think the exciting

 4   thing about what SUNY can do is that you

 5   could actually, using machine learning, sit

 6   down and say okay, what's the criteria that

 7   these jobs are needed, what are the skill

 8   sets, what's the skill set of the resumes of

 9   the individuals who aspire and want to be in

10   that industry, and then figure out for each

11   particular job what's the skills that are

12   needed and point that individual to a SUNY

13   class, a microcredential, vocational

14   training, EOC or some other program that we

15   can develop and provide.   That's what

16   individualized learning is about.      That's

17   where we need to focus going forward.

18         So I'm excited about that, and

19   working -- we will work and do whatever we

20   can, as SUNY, to support those efforts.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN STIRPE:      Okay.   In the

22   beginning of your tenure you came around and

23   visited all the regions and talked about some

24   of your goals.   And one of the big ones was
                                                      124

 1   around research dollars, and especially AI.

 2   And can you talk about what's happened in the

 3   last few years and where some of this

 4   research might be going on right now?

 5         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Sure.

 6   Absolutely.   We have seen an increase year

 7   over year in our research expenditures by

 8   $136 million.   And a lot of that is focusing

 9   on -- and this is really the great work of

10   Senior Vice Chancellor Grace Wang, who's

11   sitting behind me, and her team and the

12   RF Foundation and our colleagues.

13         So it's really being cognizant about

14   where is the future of the future of work?

15   What's the kind of research and development

16   that our students need to go through in terms

17   of training to be ready to go into those

18   industries?   Then what are the -- you know,

19   if you look at where research is going --

20   when I started out a long time ago, it was

21   one professor and a few students working in a

22   lab on your own.   Then we evolved into groups

23   where you get -- you know, maybe if you're a

24   chemist you invite a physicist over for
                                                      125

 1   coffee and maybe work together.   Then we had

 2   these larger interdisciplinary programs, and

 3   I ran one in Colorado which was in optical

 4   AI.   So it was chemists and physicists and

 5   engineers, psychologists, cognitive

 6   neuroscientists working together to figure

 7   out how could we built smarter, faster,

 8   better computers that emulate the

 9   organizational properties of the human brain.

10   Right?    Well, that's really kind of what AI

11   is today.

12            The problem was when we were doing

13   that 30 years ago, we didn't have the sensors

14   and the computational power because Moore's

15   Law hadn't continued on for 30 years to where

16   we are today, which is sort of done.    But

17   wow, you know, a thousand times -- on every

18   single dimension -- better.    Now we have the

19   capability to actually design the kind of

20   programs I talked about to do that career

21   matching with the vocation and the avocation

22   of every student.

23            And I have to say just one little

24   quote by Mark Twain {sic} which I think
                                                        126

 1   brings it all together, "Two Tramps in Mud

 2   Time":     When you can bring an avocation and a

 3   vocation together like two eyes in sight,

 4   that's what our goal is.    And we have now the

 5   capability and the desire to do that.

 6            So we started a new center in AI at

 7   Stony Brook, we have a center in AI up in

 8   Buffalo.     Grace Wang, Dr. Wang, is

 9   coordinating all the AI activities across all

10   of SUNY.     And the way that we're increasing

11   our research expenditures is to be able to

12   develop group multidisciplinary and now

13   convergent research where you're really like

14   a partner in the labs.    You get rid of the

15   ego, and you work together for the greater

16   purpose.     That's why we're being successful,

17   in my opinion.     We'll do 1.7 billion in

18   research expenditures this year.     I want to

19   get to 2 billion.

20            ASSEMBLYMAN STIRPE:   Great, thank you.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Thank you.

22            Senate?

23            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Thank you.

24            Toby Stavisky to close for the Senate.
                                                        127

 1           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Real quick, let me

 2   just follow up with some of the questions.

 3   The Higher Ed Committee in the Senate held

 4   hearings throughout the state, there were six

 5   of them, in the fall.     And the students, I

 6   must tell you, I think were the stars.     And

 7   many of them talked about the mental health

 8   issues that were discussed here today.     And

 9   in fact, as you know, the recommended ratio

10   is about one counselor for every thousand

11   students.

12           You said you didn't -- weren't sure of

13   the ratio, but let me ask you if you have any

14   idea of the waiting time.     The students spoke

15   about long waits for counseling.

16           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    It's too long.

17   It's too long.

18           SENATOR STAVISKY:   One other --

19           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    But I'll quantify

20   that.   But I know from talking with some of

21   the students it's too long.

22           SENATOR STAVISKY:   And I know you have

23   your task force with two of your experts, and

24   we await what they say.
                                                       128

 1         One other quick question.      What has

 2   been the enrollment projection -- what are

 3   the enrollment projections for the future for

 4   the four-year -- I know a lot depends on the

 5   economy, obviously -- but the four-year and

 6   the community colleges?

 7         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So our four-year

 8   colleges are pretty steady.   And where we're

 9   seeing the decrease is in the community

10   colleges, in part because our economy has

11   been growing, on average, 2 percent a year.

12   We have a very low unemployment rate.

13         So what we are putting in place, three

14   or four -- actually, six different

15   strategies.   And this is the great work by

16   our still fairly new provost, Dr. Tod

17   Lauersen.

18         SENATOR STAVISKY:    He is, I must tell

19   you, very responsive in many ways.

20         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Terrific.

21         SENATOR STAVISKY:    It's appreciated.

22         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So we are looking

23   at many different strategies.   One is the

24   individualized learning.   So it's the
                                                      129

 1   Re-enroll to Complete, it's the corequisite

 2   English and math, it's reducing the cost of

 3   our textbooks, it's bringing financial

 4   literacy to our students.

 5         Then there's the research and

 6   innovation and the apprenticeships and

 7   internships.    I think when you create the

 8   opportunity for our students to learn, how to

 9   apply what they're learning in the classroom

10   in a real world environment, they get turned

11   on, they get super excited.    And then that

12   also helps with completion.

13         And then the emphasis on

14   entrepreneurship, sustainability,

15   partnerships.    I mean, this is all part of

16   the ecosystem that we're trying to put

17   together to, you know, create that student

18   success program.

19         SENATOR STAVISKY:     Thank you.     And

20   your stability programs have really -- I hope

21   are going to be very successful.    Thank you.

22         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thank you.

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

24         Assembly.
                                                          130

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 2   Assemblywoman Griffin.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:    Good morning,

 4   Chancellor.

 5           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Good morning.

 6           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:    As a SUNY

 7   graduate, I am grateful for the success and

 8   continued growth of SUNY.     But I do have a

 9   couple of questions.

10           I was wondering, are there statistics

11   available to show geographic usage of the

12   Excelsior Scholarship Program?

13           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I'm sure there

14   are.    I don't know them off the top of my

15   head.

16           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:    You know, I'd

17   be very interested if we could get a

18   breakdown by Assembly and Senate district,

19   because I think it's important to know.       Like

20   in my district, a lot of people can't use it,

21   aren't using it, find there's challenges with

22   it.    So it would be important to have those

23   numbers to see the success.     You know, are a

24   lot of people using it would mean a lot,
                                                       131

 1   especially that we're expanding it at this

 2   point.

 3            My other question is I understand that

 4   community colleges are experiencing a massive

 5   reduction in enrollment directly related to

 6   these Excelsior scholarships.    And as a

 7   result, you know, they are experiencing

 8   various decreases in their funding.

 9            So what is being done to address this

10   impact, and how is this underusage impacting

11   taxpayers?

12            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So I mentioned

13   earlier in the testimony, we have about

14   24,000 students between SUNY and CUNY that

15   are attending on Excelsior.    It's not clear

16   that there's massive decreases in the

17   community college due to Excelsior, so I

18   think that we really need to look at the data

19   there to see.

20            When you consider that we have about

21   200,000 students attending community college,

22   I'm not sure that the decreases that we're

23   seeing would be attributed to that.    I think

24   more what I would say in our community

 1   colleges, if you plot the decrease in

 2   population over the last year, the slope went

 3   a little sharper.   We're running into a time

 4   when the population is experiencing an even

 5   bigger decline, and that's borne out by I

 6   think in the last maybe four years, we've had

 7   a net loss of about a million -- maybe it's a

 8   little longer period of time, but just

 9   particularly decreasing right now.

10         So what we're doing is we're putting

11   in place a number of different programs in

12   order to recapture those students.   Like the

13   one I mentioned, Re-enroll to Complete, which

14   returned 8,000 students who had dropped out.

15   And we got them back before their federal

16   loans came due so that they now can complete

17   their degree and then garner the type of

18   salary that will help them repay.

19         So we're putting together a -- you

20   know, I would say a multiprong -- we have put

21   together a multiprong strategic approach to

22   the enrollment which I think will really help

23   our community colleges.

24         So, you know, when we think about the
                                                       133

 1   success of Excelsior -- and we'll get the

 2   breakout -- if you think about the majority

 3   of the students going to community colleges

 4   that are on Excelsior are retained at

 5   20 percent higher than non-Excelsior, it's

 6   working.

 7         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:     Right.

 8         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Now, I'm not

 9   saying that anything is perfect.    But I

10   think, you know, it would be good to get the

11   data and to see, you know, are there

12   particular places where it could work better.

13   So we'll do that.

14         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:     Yeah, I know I

15   represent -- a lot of my constituents go to

16   Nassau Community College, which is a very

17   large community college.   But they are

18   struggling with their finances as a result.

19         And quickly, I just wanted to echo the

20   comments on the TAP gap.   Of course, you

21   know, I'd really love to be able to resolve

22   that because I think our independent and

23   private colleges are very important to every

24   community in New York State.    I happen to
                                                        134

 1   have Molloy College in my community, and I

 2   know a lot of constituents use that

 3   university.

 4           Mental health, I echo the support for

 5   much more to be done for mental health for

 6   students.

 7           And then also the university police

 8   officers.   I know there's a little bit of a

 9   challenge with the attrition rate with the

10   university police officers, and I wondered

11   have you met with the New York State PBA to

12   see what can be done about that attrition

13   rate?

14           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Well, they

15   haven't contacted me, but I would be

16   delighted to meet and to talk about it.      But

17   I wasn't aware of any large attrition rate,

18   so.

19           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:   Oh, okay.

20   Yeah, they are -- they report to me that it

21   was a 30 percent attrition rate, so they

22   are -- that's a concern to them, yeah.

23           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Is that from one

24   particular campus or overall?    That seems
                                                        135

 1   high.

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:    I believe

 3   that's from all.

 4            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thirty percent.

 5   Hmm.     Okay.   Well, we'll look at it.

 6            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:    Okay, thank

 7   you so much.

 8            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     By the way,

 9   Nassau Community College, you have a great

10   new president there, so we're really excited

11   about {inaudible} Dr. Williams --

12            (Overtalk.)

13            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GRIFFIN:     Yeah, really

14   great, it seems like he'll be a fantastic

15   proposition.     Thank you so much.

16            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     You bet.

17            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

18   Since the Senate doesn't have any more

19   questioners, we go to Alicia Hyndman.

20            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Thank you,

21   Chair Weinstein.

22            Thank you, Chancellor, and thank you

23   to your team.     I know you don't do this

24   alone.
                                                       136

 1         So I am in agreement with my

 2   colleagues; I fully support TAP gap.    And I

 3   have my comments on Excelsior, which most of

 4   my colleagues said.

 5         I wanted to talk about OER, because

 6   you mentioned it in your report.    You said

 7   over 59 campuses are utilizing it and it's

 8   been a savings of about -- or reduced

 9   textbook costs of 47 million.   Do you have a

10   breakdown per campus?

11         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    We can get that

12   for you.

13         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Okay.   So from

14   the research that we've found, a lot of

15   required textbooks that are in or available

16   in OER are from professors that are teaching

17   in SUNY.   Are you aware of that?   And a lot

18   of the books that they're also using are also

19   recommended by some of their colleagues.

20         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    So I can

21   certainly look at that.   It's not unusual to

22   have a professor write a textbook, especially

23   when they're a leader in their particular

24   field, and then have the students use it.
                                                        137

 1   But --

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   I know.

 3            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   Yeah.   But I'll

 4   look into it.

 5            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   Is there a way

 6   you can ensure that more resources or more

 7   textbooks that are not by college

 8   professors are available in OER?

 9            CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So generally the

10   textbooks that are written for college are

11   written by college professors.     But there are

12   other materials that are available that --

13   that's I think one of the things we're trying

14   to put in place with OER that has saved our

15   students 47 million bucks over three years,

16   is equivalent materials, maybe materials that

17   are prepared -- you know, as a former

18   professor myself, I know that I did often

19   prepare my own materials and then provide

20   them to the class, and that's what we see our

21   professors doing as well.

22            There are some times when a particular

23   textbook is sort of, you know, the standard

24   of that particular course.     Sometimes it's
                                                        138

 1   developed by someone at the particular

 2   college, sometimes it's at another

 3   university.   So our goal is to keep cost of

 4   textbooks low independent of, you know, who

 5   wrote or provided them for our students.     And

 6   I think that we're making a lot of great

 7   headway there, so we'll continue to be

 8   vigilant.

 9         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    I'm glad

10   New York State is using it, because as a

11   parent of a child who's in college, once

12   everything's paid, the tuition and the

13   housing, then comes the textbooks.    And I'm

14   always looking for -- she's always looking

15   for ways to cut down costs.

16         With telehealth, is that occurring

17   now, or is that something that you're looking

18   at doing?

19         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     It is occurring

20   now, and it started a couple of years ago.

21   We are, I believe, in our second year, and

22   we've expanded it to 10 campuses.    And it's

23   being run by psychiatrists from our Upstate

24   Medical University, where students at these
                                                         139

 1   10 campuses can call and make an appointment

 2   and then get help.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    How do you

 4   know if that's successful?      And how many

 5   campuses does SUNY have, and you're only

 6   using it at 10 right now?

 7           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     So there's 10,

 8   and we're hoping, with -- you know, to

 9   restore the funding so that we can look at

10   expanding.   So we would love to expand that

11   opportunity for all of our students.

12           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Okay.    Thank

13   you.

14           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thank you.

15           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     So we go now to

16   Assemblywoman Simon.

17           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Am I on?     This

18   little red light doesn't really light up very

19   well.

20           Thank you, Chair Weinstein and

21   Senator Krueger and Chancellor.

22           I have a couple of questions.      You

23   know, I want to sort of just add my voice to

24   the concerns about the TAP gap.     It is a
                                                         140

 1   persistent problem that's only getting worse.

 2   And we have to find some way of addressing

 3   this issue, and we need somebody -- we need

 4   to put our heads together and figure this

 5   out.

 6           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Right.   Right.

 7           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   I'm also

 8   concerned about the kind of separation

 9   that -- we address this issue of the

10   Excelsior Scholarship Program, but we're not

11   addressing the other issues that students

12   face.   So, for example, the problem with

13   books, transportation, food insecurity.      It's

14   nice that we have food pantries on campus,

15   but we really shouldn't have to have food

16   pantries on campus.   We shouldn't be putting

17   our students in a position where they are

18   food-insecure because their tuition is going

19   up.

20           And I think that it's an issue that I

21   think is a big problem in higher education,

22   it's a big problem in New York State.     And it

23   seems to me that the way we are addressing

24   the increase in tuition and not addressing
                                                     141

 1   these other issues that go hand in hand with

 2   trying to make our schools more accessible to

 3   people who need that education so we can move

 4   them forward -- we're kind of just dancing

 5   around this.

 6         And so I'm curious what, if anything,

 7   SUNY is doing to look differently at this

 8   situation and come up with a way that perhaps

 9   through varied policies we can start tackling

10   this issue on the ground in the way that

11   students are experiencing it.

12         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Yup.   Well,

13   absolutely.    And we look forward to working

14   with you during the next few months in the

15   legislative session to see about coming up

16   with ways to address this.

17         I think one of the things that we're

18   doing internally is looking at efficiencies

19   of scale.   I know I already said it once,

20   maybe I said it twice, but there are ways

21   that we believe, through the print initiative

22   that our CFO is leading, that we can take

23   some costs out of SUNY which then will allow

24   us to put the resources into the academic end
                                                      142

 1   and the other resources that we need for our

 2   students.

 3         And that's not an insignificant amount

 4   of money we think we can recapture for the

 5   campuses.   So I think it's, you know, looking

 6   at making sure that we don't waste anything,

 7   whether it's food, whether it's water,

 8   whether it's energy, whether it's our other

 9   resources, so that we're great stewards of

10   the taxpayer dollars.

11         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Another question

12   I have is about students with disabilities.

13   There has not been an increase in the

14   per-capita rate that is paid or allocated for

15   students in about 30 years.   And clearly the

16   cost of serving students with disabilities is

17   greater.

18         And we are happy that we have more and

19   more students with disabilities taking part

20   in the education in New York State, but we

21   are really undercutting the ability of our

22   SUNY campuses to provide for their needs so

23   that they can graduate and -- because we're

24   just not funding that.   And so everything is
                                                        143

 1   on a shoestring.   And I'm curious what your

 2   office is doing to help think through a way

 3   that we can address that issue.

 4         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So we do know

 5   that we have at least 32,000 students,

 6   probably around 32,000 students with

 7   disabilities, of which about 22,000 of those

 8   are neurodevelopmental, so whether it's ADHD,

 9   autism and other issues.

10         So we are working with those students

11   day in and day out to have them become

12   successful.   We have resources on our

13   campuses to provide support.    In fact, I

14   think we -- we can get you some numbers

15   because recently we looked at what are we

16   spending on and allocating to help all of our

17   students be successful, particularly students

18   with disabilities.   So I'll get back to you

19   on that.

20         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:     Okay.   Because

21   it may be staffing issues as well, there's

22   not enough staff to go around.

23         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Yup, it could be.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:     That's a big
                                                       144

 1   issue on these campuses, as well as

 2   technological advances.

 3           And then one other issue I'd like to

 4   address is our schools of education, and SUNY

 5   has a number of schools of education.     And

 6   the issues that have been raised with

 7   students who need remedial work and the

 8   education that we're giving our kids from

 9   K-12.

10           (Protestors chanting in background.)

11           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   Okay.   And the

12   issues about adequate teacher preparation,

13   that our schools are not teaching our

14   teachers how to teach reading and if

15   scientific ways that we know are the -- that

16   we know are validated.    And it seems to me

17   that this all feeds into this problem.

18           And I would like to talk about what it

19   is the SUNY schools are doing in their

20   colleges of education to change that picture.

21           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Okay.   And I'll

22   come back to you.   I know we have 16 or 17

23   colleges of education.    So we can certainly

24   get you the information.
                                                           145

 1           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Okay, thank you.

 2           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thank you.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Appreciate it.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 5           We go to Assemblyman Ra.

 6           ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Good morning,

 7   Chancellor.

 8           So I just wanted to go back to

 9   Excelsior and TAP.   How many students have

10   applied to Excelsior last year and how many

11   are receiving awards under Excelsior?

12           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     I think the

13   number in SUNY is 20,000 are receiving

14   awards.   I'm not sure how many applied, but I

15   could ask -- {inaudible exchange}.

16           We'll get back to you on that.       I know

17   for sure, though, at least 20,000 are at

18   SUNY.   Which is a 20 percent raise over the

19   year before.

20           ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Okay.   So really my

21   question, then, is when we look at -- I mean,

22   any student that we can help go to school and

23   alleviate, you know, the debt issue and all

24   of that is a good thing.   But when we look at
                                                        146

 1   the students impacted by the program, by

 2   Excelsior, versus TAP, which we haven't, you

 3   know, modernized in years in terms of income

 4   levels and everything, I guess my question is

 5   if we -- you know, in an ideal world we would

 6   fund all of these things.     But if we are

 7   going to put, you know, a set of resources of

 8   whatever it is, doesn't it make more sense to

 9   put it towards TAP, which gives those

10   students, you know, the opportunity to go to

11   school, pick where they want to go?       And it

12   seemingly, to me, impacts a lot more

13   students.

14         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      So we'll come

15   back to you on the numbers and just look at,

16   you know, how many students would be impacted

17   potentially with this change.     We'll

18   definitely get back to you.     I don't know

19   those numbers right now.

20         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Okay.

21         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      What I will

22   say -- and again, I know you all know this --

23   our ability for offering students TAP support

24   coming from families with incomes of less
                                                       147

 1   than 80,000, Excelsior -- and I know you know

 2   this -- was provided to hit the next tranche.

 3   You know, the 80 to the 125.    And now the

 4   Governor is looking at the 125 to 150.    So

 5   that is a different segment of the population

 6   for sure.

 7         I think that with the campuses

 8   providing the TAP gap, any relief on that

 9   would be very much appreciated and would help

10   the campuses tremendously.     So we'll look

11   forward to working with you to see what we

12   can come up with.   I think I've heard pretty

13   clearly that's something that would be a good

14   thing for all of us to think about.

15         ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   And then just as --

16   and, you know, I don't necessarily expect you

17   to have this information right now, but with

18   following up on the number of applications.

19   If you can provide any information regarding,

20   you know, students that are applying or maybe

21   losing it because they have to drop a class

22   or -- you know, because we know that the

23   stringent requirements of Excelsior have, you

24   know, caused some issues with students.    I've
                                                      148

 1   had constituents who I've worked with to try

 2   to get hardships and stuff, who have had

 3   illnesses that have come up, you know, family

 4   situations that are have come up.

 5          And I think that, you know, that has

 6   been a source of frustration for many who

 7   otherwise would qualify and get an award that

 8   obviously would be a financial benefit to

 9   them and their families but have, for

10   whatever reason, not been able to meet that

11   requirement.    I know we have a little more

12   flexibility than we perhaps had initially

13   with this, but I think that's something we

14   need to look at as we're looking at

15   expansions, is making sure that this is

16   available to as many students as possible

17   who, you know, may have something come up,

18   through no fault of their own, that makes

19   them not eligible for those very stringent

20   requirements.

21          CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Agreed.   Thank

22   you.

23          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

24          We go to our final questioner,
                                                        149

 1   Assemblywoman Glick, for a second round.

 2           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you very

 3   much.

 4           Not to belabor it, but just to make

 5   clear, Excelsior is the last dollar.     So

 6   students who have TAP, Pell, can apply if

 7   they can meet those 30 credits a year, and it

 8   makes up for the difference.     That delta, you

 9   know, eats up their Pell so they don't have

10   money for books, transportation and the like.

11           So it is clearly intended, as you say,

12   to hit the higher income bracket, and those

13   are kids who perhaps have sufficient support

14   to ensure that they have family support that

15   makes it easier for them.     They may not have

16   to have a job in order to go to school.

17   That's not your -- I know they need to reset

18   the timer -- that -- so I'll just continue.

19           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:    Yeah, go ahead.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    On the STEM

21   scholarship, we had a bill that got vetoed,

22   because we wanted to make a change.    If you

23   have a STEM scholarship, it's like Excelsior,

24   but you have to graduate in the top
                                                      150

 1   10 percent of your class.   You don't have

 2   that requirement from Excelsior.

 3         If you are in that top 10 percent,

 4   you're pursuing STEM, we tried and had vetoed

 5   the work requirement for the years after in

 6   that specific field, because we had students

 7   from largely upstate who said they wanted to

 8   go home, but they couldn't get a job in that

 9   specific field.   So it converts to a loan.

10         So what happens is now you're coming

11   from a family that maybe makes $50,000, you

12   worked hard, you got your scholarship, and

13   now you find out that you can't get a job in

14   Malone, so it turns into a loan.   And now you

15   have a loan, you don't have the job prospects

16   in your area where you wanted to live, so now

17   you move to Boston, where you can perhaps get

18   a job in the field that you studied.

19         So you're talking about the advisement

20   that helps students make good choices.   And

21   it seems to me clearly there have been some

22   students who have made -- you know, they

23   believed our rhetoric that these are the jobs

24   of the future, but the future hasn't arrived
                                                       151

 1   in a lot of places.   And so now we have lost

 2   a kid who graduated in the top 10 percent,

 3   focused on STEM.   And somehow we've got other

 4   kids who come from families with higher

 5   incomes who don't have the same work

 6   requirement, and they go home and do flower

 7   arrangements with mom and they stay in the

 8   state, but they're not necessarily the kids

 9   that we were hoping to support.

10           So what is SUNY going to do to make

11   certain that we don't have any more kids

12   talking to their representative, who then

13   talks to me about this problem in terms of

14   matching students with what is actually

15   available should they actually want to return

16   home?

17           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:   So I think that

18   one of the things that I'm very, very focused

19   on is increasing the number of

20   internships and apprenticeships for our

21   students so that they don't have to make

22   those choices that you're talking about.    And

23   one of the things is -- you know, I always

24   think about Excelsior is one of the tools in
                                                        152

 1   the toolbox.    TAP's another one.   Pell

 2   grants.    All -- we need to increase the

 3   number of fellowships and scholarships to

 4   give a broader set of choices and

 5   opportunities for our students, without a

 6   doubt.

 7            The second thing is I think we are

 8   making inroads on using the strength and the

 9   quality of our SUNY schools to attract

10   industries that then provide those

11   internships.    To give an example, Cree.   Cree

12   is going to invest a billion dollars --

13   Empire State Development and the state is

14   going to invest funding as well to attract

15   them -- to put a major silicon carbide fab

16   next to SUNY Poly in Utica that will create

17   600-some careers -- not just jobs, but

18   careers, a lot of overnight jobs.    But

19   they're already hiring our students for those

20   summer internship programs.

21            So I think it's that marrying of the

22   opportunity for our companies that need a

23   talented workforce and skilled workforce to

24   meet with our campuses, develop the kind of
                                                       153

 1   curricula and programs, create those summer

 2   opportunity programs.

 3            And so one of the things that we're

 4   going to do is invest in a position where we

 5   actually really help Senior Vice Chancellor

 6   Johanna Duncan-Poitier and Senior Vice

 7   Chancellor Grace Wang go out and develop more

 8   of those kind of partnerships.     I mean,

 9   that's really what it's going to take.

10            And we've been successful at doing

11   that.    We have many of these companies.    We

12   just need another order of magnitude and

13   scale.    So we need to put some more resources

14   into it, and that's what we're going to do.

15            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   For the cost of

16   accommodation, what is the need, do you

17   think, for students who have disabilities,

18   especially if we're going -- you know, we

19   have a lot of outreach to veterans and stuff,

20   and there's a range of accommodations that

21   are needed.    And I've been to some schools

22   where they say they just have to do some

23   really basic things like widen areas so that

24   people in wheelchairs can get through.
                                                           154

 1           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Sure, yeah.     You

 2   know, I can come back to you on the number of

 3   projects that we're doing throughout SUNY.        I

 4   do know we have 32,000 students that are

 5   coming to SUNY, which I'm so proud of that we

 6   have this opportunity for all students to be

 7   successful here.    We can break it down by

 8   campus and we can look at the kind of

 9   projects and investment that we're doing to

10   accommodate.

11           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    That's very

12   helpful.   Thank you so much, and thank you

13   for your very responsive answers.

14           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     Thank you very

15   much.

16           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    So, Chancellor,

17   thank you so much for being here.     We look

18   forward to having some of the follow-up

19   answers that members have asked for.      And

20   look forward to continuing to work with you

21   as we go forward.    Thank you so much.

22           CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:     And I with you.

23           Thank you all very much.    Thanks so

24   much for your interest and for your support.
                                                       155

 1   It means the world to us.   As I said when I

 2   started, we got momentum.

 3         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     And for your

 4   endurance.

 5         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

 6         CHANCELLOR JOHNSON:      Thank you all.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     So next we'll

 8   have Felix Rodriguez, the chancellor of the

 9   City University of New York.    We'll just give

10   people a couple of moments to stretch their

11   legs and leave as we wait for the chancellor.

12         (Pause.)

13         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     If we can

14   settle down.   And the people who are leaving,

15   if you could leave, because the voices carry.

16         So, Chancellor, feel free to begin.

17         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Thank you.

18         Good morning, buenos dias, Chairs

19   Krueger, Weinstein, Stavisky and Glick and

20   members of the Senate Finance, Assembly Ways

21   and Means and the Senate and Assembly Higher

22   Education Committees, staff and guests.      My

23   name is Felix Matos Rodriguez, chancellor of

24   the City University of New York.
                                                       156

 1         I am joined this morning by Executive

 2   Vice Chancellor and University Provost Jose

 3   Luis Cruz, and Senior Vice Chancellor and our

 4   Chief Financial Officer Matthew Sapienza.

 5         I am now in my tenth month as

 6   chancellor, so this is my first appearance to

 7   provide testimony before this body.   For

 8   those of you who do not know me, I am a

 9   historian by training and started my CUNY

10   career 20 years ago as a professor at Hunter

11   College and director of its Center for Puerto

12   Rican Studies.    I later served for five years

13   as the president of Hostos Community College

14   and then five years as president of

15   Queens College.

16         After two decades in a variety of

17   roles on several CUNY campuses, I am honored

18   to oversee the premier and largest urban

19   public university in the United States,

20   serving half a million students, 20,000

21   faculty and 25,000 staff at our 11 four-year

22   colleges, seven community colleges, and seven

23   graduate and professional schools.

24         On behalf of the entire CUNY
                                                     157

 1   community, I want to thank Governor Cuomo,

 2   the State Senate, and the State Assembly for

 3   your past support, which has enabled CUNY to

 4   deliver strong results for our students and

 5   the citizens of New York.

 6         I am pleased to share with you some of

 7   our important recent achievements and to

 8   outline our priorities, plans and goals for

 9   the coming fiscal year and beyond.

10         In my first year as chancellor, I have

11   built an exceptional leadership team of

12   experienced and diverse professionals who

13   mirror the students and the city we serve.

14   In addition to the two members of my

15   leadership team sitting here, let me

16   introduce you to two other members who are

17   here today.   Sitting in the audience are

18   Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Operating

19   Officer Hector Batista, and Senior Vice

20   Chancellor and Special Counsel Glenda Grace.

21         My administration will also have the

22   rare opportunity to shape the future of CUNY

23   leadership for years to come.   We have nine

24   presidential vacancies, and yesterday I named
                                                       158

 1   the first of those nine:    The Board of

 2   Trustees approved a new president for Baruch

 3   College, Dr. David Wu, currently the provost

 4   and executive vice president of George Mason

 5   University.    Dr. Wu is an accomplished

 6   scholar who makes history by becoming the

 7   first Asian-American president of a CUNY

 8   school.     I expect to make about half a dozen

 9   presidential appointments this year.

10         At a time of growing inequality, CUNY

11   has become a national leader in promoting

12   upward social and economic mobility.    In

13   2019, six CUNY colleges placed in the top 25

14   nationally on collegeNET's 2019 Social

15   Mobility Index, with Baruch College ranking

16   number one for a fifth straight year.      CUNY

17   also dominated both the Forbes and Wall

18   Street Journal's "best-value" college

19   rankings.

20         Our history of delivering

21   high-quality, affordable education and

22   promoting social mobility help explain why

23   freshman enrollment rose 3 percent this past

24   fall, countering the national trend.    It was
                                                      159

 1   part of a 17 percent increase since 2010 -- a

 2   decade in which freshman enrollment for both

 3   public and private universities nationwide

 4   remained largely flat.

 5         Also in my first year we made a vital

 6   investment in the future with our historic

 7   agreement with our largest union, the

 8   Professional Staff Congress, which provided

 9   well-earned increases for our faculty and,

10   perhaps most notably, reaffirmed the

11   importance of adjunct faculty -- not only

12   with substantial pay increases, but with

13   provisions that advanced our efforts to

14   further integrate them into academic and

15   campus life.    With these advances, we are

16   blazing a trail for higher education

17   nationwide.

18         We have also started to identify key

19   priority areas that establish a foundation

20   for a bold vision for CUNY over the next

21   10 years.   We will be laying out our ideas in

22   the coming year with input from all our

23   stakeholders.    But even before then, we will

24   get a head start with moves that increase our
                                                     160

 1   focus on pedagogy and improve the craft of

 2   teaching, and others that expand

 3   career-engagement initiatives so that CUNY

 4   students have the same opportunities for

 5   internships and career paths that young

 6   people from more affluent families have.

 7         We are pleased that the Governor's

 8   Executive Budget includes an increase of

 9   $24.3 million in funding for employee fringe

10   benefits and continues current-year funding

11   levels for our critical Opportunity Programs,

12   SEEK and College Discovery.   The budget

13   proposal also continues to include $4 million

14   for Open Educational Resources, which is

15   funding that we have leveraged to

16   significantly reduce the costs of textbooks

17   for our students.   Our students saved

18   $49 million in textbook costs from 2017 to

19   2019, which amounts to students saving $7 for

20   every $1 invested by the State of New York.

21         We are also grateful that the

22   Executive Budget proposes to raise the

23   income-eligibility cap for the Excelsior

24   Scholarship and that it would make more
                                                      161

 1   community college students eligible for

 2   Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

 3   benefits, or SNAP.    The Governor's budget

 4   moves us closer to a future in which quality

 5   higher education is accessible to all low-

 6   and middle-income New Yorkers at no cost, and

 7   we thank him for his leadership.

 8           For our community colleges, we are

 9   very thankful that the Legislature has

10   supported base aid increases in recent budget

11   cycles.   The university seeks your help in

12   this again.

13           Now I would like to take a few minutes

14   to address tuition.    The capacity to adapt

15   and plan ahead is critical to effective

16   leadership, and we welcome the flexibility

17   that the Governor's proposal to extend the

18   Predictable Tuition Policy through 2025 gives

19   us.   The current proposed tuition increase of

20   $100 per semester would generate $36 million

21   for the senior colleges for the next fiscal

22   year.

23           Students who are in the most need will

24   have any additional out-of-pocket tuition
                                                    162

 1   costs significantly defrayed or covered

 2   completely by New York State's generous

 3   financial aid programs -- TAP, Excelsior,

 4   SEEK, College Discovery, and the Peralta

 5   DREAM Act -- along with federal Pell grants.

 6         We are proud of our affordability and

 7   the value that we are able to offer our

 8   students.   Two out of three CUNY

 9   undergraduates do not pay for tuition out of

10   pocket, and three of four of our graduates

11   leave debt-free.   As such, even with the

12   proposed adjustments, CUNY's tuition will

13   remain of high value, even as it will

14   continue to be much lower than any other

15   university systems throughout the country.

16         As I mentioned, CUNY has earned high

17   regard as a national model in promoting

18   social and economic mobility.   For it to

19   remain so in a rapidly changing world, the

20   university must maintain our ability to

21   innovate and serve our core mission.    With

22   the continued support of the Governor and

23   you, I am confident that we can do so.

24         Regarding the university's capital
                                                     163

 1   program, we appreciate the Governor's

 2   Executive Budget commitment to CUNY's

 3   infrastructure needs, including its

 4   $284 million investment in critical

 5   maintenance for senior colleges and the

 6   $64 million in matching funds for community

 7   colleges.   These will continue to make a

 8   significant difference in upgrades and

 9   replacements for aging, mission-critical

10   elements of these buildings.

11         We are excited by the opportunities

12   offered by Governor Cuomo's proposal for a

13   two-to-one capital matching program, which

14   offers a unique opportunity for our senior

15   colleges to leverage private funds to

16   generate state support for new building

17   initiatives.

18         We have always been at the forefront

19   of integrating sustainability and energy

20   efficiency into our campus operations, our

21   curriculum and our research.   That is why

22   CUNY is currently investing over $340 million

23   in dozens of energy performance capital

24   projects on its campuses that will
                                                     164

 1   significantly reduce emissions.   But we have

 2   a challenge with our aged building stock,

 3   which includes 300 buildings, totaling

 4   29 million square feet.   They range in age

 5   from one year old to over 100 years old, with

 6   the average building age exceeding 50 years.

 7   That is why, over the past 10 years, CUNY has

 8   focused on retro-commissioning a process to

 9   improve the efficiency of an existing

10   building's equipment and systems.

11         Looking to the future, CUNY continues

12   its focus on leveraging its capital funds in

13   the upcoming five-year capital plan for

14   projects that will reduce CUNY's carbon

15   footprint and energy consumption.   CUNY's

16   capital program and initiatives reflect the

17   university's commitment to sustainable

18   technology and energy efficiency, including

19   CUNY's commitment to develop a plan to meet

20   the Climate Leadership and Community

21   Protection Act goals.

22         CUNY is an unparalleled resource for

23   the state and the city.   The increasing

24   investments that our funding partners have
                                                       165

 1   made over the past few years have paid

 2   undeniable dividends.    CUNY is finding new

 3   ways to help more students succeed

 4   academically, earn their degrees on time, and

 5   acquire the skills they need to build

 6   successful careers and fulfilling lives.

 7   There is also no question about the powerful

 8   impact that a dynamic CUNY has on all our

 9   citizens.     Now is the time we need to be an

10   even better and bolder university, and we ask

11   for your continued support in that

12   aspiration.

13          That concludes my testimony, and I'll

14   be very happy to answer your questions.

15          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    So thank you.

16   We're going to go to Deborah Glick, our

17   Higher Ed chair.

18          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    It's great to

19   see you, Chancellor.

20          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Good to see you

21   too.

22          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Thank you for

23   being here, and thank you for your testimony,

24   which covered a number of areas.
                                                       166

 1         In the capital, obviously you have a

 2   lot of owned space but also leased space, and

 3   I'm wondering, considering the money that has

 4   been allocated, what's your backlog, how long

 5   do you think it will take, how many years of

 6   providing this level of resources, for you to

 7   bring the campuses up to where you would like

 8   them to be?    So it's nice that we've done

 9   this, hopefully we could add more.    What is

10   the trajectory for capital needs at CUNY,

11   both the critical maintenance and really any

12   new builds?

13         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So thank you so

14   much for your question, and you know, thank

15   you also for your leadership in the Higher Ed

16   Committee.    And always, you know, proud to be

17   talking to a Queens College alum, and bring

18   you greetings on behalf of the 663 CUNY

19   students who live in your district and are

20   happy for your leadership.

21         We believe that the $284 million

22   provided in critical maintenance is about the

23   same amount that we received last year, and

24   it's a great step in moving to sort of build
                                                       167

 1   up our critical infrastructure needs.    I'll

 2   be happy to provide you -- because I think

 3   it's something that is in the five-year

 4   capital budget request that we put together,

 5   we have the actual number of what, you know,

 6   what that capped critical maintenance need

 7   is, so I can provide that to your office

 8   later.

 9            One of the things that we've been

10   exploring too is also the capacity to be able

11   to spend all those dollars in an efficient

12   way too, so that we can -- when we receive

13   funding from the state for capital, that we

14   can move quickly on the projects and get to

15   them.

16            So I'll be happy to provide you --

17   because we have quantified that number of

18   sort of what it will take to be in a state of

19   good repair, and I can provide that number to

20   your office.

21            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   And include in

22   that if there are additional specific areas

23   that have to do with accommodations for

24   students with disabilities.     CUNY has been a
                                                     168

 1   very open door, but sometimes the door isn't

 2   wide enough.

 3         So we'd like to know what additional

 4   specific dollars are needed for -- whether

 5   it's technological upgrades for kids with

 6   either hearing impairment or visual

 7   impairment.    So we understand that what you

 8   do for one cohort doesn't necessarily meet

 9   the need for others, so we would very much

10   like to --

11         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     We'd be

12   delighted to do that.

13         And in my previous life I -- for

14   example, at Queens College I can tell you how

15   important some projects that would seem

16   fairly basic to some others -- about sort of

17   making sure that our bathrooms are

18   ADA-compliant, small other things like making

19   sure that the ramps on the sidewalks are done

20   in the right way so that students with

21   disabilities that have to use their wheel

22   equipment can move forward.

23         We know how much that means to really

24   create an accessible campus, so we're doing
                                                        169

 1   work all across our campuses to do that.

 2   We'll be happy to quantify that.     And we also

 3   know how critical that is.

 4           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Obviously the

 5   ASAP program has been a model across the

 6   country, and we have to fight for it all the

 7   time.   There's always a cut.

 8           So perhaps you could provide the

 9   committee with how many students have moved

10   through ASAP over whatever particular period

11   of time, how many are currently enrolled, how

12   many have graduated, how many have moved on

13   to a four-year school.   We want to make the

14   case that this is a model that should be

15   replicated.   I know a lot of the other

16   schools, some of the private schools, see

17   that and say, That's the kind of thing we

18   need to do to get some of our at-risk

19   students over the finish line.     So that would

20   be very helpful.

21           You had some specific details on how

22   many -- what you're doing around the

23   sustainability.    And again, when you're

24   talking about you're investing 340 million --
                                                       170

 1   and I assume that a lot of that is

 2   energy-efficiency either in lighting,

 3   weatherization, that sort of thing -- it

 4   would be helpful for us to have a clearer

 5   understanding of where you've spent the money

 6   and how much more in that particular arena

 7   you need to go to meet your goal for having

 8   sustainable campuses.

 9         Because to some extent fixing up

10   science labs, which may be a very big part of

11   your capital plan, is not the same as making

12   certain that you don't have drafty windows

13   everywhere where you're losing out on both

14   air-conditioning or heating or whatever.     So

15   that would be helpful to understand where you

16   are in that goal.

17         And you also talked about the faculty.

18   We're always interested in knowing the

19   percentage of full-time faculty to adjuncts

20   and to graduate assistants.   So do you have

21   any of that information available now, where

22   you are in terms of your percentage of

23   full-time faculty to adjuncts?

24         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So yes, we --
                                                        171

 1   systemwide, the number of full-time faculty

 2   is a little under 40 percent, and the number

 3   of adjuncts is a little higher than 60:   I

 4   think like 39-61.

 5         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Do you have a

 6   large number of graduate teaching assistants?

 7         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Yes, we do.    I

 8   mean, I don't have the exact number of those;

 9   we can provide that to your office.

10         And again, the issue of the adjuncts

11   that you bring -- actually, on your first

12   question of ASAP, I do have at least some --

13   three out of four of your questions, I know

14   the answers.   So we have about 25,000

15   currently, students on ASAP.    They're about

16   38 percent of our entire community college

17   enrollment.    So a very robust part of our

18   community colleges are benefiting from ASAP.

19   We have graduated about 58,000 students from

20   ASAP over the duration of the program.

21         The data that you requested on their,

22   you know, graduation and where they're going,

23   that I don't have recorded to memory so we

24   can clearly provide that.
                                                      172

 1         We have been investing in leveraging

 2   resources.   For example, we have a

 3   million-dollar grant from the Bank of

 4   New York Mellon to provide transfer

 5   scholarships for ASAP students, sort of

 6   continuing the success of those students that

 7   have successfully moved through ASAP, and

 8   they're able to go to one of our four-year

 9   institutions.

10         As you know, ASAP has doubled the

11   graduation rate of students who are

12   comparable from a three-year graduation rate

13   of 53 percent for the ASAP students and

14   25 percent for comparable students over that.

15         So it's been an incredibly successful

16   program.   We are actually providing technical

17   assistance to several states, there are about

18   seven states that are replicating ASAP-like

19   programs, and CUNY is their technical

20   assistance partner.   Three community colleges

21   in Ohio just got a grant to do that.    And we

22   continue to learn from our ASAP program to

23   see what parts of that are things that we can

24   replicate with other student groups.
                                                        173

 1         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    A lot of

 2   colleges are facing pretty wholesale

 3   retirement age for an awful lot of faculty.

 4   Being in New York City, you may have a better

 5   record on diversity than perhaps SUNY, which

 6   is far-flung.   But where are you in terms of

 7   a diverse faculty?

 8         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      So there's --

 9   there's two ways to address that.    One is

10   that our numbers compare extremely favorably

11   to universities all over the nation.     I mean,

12   we have an extremely diverse faculty, and we

13   can provide the exact numbers and the

14   breakdown by groups -- I know I have that in

15   a table here someplace.

16         But we have a higher responsibility

17   precisely because we serve New York City, and

18   we're not where we need to be.    So we need to

19   have faculty, students -- I mean, we do have

20   faculty and staff that look like the students

21   that we have in the classroom.    We need

22   administrators that can do that too.     The

23   great thing is that we'd be making a

24   significant investment systemwide in that.
                                                      174

 1         And in the last five years, the

 2   numbers of new faculty that we hire, which is

 3   the key engine that's going to get that

 4   percentage higher, has increased by over

 5   50 percent.   So in the last five years, a

 6   vast majority of our hires have been coming

 7   from underrepresented groups, and so that's

 8   continued to move the dial.   And we're very

 9   proud of the work that our college presidents

10   have been doing in that front.

11         On that question, that is why I also

12   began my testimony making reference to the

13   importance of having a diverse team.   If I'm

14   going to be holding presidents accountable,

15   if I'm going to be talking to the system

16   about hiring more diverse faculty and staff,

17   the team that's around me has to represent

18   that diversity.   The presidents in the system

19   have to represent that diversity.   And I'm

20   very proud of the record that we have built

21   so far in getting individuals of great

22   credentials to join the administrative team,

23   and I think that sets the tone for the rest

24   of the system.
                                                      175

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 2           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you very

 3   much.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 5           We go to the Senate now.

 6           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7           Higher Ed Chair Toby Stavisky.

 8           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 9           Welcome back.

10           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Great to see

11   you.

12           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Good to see you,

13   and thank you for mentioning Queens College.

14           (Laughter.)

15           SENATOR STAVISKY:   First of all, you

16   indicated you would provide follow-up

17   information to the Assembly, and I ask that

18   you send a copy to the Senate also, because

19   some of those issues are issues that I was

20   going to bring up.

21           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Absolutely.

22           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Real quick,

23   remediation.   Because I'm -- I know the

24   numbers are getting better, but I don't think
                                                       176

 1   we're there yet.   What are the percentages or

 2   the costs of remediation, both at the

 3   four-year and two-year colleges?

 4         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So remediation

 5   is a very, very important topic and there's

 6   been a significant investment in CUNY to move

 7   away from remedial courses and more to

 8   co-curricular courses, which is where the

 9   field indicates is the better approach to get

10   students up to speed more quickly and

11   actually allow them to go into regular

12   courses in a timely fashion and spend less of

13   their financial aid with remedial courses.

14         We can provide you details on the

15   numbers in each of our community colleges,

16   and we're very proud of the progress that we

17   have made in moving from remedial courses to

18   co-curricular courses.    We are hoping that in

19   the near future we can be in a place where

20   all of our formerly remedial courses are done

21   in a co-curricular way.    So we're talking to

22   our community college presidents.   And I have

23   some experience, having served as the

24   president at Hostos Community College, about
                                                     177

 1   how important it is to do that in a timely

 2   fashion, so we can provide you those figures.

 3         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Thank you.

 4         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    I'm also very

 5   proud of our partnerships with the DOE.

 6         We just began a pilot program, it's

 7   CUNY On Track, with funding from the Carnegie

 8   Endowment, and that is a way to see if we can

 9   use some of the lessons that we have learned

10   with some of the programs like CUNY Start,

11   Math Start, that we have shown that they're

12   very good at remedial, can we start with our

13   schools in 10th grade, in 11th grade, letting

14   the students know whether they're on track or

15   not -- and then, if they're not, do some

16   interventions, in partnership with the DOE,

17   that would get them to be college-ready by

18   the time they graduate, meaning there would

19   be less remediation when they get to us.   So

20   we're very excited about those partnerships

21   with the DOE.

22         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Thank you.   Yes,

23   I've always felt that this should not be a

24   cost on CUNY but on DOE.
                                                        178

 1         You mentioned the Governor's 24 or

 2   $25 million allocation for the maintenance of

 3   effort to fund the contract, et cetera.      But

 4   there are additional costs mandated through

 5   the contract and not funded.    How do you

 6   propose to fund all of those other costs?

 7   Traditionally we've done it in an MOE bill or

 8   a pay bill, as we used to call it.

 9         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So thank you

10   for your question, and let me begin by saying

11   how important it was for me and how proud I

12   was to be able to work with our partners in

13   the Professional Staff Congress early on in

14   my tenure to get that contract done.

15         SENATOR STAVISKY:   Good.

16         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     I mean, we have

17   now, you know, five years of stability on the

18   labor front.   I believe that we have also all

19   of the other contracts with the rest of our

20   labor unions also ratified, so I'm very, very

21   proud of that track record.    I think it was

22   an important signal to our adjuncts to show

23   that we value them, and to be able to

24   compensate them in a fairer way.
                                                     179

 1         We included the cost for the contract

 2   in our budget request, and we look forward to

 3   working with you all throughout this

 4   legislative session to be able to sort of

 5   meet all those needs.

 6         SENATOR STAVISKY:     You discussed the

 7   ASAP program, which I think is -- it's got

 8   the funding, the additional 2.5 million, I

 9   think -- the funding has to be found, whether

10   it's with the city or with the state.

11         But there are other programs -- the

12   childcare, the College for Labor and Urban

13   Studies, CUNY LEADS, there were other costs.

14   How do you propose to take up the gap that's

15   caused by these program -- the budget cuts?

16         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Thank you for

17   that question and bringing those very

18   important issues to bear.

19         On the issue of childcare, as those of

20   you who are in the -- who are part of the

21   hearing and know me, very dear to my heart.

22   As a former commissioner of family service

23   for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, I was in

24   charge of certifying childcare and day
                                                       180

 1   centers in Puerto Rico and made it my habit

 2   then, as commissioner, and at Hostos in our

 3   childcare center, and at Queens, to go read

 4   and visit and spend time, because I know how

 5   important that is for our students to be able

 6   to know that their children are taken care of

 7   so they can study.

 8         I know that now I need to find a place

 9   where I can go read because, you know, the

10   child center offices have a daycare, I have

11   to visit some of the campuses to do that.    So

12   we look forward to working with all of you to

13   be able to restore those vital funds.

14         We're also looking into other

15   partnerships so that we can expand the work

16   that we do around the issue of childcare.    I

17   am part of an Aspen Institute group that

18   works on two-generational strategies to

19   combat poverty.   So we're looking into some

20   funding to be able to be creative to work in

21   our centers and also with our students who

22   are parents.

23         SENATOR STAVISKY:   We touched upon the

24   capital, the 200 million for CUNY, the
                                                       181

 1   capital two-for-one match.    Which means that

 2   you're going to have to raise the $1 million.

 3   And you and I discussed that briefly prior to

 4   this hearing, because I certainly don't want

 5   to see that go unmatched, so to speak.

 6         How do you propose to raise -- that's

 7   a lot of money for the -- raising that

 8   $1 million match for the construction.    And I

 9   must say I think it's extremely critical

10   because so many of the buildings at CUNY,

11   they were built 50, 60, 70 years ago, and

12   critical maintenance is not sufficient.    You

13   need some shovels in the ground, and you need

14   some new construction.   How are you going to

15   do this?

16         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So thank you

17   for your question.   And I know the interest

18   in capital funding for CUNY has been an

19   interest of you historically, so you've been

20   a partner with us in advocating for those

21   resources.

22         I believe that the Governor's proposed

23   two-for-one program presents a great

24   opportunity for us at CUNY.   First, we've
                                                      182

 1   been able -- now we'd be able to go to donors

 2   that would have an incentive to support some

 3   because they know their dollars are going to

 4   go a longer term, right?   We didn't have that

 5   incentive before when we go out there talking

 6   to potential donors about that.   Donors like

 7   to donate to capital.   They like to have

 8   buildings and rooms and spaces named after

 9   them.

10           So I think that the combination of

11   that, the philanthropic spirit that combines

12   many of our alumni that have been supportive

13   of the work that we do at CUNY -- and now we

14   have an added incentive to be able to do

15   that.   We look forward to working with all of

16   you and with the Executive in creating the

17   most flexible terms for that matching program

18   so that we have the utmost flexibility, and

19   concur with you that the capital needs are

20   really critical.

21           As I mentioned to you, our enrollment

22   has increased significantly in the last

23   decade.   Our campuses are anchor institutions

24   in all those communities, so it's not just
                                                       183

 1   that they're used for classroom space, but

 2   they're used for outside community groups

 3   that use our space that convene there.     Many

 4   of the elected officials also, you know, use

 5   our facilities for town halls and things like

 6   that.   So those buildings take an extra

 7   beating, so they need to be repaired.    So I

 8   would look forward to working with you on

 9   that.

10           But we think that the two-for-one

11   presents a great opportunity to tap into

12   resources that now would now be motivated to

13   give.

14           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

15           At the December hearing at

16   250 Broadway, the students spoke very

17   graphically about the crumbling

18   infrastructure.   They spoke about how they

19   learn -- classes were being held in trailers

20   and all sorts of situations.    And I sent you

21   the material, and I appreciate your response.

22   But I emphasize that these students should

23   not have to try to study under very trying --

24   it's hard enough if they are -- have food

 1   insecurity, housing insecurity, and then come

 2   to school and don't have a decent classroom.

 3            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    I couldn't

 4   agree more with you, Senator.      Thank you.

 5            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 6            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7            Assembly.

 8            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 9   Assemblyman Epstein.

10            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Chancellor,

11   thank you for being here.      I really

12   appreciate all your dedication.

13            So just -- are you happy with the

14   state funding the Governor has proposed for

15   CUNY?

16            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So thank you

17   for your question, and great to see you

18   again.

19            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    You too.

20            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    And I bring you

21   greetings on behalf of the 1,690 CUNY

22   students that are in your district.

23            (Laughter.)

24            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So thank you
                                                        185

 1   for your support and representing them well.

 2           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Thank you.

 3           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    The budget

 4   provides some exciting opportunities for us.

 5   The -- the funds for the Opportunity Programs

 6   is very, very dear to my heart, and I've seen

 7   at the campuses how important the SEEK

 8   program, for example, is to so many of our

 9   students and opening the door --

10           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Chancellor, I'm

11   sorry, I only get five minutes --

12           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Okay.

13           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    -- so I don't --

14   so you think it's fine, it's adequate, is

15   that what you're saying?

16           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    We're excited

17   and we look forward to working with all of

18   you here to continue to find additional

19   resources.

20           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Because, as you

21   know, Baruch is in my district -- and thank

22   you for the appointment, I look forward to

23   working with him in this stark moment that we

24   have.
                                                      186

 1         But I go to the buildings and, like we

 2   hear, crumbling infrastructure, students who

 3   are telling us they won't eat today, right?

 4   Students are saying, I can't afford to either

 5   pay the books fee or the mental health

 6   services fee.   And when they are now paying a

 7   new fee, they don't even have access to real

 8   mental health services.   So the waiting list

 9   is forever, and people who have serious

10   mental health needs are being unmet.

11         So I want to know, really, can we rely

12   on you to come push for real funding?

13   Because students really need additional funds

14   to be able to have a high-quality education.

15         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So again, thank

16   you for the question and for your commitment.

17   I look forward to introducing you to

18   President Wu at the appropriate time.    I

19   think that I'm very proud of that first

20   appointment and I'm sure he's going to do

21   great things for Baruch and take it to the

22   next level.

23         We have been working very, very hard

24   in making sure that many of those needs that
                                                         187

 1   you identified are met throughout the system.

 2   If you look at programs that help students

 3   with their transportation costs, right, in

 4   ASAP those 25,000 students all get free

 5   MetroCards.

 6            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    But -- but

 7   the -- I do appreciate that.      But the kids

 8   outside of ASAP and the kids who we hear

 9   from, from the part-timers, right.      You know,

10   I -- I -- I don't want to make it -- I

11   appreciate a rosy picture, but it's not what

12   we're hearing from students or from faculty.

13   We're hearing the opposite story.

14            So is there something that we're

15   missing here where the students and the

16   faculty are saying "We're struggling" and

17   you're providing a real rosy approach to it?

18            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    I -- I -- I --

19   I wouldn't necessarily characterize my

20   approach as rosy.    I'm just telling you all

21   the efforts that we're doing in the different

22   fronts, on transportation, on the cost of

23   books.    I mean, the Open -- the funding, as I

24   mentioned to you, $48 million saved on
                                                        188

 1   students' -- on books, that's about $100 per

 2   student in the past two years.   That

 3   investment from you all, it goes to allowing

 4   students to free up that money to do other

 5   things.

 6         On the food insecurity front, we are

 7   fighting that on a number of fronts.     We have

 8   an initiative, a pilot program that we're

 9   doing with the City Council that provides a

10   thousand students with vouchers of $400 per

11   semester to address food insecurity.

12         The work that we've been doing in

13   making food pantries available, we have

14   funding from the Petrie Foundation for the

15   food pantries.   We have funding from the

16   Petrie Foundation to explore more ways to

17   support the students.

18         One thing that in our budget request,

19   when it put the category of more resources

20   into wellness, we want folks on our campus --

21   we have data that 70 percent of our students

22   who are eligible for SNAP might not be

23   seeking that benefit.   We need additional

24   staff to be able to connect the students to
                                                      189

 1   all those things.   And that is why our budget

 2   request talks about exactly those kinds of

 3   issues.

 4         And I want to point out other things

 5   that we're doing, and we are conscious that

 6   we need to do more.

 7         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    So great, I do

 8   appreciate it.   And you know you have

 9   partners here to help you do more.

10         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Absolutely.

11         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Just -- I wonder

12   if there -- you know, with additional

13   resources and dedicated funding, I know we

14   hear that a lot, with the TAP gap, really

15   closing the TAP gap, helping expand ASAP --

16   do you think if we had dedicated funding

17   you'd be in a position to be able to expand

18   ASAP, provide additional resources to

19   students for books, food insecurity, housing

20   insecurity -- we hear story after story of

21   kids who are homeless who are just trying to

22   go to school, kids who just aren't eating and

23   trying to get to school.   These are real

24   stories that I know you know about, and we
                                                      190

 1   want to make those stories that the

 2   experience of that doesn't happen, so people

 3   can actually graduate and not have these

 4   insecurities and really become productive

 5   members in our society.

 6         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So we're

 7   totally on the same page.   And that's why in

 8   our budget request we have an entire category

 9   sort of dedicated to precisely providing that

10   kind of support.

11         On the issue of the TAP gap, which you

12   address, also in our budget request we know

13   that the -- that the gap is -- it would be an

14   $86 million estimate on the next year, 78 in

15   this current year.   And we know that that's a

16   big, that's a big number, so in our budget

17   request we suggested beginning with 9 and

18   sort of phasing it in to be able to get

19   additional resources.

20         So again, at the end of the day, we

21   concur that if we have more full-time

22   faculty, if we have more advising, more

23   counselors, more individuals to be able to

24   connect students to resources, you know,
                                                         191

 1   we'll have the university that we all aspire

 2   to.

 3            Thank you.

 4            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 5            Senate?

 6            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7            Senator John Liu.

 8            SENATOR LIU:   Thank you, Madam Chair.

 9            Welcome, Felix.

10            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Good to see

11   you, sir.

12            SENATOR LIU:   We've known each other

13   for a long time.

14            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    That's correct.

15            SENATOR LIU:   Congratulations, or my

16   condolences, take whichever one you like.

17            (Laughter.)

18            SENATOR LIU:   Even though we've known

19   each other for a long time, nothing's

20   personal here because we've got issues.

21   Right?    And let me ask, who -- who appointed

22   you?

23            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    The Board of

24   Trustees.
                                                         192

 1           SENATOR LIU:   The Board of Trustees,

 2   okay.   Interesting.

 3           Who nominated you?

 4           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Nominated me

 5   for the job?

 6           SENATOR LIU:   Yes.

 7           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    I don't know.

 8   That is -- you have to ask the search firm.

 9           SENATOR LIU:   Okay.    All right, good

10   answer.

11           (Laughter.)

12           SENATOR LIU:   I think we -- I think we

13   know the Governor had something to do with it

14   too, right?    A little bit.    Yes, the Governor

15   had something to do with it?

16           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    I -- I -- I

17   have the full support of the Governor and of

18   the Mayor, yes.

19           SENATOR LIU:   Okay.    And the Governor

20   is proposing this budget that Assemblymember

21   Epstein asked you about.

22           So look, I'm just saying that we know

23   you have to be a gentleman here, but I know

24   deep in your heart you are deeply upset and
                                                        193

 1   disappointed at the paltry amount that the

 2   Governor is proposing for CUNY funding.     You

 3   don't have to answer that.

 4            But Harvey, I really believe that, all

 5   right?    Because the funding is not enough.

 6   It's just not enough.    And we keep asking our

 7   students to pay more and more and more.     I

 8   mean, for goodness sake, they're resorting to

 9   having to hold bake sales, bake sales, so

10   that they can take care of their tuition.

11            The problem is this.    The problem is

12   that for too many years, operating costs for

13   CUNY has -- the percentage of operating costs

14   for CUNY paid out of tuitions and fees keeps

15   going up.    So does your administration think

16   that at some point this could be reversed, or

17   is it just going to keep going up and up and

18   up?

19            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So let me talk

20   to you from the bottom of my heart.     Right?

21   And first, I'm deeply proud of serving as the

22   chancellor of the City University of

23   New York.    I think there's no institution of

24   higher ed in the country that has a better
                                                         194

 1   track record of social mobility, of moving

 2   individuals that come from the lowest

 3   socioeconomic index to the middle class and

 4   above.     That's been documented.   That is the

 5   core of our mission, which is done through a

 6   formula of a high-quality education and

 7   access.

 8            The State of New York has been a

 9   champion nationally in investing in higher

10   education, and that is the work of the

11   Governor and that's the work also of the

12   Assembly and the Senate in providing funding

13   for all of us.    So I am happy and proud for

14   that support and will continue to advance

15   that cause moving forward.

16            I am also proud of a university where

17   two out of three students do not pay any

18   tuition.     Right?   That is the national model

19   for our country.      Three out of four of our

20   students graduate debt-free.      Right?     Very

21   few --

22            SENATOR LIU:    I know, but we keep

23   hearing that --

24            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Very few
                                                       195

 1   college presidents can actually make those

 2   numbers.

 3         So from the bottom of my heart, I am

 4   very proud of those numbers.    I wake up every

 5   day to help to continue to transform this

 6   university, in partnership with you, with

 7   additional --

 8         SENATOR LIU:   Is the implication of

 9   that to say that the $200 or $100 per

10   semester tuition increases don't really

11   matter, that they don't hurt?   Because two

12   out of three don't pay tuition or three out

13   of four graduate debt-free, is that what

14   you're trying to imply?

15         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So what I'm

16   saying is that in the last four or five years

17   in which we also had the discretion to raise

18   tuition, right, the City University of

19   New York has used that discretion very, very

20   thoughtfully.

21         For four years there was no tuition

22   increase in the community colleges.   Right?

23   That we had the authority to do that, it

24   didn't mean that we used it all the time.
                                                         196

 1   Every year we did a detailed budget analysis

 2   and we looked at the reality of our fiscal

 3   responsibilities and our student body, and we

 4   have used that authority judiciously, in a

 5   way that provides investments to the

 6   campuses.

 7           I want to make sure that the record is

 8   clear, those are the facts, that we have --

 9   at different times we have decided not to

10   increase tuition.   So --

11           SENATOR LIU:   I'm just trying to get a

12   better handle about why tuition is being

13   relied upon more and more to pay a larger

14   share of the operating costs.     That's what

15   I'm trying to get at here.

16           Is there any way to at least -- you

17   know, is there any breakdown between the

18   classroom aspect of CUNY costs and kind of

19   administrative CUNY costs?      Is there any kind

20   of breakdown there?

21           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    In terms of the

22   cost?

23           SENATOR LIU:   I think your deputy is

24   nodding his head like "yes."
                                                          197

 1         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Yeah, we can

 2   provide you those figures, yes.

 3         SENATOR LIU:      What I mean, what's --

 4   what percentage, roughly?    Administrative

 5   costs 30 percent of the overall CUNY costs?

 6   Twenty percent?   To the nearest 10 percent.

 7   We don't have to be that precise here.

 8         CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:     Administrative

 9   costs are, I would say, less than 10 percent

10   of the overall costs.

11         SENATOR LIU:      And has that been

12   decreasing or increasing over the last, say,

13   10 years?

14         CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:     I would say it's

15   probably been stable --

16         SENATOR LIU:   About the same.

17         CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:     (Nodding.)

18         SENATOR LIU:      About the same.   So

19   CUNY costs overall continue to increase.       But

20   because tuition keeps paying -- is funding

21   more and -- a larger and larger share of the

22   overall costs, CUNY tuition is going up

23   faster than these operating costs.

24         CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:     Well, Senator Liu,
                                                        198

 1   the one thing I just want to point out is

 2   that the budget request that we put forth for

 3   fiscal year '21 that was approved by a Board

 4   of Trustees, one of the things that we really

 5   looked at and that we were pleased that we

 6   were able to accomplish in the budget request

 7   is the amount of money that comes from our

 8   operating budget from tuition would stay

 9   stable within our budget request.

10            SENATOR LIU:   Even though the last

11   nine years it's gone up --

12            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     No, John, I'm

13   sorry, you can't continue.       He can just

14   close.

15            SENATOR LIU:   All right, thank you.

16   Thank you.

17            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

18            Assembly.

19            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

20   Assemblyman Pichardo.

21            ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Thank you,

22   Chancellor.    Welcome.   Congratulations again.

23            So I don't want to -- we're short on

24   time, but I want to reiterate the concerns
                                                       199

 1   that both my colleagues Senator Liu and

 2   Assemblymember Epstein have mentioned.     So I

 3   add my voice to theirs.

 4         But with that being said, I kind of

 5   want to get a sense of -- you know, we passed

 6   the DREAM Act last year, which was a

 7   fantastic victory for this state.   So in your

 8   sense and estimation, do you have a sense of

 9   how many students -- how many CUNY students

10   have participated or taken advantage of the

11   Jose Peralta DREAM Act so far?

12         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    We don't -- we

13   don't have those numbers exactly.   And that

14   is, you know, sort of still a moving target.

15         We work very closely with Dr. Linares

16   and the entire team at HESC in making sure

17   that -- you know, particularly as a new

18   program that's being launched, there's always

19   initially some kinks.   So we're working very

20   closely with that team to make sure that if

21   we identify issues, we share them with them

22   quickly so they can make the adjustment.

23         One of the things that referred to our

24   campuses, we also continue to -- but we've
                                                         200

 1   been out there letting students know about

 2   the opportunity.   I was particularly

 3   concerned about students that might have been

 4   at CUNY before and might have left --

 5   right? -- because they didn't have funding.

 6   And I assume that because the program is new,

 7   it only included new students.    Right?    So we

 8   are very aggressive in targeting the

 9   communications to both students who will be

10   starting now, to some students that might

11   have, you know, sort of left and come back.

12         But we're very, very excited.     I know

13   that all of you worked very, very hard to get

14   that funding approved.   And obviously being

15   named after a CUNY and Queens college alum

16   and a dear friend means a lot to me

17   personally too.

18         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:      Thank you.

19   And, last question, I know it's been

20   mentioned about the Opportunity Programs,

21   especially ASAP.   I think we mentioned that

22   the Governor zeroed out the program.       It's

23   important that obviously we all raise our

24   voice to make sure that we re-implement those
                                                       201

 1   cuts, that this is a priority for not only

 2   the Legislature, but for the Executive.

 3         And I know that for CUNY itself, it's

 4   important that we continue to support these

 5   students, particularly students who need the

 6   most help.   Like in my district, I have the

 7   opportunity and the honor of representing

 8   Bronx Community College.   So we need to make

 9   sure that they stay in the forefront.

10         Also, speaking of Bronx Community

11   college, I've met with Dr. Isekenegbe many

12   times on, obviously, the concerns of the

13   capital needs for the campus.   And I know

14   CUNY has invested heavily within the Bronx

15   Community College, but there's still a lot of

16   pretty big capital needs, particularly on the

17   issue of the central heating and cooling

18   system.   So I know we are trying to move

19   forward and figure out investments and

20   pathways to fund that.

21         But right now, where do you think is

22   the biggest need in terms of Bronx Community

23   College in terms of its capital needs?

24         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So again, thank
                                                       202

 1   you for your support.   And again, on behalf

 2   of your 4,181 CUNY students in your

 3   district --

 4           (Laughter.)

 5           ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:   You're really

 6   good at this.

 7           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   -- I bring you

 8   greetings.    And I know you know them, because

 9   I know that you are a presence in our campus

10   and you've been a higher ed supporter and

11   champion.

12           And ASAP is particularly important for

13   Bronx Community College because as you know,

14   we are trying to use Bronx Community as a

15   flagship of what a college would look like if

16   almost, you know, most of the students could

17   be supported by ASAP.   And that experiment

18   continues very, very well, that program of

19   President Isekenegbe and his team.    So it's

20   very, very important for the future of ASAP

21   that what we're doing at BCC continues to go

22   well.

23           BCC is one of the most beautiful

24   campuses, and the investments in
                                                       203

 1   infrastructure sometimes are the things that

 2   nobody sees, like the steam pipelines and the

 3   things that are not attractive, because you

 4   don't get to cut a ribbon when you do HVAC

 5   and those things.   But they're indispensable

 6   to be able to support our students.    So we're

 7   happy that the current budget provides

 8   critical maintenance funding to be able to

 9   continue those programs by the matching funds

10   for the community colleges.   It's important

11   to put that up-front so that we can get the

12   rest of the funding from the city.

13         You and I were there in the

14   ribbon-cutting for the renovated swimming

15   pool also at BCC, so we continue to invest in

16   Bronx Community and our other campuses too.

17         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    All right, my

18   time is up.   Thank you.

19         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Thank you.

20         ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

22         Before we go to the Senate, I just

23   wanted to acknowledge that Assemblyman

24   Colton, member of the Ways and Means
                                                           204

 1   Committee, has been here for some time.       And

 2   we also were joined by Assemblywoman McMahon.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Great.   And we've

 4   been joined by Senator Jim Gaughran.

 5            But our next questioner is Senator

 6   Robert Jackson.

 7            SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you, Madam

 8   Chair.

 9            Chancellor, good afternoon.

10            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Good afternoon.

11   Great to see you.

12            SENATOR JACKSON:   Good seeing you.

13   And I'm happy that you're the chancellor of

14   the City University of New York.      And I say

15   to you, I'm looking at some of your staff

16   there -- and I know some of them -- and I'm

17   looking at the diversity of the people that

18   are sitting there.    And that's a very

19   positive sign, in my opinion.

20            But I wanted to touch base with you

21   about the budget.    Do you think that the

22   Executive Budget put forward by the Governor

23   is enough in order to move forward CUNY in

24   the direction that you want it to go?
                                                      205

 1          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   I mean, clearly

 2   we're excited about the funding to be able to

 3   advance the agenda we've laid out as

 4   chancellor.   As I mentioned in my testimony,

 5   there are some areas like career engagement

 6   which are very, very clear and important to

 7   me.   I know that Chancellor Johnson in her

 8   testimony about SUNY spoke about the

 9   importance of internships, and it's

10   something -- a passion that we both have.

11   Internships, for example, we have examples

12   that students who participate in paid

13   internships, right, when they go get jobs,

14   they get that job faster and their first-time

15   pay is higher.   Right?

16          When 50 percent of the students you

17   serve are students who are the first one in

18   their family to go to college, that

19   opportunity is something that we need to

20   advance.

21          Also, if you think about our price

22   point at the City University of New York, if

23   we have students going out there, getting

24   paid between $3,000 and $5,000 for a paid
                                                       206

 1   internship, right, if you're a community

 2   college student, that's a year of tuition.

 3   Right?    If your tuition is paid for, that's

 4   your money for transportation, for food

 5   insecurity.

 6            So I'm excited about the chances that

 7   this budget allows to make investment in

 8   those areas, yes.

 9            SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you.    Thank

10   you.   Chancellor, I'm just going to try to

11   ask some quick questions --

12            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   Sorry.

13            SENATOR JACKSON:   -- because my time

14   is limited.    I would love to have a dialogue

15   with you, maybe I'll come to your office.

16            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   The door is

17   always open.    Or I'll go to yours.

18            SENATOR JACKSON:   But with respect

19   to I asked a question -- I'm asking you the

20   question, the Professional Staff Congress

21   just negotiated a contract, and you have a

22   lot of adjuncts that were working and they

23   were paid peanuts, in my opinion, and so they

24   got an increase.
                                                      207

 1           In the Executive Budget, was their

 2   contract paid for in the Executive Budget, or

 3   it must come out of the hides of all of the

 4   colleges?

 5           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   So again, I am

 6   extremely proud of that contract, to be able

 7   to provide a 71 percent increase in the

 8   salary of the adjuncts.    It's national news.

 9           SENATOR JACKSON:   It's about damn

10   time.   You know that, right?

11           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   I agree with

12   you.    And also to create some mechanisms to

13   allow them to be more integrated.   I mean

14   now, for example, they're going to be getting

15   paid for their hours -- their office hours

16   and things that we did not include before.

17           SENATOR JACKSON:   But I just asked

18   you, is it covered -- was that money for the

19   contract put into the Executive Budget, or

20   it's not?    Because if not, then it has to

21   come from somewhere.   And so if I'm the

22   president of City College, which is in my

23   district -- along with Bryan Benjamin -- then

24   I'm going to either have to cut staff or cut
                                                        208

 1   programs.

 2           So my question is, it wasn't covered,

 3   an increase in the budget?      So how do you

 4   expect them to then deal with that if in fact

 5   it was not put in the budget?

 6           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So we put -- in

 7   our budget request, we requested funding to

 8   be able to pay for our mandatory cost

 9   increases.   We also included a request for

10   the funding to be able to provide for the

11   increase in our regular salary costs too.

12   And I'm very confident that throughout this

13   process, at the end of the journey, with your

14   support, we'll be able to get a budget that

15   I'll also be able to fund all those needs.

16           SENATOR JACKSON:   Well -- and I read

17   your statement as far as -- and I have CUNY

18   PSC's testimony.   They say, from a capital

19   point of view, the needs are like $5 billion.

20   And the labs are so outdated, it's not really

21   functioning at the level that they're

22   supposed to.   Do you agree or disagree with

23   that?

24           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So we're happy
                                                       209

 1   to have about $284 million in critical

 2   capital needs -- to address needs like the

 3   ones that you identified.     I'm sure that our

 4   good colleague Barbara Bowen will also

 5   identify when she provides her testimony.

 6         And we're trying to address all those

 7   needs and make sure that the students have

 8   the facilities that they need.     We're also

 9   working very hard with our campuses to

10   expedite the usage of the funds when we get

11   them, to be able to get to those construction

12   projects and renovations quickly.

13         So we're aware of those needs and I

14   look forward to, with your support,

15   addressing them in the future.

16         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

17         SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you.

18         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Assembly.

19         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Assemblywoman

20   Hyndman.

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:      Thank you,

22   Madam Chair, and to Chancellor Matos

23   Rodriguez, congratulations.

24         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      Great to see
                                                       210

 1   you.

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   I've -- we've

 3   come to know each other very well over your

 4   trajectory from Puerto Rico to the Bronx to

 5   Queens and now as the chancellor.

 6            So one of the things you mentioned is

 7   that you have to fill vacancies for nine CUNY

 8   presidents?

 9            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Now eight.

10            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   Now eight.

11            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Yes.

12            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   How close are

13   you for -- I don't have a college in my

14   district, but how close are you to the one

15   that is close to my district, in making a

16   decision there?    That was one of my

17   questions.

18            The other question is, of the ASAP

19   program that you talked about, you know, it's

20   great.    I don't think CUNY should have ever

21   needed a program to make sure students are

22   graduating on time, but apparently we did.

23            What about the students that are not

24   part of ASAP -- food equity, transportation?
                                                          211

 1   A lot of these students are part-time;

 2   Excelsior doesn't apply to them.     What is

 3   your take on those students and the

 4   remediation courses that I know you're trying

 5   to get away from, but we know are necessary.

 6   That's my second question.

 7           And when it comes to OER, how -- I'm

 8   glad that the increase -- you've been able to

 9   save money on the increase from 2017 to 2019

10   of those individuals.    So you said $1 for

11   every $7 is what you're saving?

12           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    The students --

13   the students saved $7 for every dollar that

14   the State of New York put into the program.

15           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   Oh, okay.     How

16   do you audit the materials that are in OER as

17   a system?    And how many CUNY students in my

18   district?

19           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So for some

20   reason, I need to get the number of students

21   in your district, and we'll have that in a

22   second.     So let me take all your questions in

23   turn.

24           First, we cannot do eight searches at
                                                       212

 1   the same time, it would be impossible given

 2   the staffing that we have and also the number

 3   of trustees and others that determine those

 4   committees.

 5         So we are currently about to conclude

 6   the searches for the Graduate Center and

 7   Queens College.   We've seen the final list

 8   for those searches.    This week we just began

 9   the searches -- I was just at Borough of

10   Manhattan Community College, LaGuardia

11   Community College, and Queensborough

12   Community College, so we began those three

13   searches for community colleges this week.

14         In April we will begin the searches

15   for Lehman College, your college, and Guttman

16   Community College.    So -- and I am hoping

17   that after that, no more of my presidents

18   decide to retire and we catch a little break

19   on the search business.

20         (Laughter.)

21         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     You were asking

22   about ASAP.   One of the great things about

23   being a university that really cares about

24   its students is that we're always thinking to
                                                       213

 1   see what lessons from ASAP we learned that we

 2   can apply in some of the other colleges.

 3   Right?

 4            So for example, a lesson from ASAP was

 5   the importance of the MetroCards.    So at

 6   Guttman Community College, the 1,000 students

 7   that attend Guttman, through support from the

 8   City Council, get a free MetroCard.    It's

 9   something that we learned, we replicated at

10   Guttman.

11            Twelve thousand CUNY students have

12   been able to benefit from the first phase of

13   the Fair Fares program that New York City

14   started.    Right?   Now the program will sort

15   of roll out big, so we assume that we're

16   going to have a substantial number of our

17   students that are going to have a reduced

18   transportation cost as a result of that

19   program.

20            Overall, right now at CUNY between

21   Fair Fares, ASAP and Guttman, about 38,000

22   students have their MetroCards paid for free.

23   So we're trying in every place that we can to

24   learn what we learned from ASAP and see how
                                                       214

 1   it applies to other students and other

 2   populations to be able to continue to advance

 3   our Student Success Agenda.

 4         You asked about OER, right?     Those

 5   programs are implemented with the help of the

 6   campus library and the faculty.   The faculty

 7   who participate, participate voluntarily.

 8   And I am proud to say that when faculty have

 9   seen the kinds of resources available and the

10   impact it has on the students, the number of

11   faculty who are interested in participating

12   keeps increasing.

13         But it is something that is done with

14   full faculty input.   Nobody is told, you

15   know, which books they need to use.   But I

16   think that given the faculty that we have

17   that come to CUNY in part because they want

18   to teach the students that we have and

19   they're committed to public higher education,

20   they've been embracing this initiative.     And

21   the kinds of success and savings that you're

22   seeing there couldn't have been done without

23   the support of our faculty, and we hope that

24   we can continue to expand that.

 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

 2         Senate?

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

 4         Senator Gounardes.

 5         SENATOR GOUNARDES:       Good morning.

 6         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      Good morning,

 7   Senator.

 8         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Good afternoon.

 9         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    Good afternoon,

10   jeez. We'll be here all day.    Good afternoon.

11         My parents met at Brooklyn College, I

12   graduated Hunter College, and I had the

13   privilege of teaching at Hunter College this

14   past semester, so CUNY runs through my blood.

15         I want to ask what is the dollar

16   amount for CUNY's budget today that is

17   covered by student tuition or private

18   sources?   And what percentage is that of the

19   total operating budget?

20         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      So the

21   percentage of -- your question is student --

22         SENATOR GOUNARDES:    Student tuition

23   and private support versus public support,

24   essentially.   So the dollar amount and the
                                                         216

 1   percentage.

 2         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:       So the

 3   undergrad percentage is 13 percent.        The

 4   graduate percentage is 4 percent.

 5         SENATOR GOUNARDES:       Four percent.

 6         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:       Yes.

 7         SENATOR GOUNARDES:       And what's the

 8   dollar amount for that?

 9         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:       Do you want

10   that now?

11         SENATOR GOUNARDES:       Well, I guess --

12         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:       We can get that

13   to you.     We have it here.

14         SENATOR GOUNARDES:       Yeah, I mean I'd

15   like to see that number now.      Because I think

16   it's relevant when we're talking about what

17   it's going to take to fully fund the City

18   University and what type of investment we

19   should be making.

20         If we're talking about 13 or

21   4 percent, that's not a lot that we can't

22   make up through a robust public investment.

23   So I want to know what that dollar amount is

24   and what we should be thinking about in terms
                                                         217

 1   of fully funding the operation of the

 2   university.

 3           CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:    The total amount

 4   that supports our operating budget -- which

 5   is 3.7 billion -- that comes from payments

 6   from students is $736 million.

 7           SENATOR GOUNARDES:   Seven hundred

 8   thirty-six million.     So if we found

 9   736 million, we could wipe out student

10   tuition, essentially.    Is that a fair

11   assessment, a fair way of thinking about

12   that?

13           CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:    Seven hundred

14   thirty-six million is the amount of money

15   that students pay out of pocket.

16           SENATOR GOUNARDES:   Okay.   That's

17   helpful, thank you.

18           I want to come back to the notion of

19   the, you know, three-fourths of students

20   graduate debt-free.     And that sounds really

21   great, but I guess at what cost is that?      You

22   know, if a student has to work two or three

23   jobs or has to elongate their education by a

24   year, two years or three years, does that --
                                                     218

 1   how do we -- students shouldn't have to put

 2   themselves through wringer just to graduate

 3   on time and debt-free.

 4         And the experience we've heard from

 5   students is that a lot of them are working

 6   two jobs.    Students that I taught this

 7   semester working two jobs just to pay their

 8   rent and pay their tuition.

 9         So when we say three-fourths graduate

10   debt-free, it feels like it's a little

11   disingenuous.   And we need to be doing a lot

12   more to make sure that we're fully supporting

13   all of the needs of students and giving them

14   an environment, both in the classroom and

15   outside the classroom, where they can

16   actually survive and thrive.

17         And I don't think we're doing that

18   right now.   That's based on my own

19   observations, the testimony we heard at the

20   hearings in the fall that Senator Stavisky

21   led, and my ongoing conversations with

22   students.

23         And so I too am very disappointed with

24   the investments we're making in this budget,
                                                    219

 1   or propose to make in this budget, that

 2   really goes to help students.   And I'm very

 3   concerned about that.

 4           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   So thank you

 5   for your concern.

 6           And I've always said, since my

 7   experience at Queens College and previously

 8   at Hunter, where I was on the faculty, that

 9   if we had instituted a $5 alumni gift from

10   all couples that met at CUNY, maybe, you

11   know, some of this fiscal situation would

12   have been addressed, because we have so many

13   couples that met either at the campuses or

14   between campuses.   So great to have your

15   story about your parents, and also your

16   commitment to CUNY.

17           You talked about the needs of our

18   students, and that's one of the things that

19   we take very seriously.   And it's very dear

20   to the heart -- my heart, our presidents

21   team.   That is why on areas like food

22   insecurity we've gone out there and secured

23   funding for this pilot program with the City

24   Council to be able to award food vouchers to
                                                      220

 1   our students.   We're beginning with a

 2   thousand students, and we're going to see how

 3   that has an impact on retention and

 4   graduation, and hopefully be able to expand

 5   it.

 6         The investment in lowering the cost of

 7   books -- if you have to spend less on books,

 8   that's more money that you have to be able to

 9   spend on other things.    And that's I think a

10   significant investment.

11         The investment in cutting down the

12   transportation costs, going back to the

13   numbers that I provided Assemblywoman Hyndman

14   in her question.   So I think that --

15         SENATOR GOUNARDES:     Just to respond

16   there, you know, if we weren't raising

17   tuition and if we weren't charging students

18   fees for mental health services, if we

19   weren't doing all these things, they could

20   afford transportation, they can afford room

21   and board, they could afford their rent, they

22   can afford to buy themselves a meal.

23         I think we need to shift the paradigm

24   of how we're thinking about funding higher
                                                       221

 1   education.   All these programs are great and

 2   we're spending a lot of money on them, but we

 3   can do more to make the costs lower for

 4   students on the education front and then find

 5   other ways to help them outside of that.      I

 6   think we need to think very carefully and

 7   smartly about how we need to do this in the

 8   future, because it's not working, I guess is

 9   my overall point.

10         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Thank you.

11         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you,

12   Senate.

13         Assembly?

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go now for a

15   second round to Assemblywoman Glick.

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you.

17         You must have sort of an overall view

18   of the capital needs -- not year to year, but

19   at some point I'd like to understand what

20   your long-range projection is so we can have

21   a -- you know, we've -- both houses have

22   supported five-year capital plans.     They

23   aren't always embraced, the bill gets vetoed.

24   So we'd like to know what the target is
                                                          222

 1   overall.

 2         Have you or the presidents been

 3   directed to increase your outreach for

 4   philanthropy?    Do you have a target that you

 5   would like to hit in order to -- obviously

 6   now you have a recommended, suggested in the

 7   budget, a match.    So already you're being

 8   told you have to go out and raise money in

 9   order to get some of the capital.    That's

10   public.     We want to understand if there's

11   been this suggestion for some time or if

12   there's some target that the trustees would

13   like you to hit that even might exceed what

14   is in the Governor's budget.

15         And you have the ASAP program.       It's

16   wonderful.    What is the equivalent in the

17   four-year schools?    Because clearly you have

18   students who come in, they're doing well --

19   they may have some sort of family crisis,

20   illness, what have you, and they start to

21   struggle.    Do you have a mechanism for

22   identifying them?    And then do you have a

23   plan or a program in place that replicates

24   ASAP, but for the four-year schools?       I think
                                                         223

 1   there is something, it's just the name is

 2   escaping me.

 3          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Yes.    ACE.

 4          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    ACE, okay.      If

 5   we could know a little bit more about how

 6   many students are getting supported in ACE,

 7   what's the -- how successful is it in the

 8   four years as compared to the ASAP program?

 9   So how big is it, how many have graduated,

10   and how many students are being assisted?

11          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Okay.

12          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Here in the

13   Capital Region there's something called

14   Universal Access.   It's a combination of

15   money that's been funded by some of the

16   corporations, and SUNY Albany throws money

17   in.   And it -- on your ID card it's in -- you

18   know, it's encoded and you can take a bus

19   or -- it's covered.

20          The city has put out a new sort of

21   low-income half-fare program.    How many

22   students are eligible for that?   Do they know

23   about it?   If this is something that you're

24   looking for additional money for One Stop, I
                                                       224

 1   assume, is --

 2         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Single Stop.

 3         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Single Stop.

 4   And so is this one of those things that

 5   students are assisted in?    I assume you have

 6   to apply for it.    Everything has to be

 7   applied for.    So you have to know about it in

 8   order to benefit.    That's okay.   So is this

 9   one of those things that students might be

10   able to access?

11         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So let me take

12   your questions in order.    You're making

13   reference to the Fair Fares program.     CUNY

14   was one of the target populations in the

15   initial rollout.    In that initial rollout,

16   already 12,000 students already signed up for

17   a discount MetroCard.    Now the city is going

18   out citywide, and it's based on income

19   eligibility.    That's a city program.

20         So we assume that thousands of CUNY

21   students will be able to benefit from that

22   program, and we've been out there

23   publicizing, you know, working with the city

24   in letting our students know that they need
                                                      225

 1   to take advantage of this program because it

 2   will be a significant benefit for them.

 3         In the community colleges where we

 4   have your Single Stop, which you made a

 5   reference to, that is one place that we've

 6   been partnering, getting the message out to

 7   get the students to know about all these

 8   programs.

 9         The connection of students to

10   programs -- you made a reference that

11   students need to know, that they need to

12   apply, they need to know the rules -- is one

13   of the reasons why in our budget request we

14   asked for additional resources to be able to

15   support staff that can connect students to

16   all those opportunities and can serve as

17   liaisons with the city agencies that provide

18   the rulings.

19         I'll send you the information on ACE.

20   ACE is a pilot program, we've done it for

21   three years now at John Jay.   We just began a

22   cohort at Lehman.   We can provide you with

23   the numbers.   The initial numbers are very,

24   very promising.   Modeled after ASAP.   We --
                                                        226

 1   in the same way that we built ASAP, we want

 2   to do that, test it, research, make sure that

 3   we're getting it right.

 4         To your question of philanthropy, all

 5   the presidents are expected to fundraise.

 6   And actually the ACE version at Lehman got a

 7   philanthropic gift to be able to expand the

 8   number of students.    Based on the prestige of

 9   ASAP, they said they want to invest in

10   Lehman, so the president got a gift.    Provost

11   Cruz used to be the president at Lehman

12   before I asked him to join us.

13         So we can send you more information.

14   It's extremely promising.   I've been charging

15   the committees that are looking for

16   presidents that an ability to fundraise is

17   one of the criteria they need to have.      It's

18   an important thing.    And the Governor's

19   two-to-one matching program allows us to go

20   to potential funders and have them further

21   incentivized to give because their dollar is

22   going an extra mile.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.
                                                       227

 1         We go to the Senate now.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

 3         Senator Ken LaValle.

 4         SENATOR LaVALLE:     Thank you.

 5         Senator Stavisky told us about her

 6   concerns for students being in crumbling

 7   facilities.   Senators Liu, Jackson and

 8   Gounardes told us of their concern for

 9   student costs going up, lack of funding.

10   Now, Chancellor, we all have personalities

11   and we show and express ourselves in

12   different ways.   I didn't get a sense -- I

13   mean, students being in crumbling facilities?

14   I would get a sense that you would be

15   outraged by that.

16         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Well, Senator,

17   first I want to thank you for your years of

18   service in the Senate and in higher ed.     And

19   all of us who are part of public higher ed

20   owe you a big debt of gratitude for your

21   commitment and your service.

22         To your question, I served 10 years as

23   a college president and 10 before as a

24   faculty member.   Right?   So I've been in the
                                                      228

 1   buildings at Hunter, at Hostos and at Queens.

 2   I think my colleagues both at Queens and at

 3   Hostos will tell you that as president I was

 4   always very attentive to all our

 5   infrastructure needs to make sure that if

 6   there were issues about, you know, bathrooms

 7   that were not ready, you know, buildings that

 8   needed repairs, that they were looked after

 9   quickly and in a way that showed respect for

10   the students.

11         We're doing the same thing at the City

12   University of New York.   We're trying to

13   stretch every dollar that we get.    We're

14   trying to get additional dollars to be able

15   to provide the facilities that our students

16   deserve.

17         So I am clearly, clearly disturbed

18   when I hear comments about things in our

19   facilities that do not match the -- the

20   respect that our students deserve.    My mom

21   and my dad in Puerto Rico are products of a

22   public university.   My dad became an

23   engineer.   I wouldn't be standing in front of

24   you if it was not that that door of
                                                          229

 1   opportunity was open for them, so I know what

 2   that means.   And when I see our students, I

 3   see them.   So I want for them the same kind

 4   of infrastructure that students at private

 5   campuses have.

 6         SENATOR LaVALLE:    You have requested a

 7   $120 a year health and student fee.    What is

 8   a student going to get for that?

 9         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      So thank you

10   for your question.

11         First let me say that that will be the

12   first fee that the City University of

13   New York has added since 2002.    Right?    So

14   when we think about tuition increases, when

15   we think about increasing fees, these are

16   things that we are thoughtful of when we do

17   them because we want to be sensitive to our

18   student population.

19         We have heard about needs of

20   additional mental health counselors.       We have

21   heard about needs about expansion of hours in

22   our wellness clinics.   We have heard about

23   additional support for students that have

24   food and housing insecurity.
                                                      230

 1           The proposed fee will work in this

 2   way.    We'll take one-third of the funding

 3   from the fee, the central office, and we will

 4   tell the campuses to invest it directly and

 5   immediately in adding mental health

 6   counselors and in adding personnel so that

 7   they can help the students -- for example, if

 8   you're food insecure, to be able to apply for

 9   SNAP.   If you have issues with housing, to be

10   able to identify -- we need people on the

11   ground to be able to connect the students to

12   do that.

13           So the first third of that fee will

14   begin to transform by providing, directly,

15   mental health counselors and other staff to

16   the campuses.

17           The other two-thirds will work in the

18   same way that the tech fee works now, which

19   means that it will go to a committee on the

20   campus, a committee with student voices,

21   faculty voices, and they will determine what

22   campus needs they have.   It won't be the

23   central office.   It will be, in each campus,

24   how do we supplement, what are some of the
                                                       231

 1   priorities that students have.      Right?

 2   Because the fee will be coming from the

 3   students.    So this will be a very direct way.

 4           We're also, you know, going to

 5   request -- we're asking the city and state

 6   for additional funding in the area of

 7   wellness, right?    So it's a comprehensive

 8   way.

 9           But the fee will directly go to

10   address some of these things we've been

11   hearing about in a very direct way, with

12   two-thirds of the funding going to the

13   campuses with student input into how the

14   funds get to be spent.

15           SENATOR LaVALLE:   I'm glad to hear

16   mental health was highlighted by you --

17   critical in today's world on our campuses.

18           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    We're in

19   agreement.   Thank you.

20           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

21           Assembly?

22           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Nope, we're

23   done.

24           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Oh, the
                                                         232

 1   Assembly's done.

 2            So Senator Jim Seward.

 3            SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you, Madam

 4   Chair.

 5            And Chancellor, welcome.

 6            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Thank you.

 7            SENATOR SEWARD:   I wanted to return to

 8   the discussion on tuition-free students at

 9   CUNY.    You mentioned that two out of three

10   students are tuition-free?

11            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    That's correct,

12   sir.

13            SENATOR SEWARD:   Does that mean that

14   with the tuition increases that we've seen as

15   well as projected for the next four years,

16   does that mean that those increases in

17   tuition are falling onto that third student?

18            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So about

19   70 percent of our students pay full tuition.

20   And so again, I want to remind you that the

21   proposed authority in our history at CUNY --

22   for example, we had it for the past four or

23   five years -- every year we determine whether

24   we want to be to able to -- we want to
                                                       233

 1   proceed with a tuition increase.     For four

 2   years in our community colleges we didn't do

 3   it.   Right?   So the fact that we're given the

 4   flexibility to move forward to do this --

 5   right?    I want to make sure that is clear,

 6   that every year we make an assessment as to

 7   whether we need that amount to be able to,

 8   you know, be part of our full funding

 9   structure or, like we've done in the past, we

10   decided that maybe in that year that's not

11   necessary.

12            So I want to make sure that we

13   remember that is the flexibility to do that,

14   and that we have a history at the City

15   University of at times deciding that we're

16   not going to do it.

17            SENATOR SEWARD:   If the proposed

18   tuition increases become part of the final

19   budget and you have that option, do you have

20   any concerns about how that will affect the

21   TAP gap moving forward for your various

22   campuses?

23            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   Absolutely.

24            And as I mentioned in reference to
                                                        234

 1   another question too, in our budget request

 2   we propose that -- just sort of a partial

 3   movement of restoring the TAP gap.    The

 4   amount that we put in the budget request was

 5   to begin with 9 million.

 6         You know, we know that 86, which is

 7   the total predicted for next year, is a large

 8   number.    We also know that you have many

 9   individuals coming to you with different

10   requests, right, so we want to be judicious

11   in that.   But we hope that over time we're

12   able to sort of fill that TAP gap, yes.

13         SENATOR SEWARD:    Okay.   Getting back

14   to the capital program and that issue, do you

15   maintain a backlog of projects that are

16   needed in regard to the facility condition

17   index, which measures the current conditions

18   of facilities requiring capital investment?

19   Can you give us some idea of what that

20   backlog is in your system?

21         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:      So I don't know

22   the number offhand, but we'll be happy to

23   provide that to your office.

24         SENATOR SEWARD:    Can you share with us
                                                         235

 1   what your budget request for capital projects

 2   and strategic initiatives were this year?

 3         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     I'm going to

 4   defer to our CFO, who knows those numbers a

 5   little better than I do.

 6         CUNY CFO SAPIENZA:    Senator, this is

 7   our capital project request book

 8   (indicating).    I hope all of you have it.    If

 9   you don't, we can certainly make sure we can

10   provide it to you.   It's 185 pages, very

11   comprehensive.   There's capital projects in

12   here for every single campus that are fully

13   detailed.

14         In our request for the next five-year

15   plan, we are seeking $5.2 billion:   3.8 for

16   the senior colleges, 1.4 for the junior

17   colleges.

18         SENATOR SEWARD:    Well, if it was up to

19   the Legislature, we would have a five-year

20   plan for both CUNY and SUNY.

21         I just wanted to shift gears quickly

22   to the community colleges in your system.

23   Are you experiencing enrollment declines?

24         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    We have.   And I
                                                     236

 1   think that it is something that -- you know,

 2   I served five years as a community college

 3   president at Hostos from 2009 to '14.

 4         First, it is not atypical at a time

 5   when the unemployment numbers are low and the

 6   economy is perceived to be better, the

 7   enrollment numbers in higher ed, but

 8   particularly in community colleges, are sort

 9   of countercyclical in that regard.

10         So we have seen -- we have been able,

11   in the past year or so, to sort of put some

12   of the brakes on that decline, but the

13   numbers have been going down for the past

14   two, three years.

15         SENATOR FELDER:    Even in declining

16   enrollment, the community colleges, both CUNY

17   and SUNY, do a tremendous job in terms of

18   workforce training and development.

19         And would you anticipate an

20   increase -- the need to increase community

21   college tuition based on the enrollment

22   levels of today?

23         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   So we are

24   asking for, first, additional support.    In
                                                     237

 1   this process in the past, the increase to the

 2   base aid I think is a continuing component,

 3   and we look forward to working with you to be

 4   able to restore that.

 5         We did, in this year, after four years

 6   of not having any increase in our community

 7   college, ask for an increase.   That increase

 8   would still be below the maximum TAP award.

 9   So we anticipate, you know, 90 percent of our

10   students in the community colleges not being

11   affected in terms of having to pay

12   out-of-pocket for that increase.

13         And again, as someone who served five

14   years in a community college, I also concur

15   with you about how important they are as a

16   door of opportunity, as a gateway, and also

17   as a key partner to the business community in

18   the workforce area.

19         SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you.

20         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Thank you.

21         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

22         I'm going to take my questions and

23   then we'll let Toby Stavisky close for the

24   Senate.
                                                        238

 1           So tuition goes up each year, but

 2   you're reporting that students aren't

 3   finishing school with debt.     So are we seeing

 4   an impact on their retention and how many

 5   years it takes them to finish schools if in

 6   fact they're still completing school without

 7   debt?

 8           CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    So thank you

 9   for your question.   And obviously we're very

10   proud of the success we've had over the last

11   couple of years in increasing both our

12   graduation rates and our retention rates.

13   It's been really a remarkable story, both at

14   the community colleges and the four-year

15   colleges, of advancing an agenda of student

16   success, making sure that students keep

17   academic momentum, that they take as many

18   credits that they possibly can, that they

19   stay on track, that we provide support for

20   them.

21           In preparation of the budget, we

22   actually also looked at the past and we

23   looked at the students that were paying

24   out-of-pocket, and we didn't find a direct
                                                      239

 1   correlation between students that were paying

 2   the tuition increases and students that were

 3   stopping out or not graduating.   Right?    So

 4   we're very thoughtful in our analysis to do

 5   that request.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So we know that

 7   you've gotten your -- well, we don't know for

 8   sure, but we think you have resolved your

 9   adjunct situation for a while, that there is

10   capital money for the first time in a while.

11         What if you didn't do an increase in

12   the next couple of years?    What would be the

13   impact on your university?

14         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So the -- let

15   me just make a reference to the adjunct issue

16   because it's something that I know is of

17   interest to many of you, and it's a big

18   concern of mine, and that's why we moved

19   aggressively at the beginning of my tenure to

20   work with the PSC to be able to bring the

21   contract to resolution and, in that, provide

22   a historic increase to the adjuncts.

23         Putting on my hat as a former college

24   president, right, when we moved to the point
                                                       240

 1   where the adjuncts at the lowest rate of

 2   compensation receive $5500 as their salary --

 3   when you do the math, you would not be too

 4   far away of what the salary would be for a

 5   full-time lecturer.    Right?

 6            So it is my hope and it was part of

 7   the aspiration of this contract that you

 8   begin to see a move of having the campuses,

 9   for example, hire more full-time faculty --

10   the full-time lecturers are part of the

11   full-time faculty -- in a way that advances

12   student success and makes us to be less

13   dependent on adjuncts.

14            So the contract was both a way to do

15   justice to the adjuncts in terms of payment

16   but also part of our longer-term strategy to

17   sort of bring down the reliance on the number

18   of adjuncts and continue to increase the

19   number of full-time faculty that we have.

20            As I mentioned before, every year we

21   do an analysis of where our fiscal needs are

22   and what we would need to be able to get

23   there.    And in the past there's been times in

24   which we have decided to go ahead with
                                                         241

 1   tuition increases; there have been times when

 2   we have decided not to do that.

 3            The tuition revenue this year that we

 4   get at the senior colleges is 36 million.

 5   Right?    So if you can project that moving

 6   forward, there would be a comfortable amount

 7   in the outlying years that we have to be able

 8   to address to be able to think about

 9   different forms of tuition increases or not.

10            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So you don't

11   necessarily have to know this now, but I'm

12   very interested in you getting back to us.

13   You know how many students came in on

14   Excelsior scholarship so far.      It wasn't that

15   many.

16            If we jump 125 to 135 to 150 in three

17   years, can you project for us, one, how many

18   additional students that will bring in versus

19   how many students who already were coming and

20   graduating on time will now just get full

21   freight, so to speak, for college?

22            And then I'm assuming that you, CUNY,

23   have to pick up that cost.

24            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    In the TAP gap,
                                                          242

 1   you mean?

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So if another 300

 3   students come in with Excelsior at 125 up,

 4   they've not been eligible for TAP at all up

 5   until now, so they're going to get

 6   100 percent of TAP.   So is that billed

 7   against your colleges, as opposed to the

 8   state comes up with that money separately?

 9         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So we have now

10   about 4500 students in CUNY that benefit from

11   the Excelsior program.   And our estimate is

12   about another $1,400 when the eligibility

13   moves to the $150,000 in household income.       I

14   have to make sure I get those numbers right.

15         The 400,000 is an estimate based on

16   the number of students currently that their

17   families make that amount.    I think it's fair

18   to estimate that there might be another

19   number of students who now are not thinking

20   of CUNY as an option, right, who might

21   consider CUNY as an option as a result of

22   Excelsior, who are in that bandwidth that now

23   are deciding to go elsewhere.   And making a

24   projection of that is really tricky.
                                                          243

 1            So the number that we share with you

 2   is a number based on the number of students

 3   that we do have now that fit that household

 4   income data.

 5            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     So I'm from

 6   Manhattan, so whenever anybody talks about

 7   building anything, we're talking air rights.

 8            Are we talking that you can count air

 9   rights against the half that you have to come

10   up with to get the matching money from the

11   state?

12            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    That if you

13   count air rights --

14            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Against -- so you

15   have this two-to-one match assignment for the

16   capital money.    So in Manhattan, almost

17   anything that gets built as a public

18   building, a public amenity, has some piece of

19   an air-rights deal tied into it.       Is it the

20   assumption that that's what you were going to

21   be working with and that the sale of those

22   air rights will count towards the matching

23   funds you have to come up with?

24            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    That -- I mean,
                                                       244

 1   that is an interesting proposition.    I mean,

 2   if you think about it as a private source,

 3   right, that would count as a private source

 4   because the air rights would come with, you

 5   know, whatever developer or company you're

 6   dealing with.

 7         So we'll definitely suggest that that

 8   kind of creative thinking -- and if you're

 9   doing it -- which is, you know, part of the

10   Manhattan real estate sense, is something

11   that is part of the matching program.

12         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Okay.   And

13   crumbling buildings.   The nursing students on

14   25th Street have been in an untenable

15   situation now for years.   Do you have any

16   good news to share with me?

17         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    We are looking

18   into that as something that we discuss.     And

19   for the public record, I want to show that

20   the Senator is equally committed to those

21   students in the public hearing as she is

22   privately when I went to meet with her in her

23   office.

24         We are also very fortunate, as part of
                                                       245

 1   the new team that we have in the office --

 2   and I think he's in the audience -- Allen

 3   Lew, our new senior vice chancellor for

 4   facilities and planning.   One of the tasks

 5   that he has -- and he is a City College alum

 6   who decided to come back after being the city

 7   manager in D.C. and running all the public

 8   infrastructure programs in D.C.

 9         So he's been charged to begin to look

10   at situations like that to see if we can

11   expedite solutions to be able to advance the

12   situation for the nursing students at Hunter

13   and some of the other capital needs that we

14   have in Hunter and other parts of the city.

15   So it is one of his first assignments as our

16   new senior vice chancellor for facilities and

17   planning.

18         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And how many

19   students live in my district?   I'm feeling a

20   little hurt.

21         (Laughter.)

22         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     No, no, no, no,

23   we have that.

24         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Twenty-eight.
                                                        246

 1   Senate District 28.

 2          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     No, no, I know.

 3          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     It's okay, I

 4   wasn't really trying to put you on the spot.

 5          CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     No, no, no,

 6   this is -- I want to make sure that -- 2,129.

 7   So I want to make sure that you feel the love

 8   too.

 9          (Laughter.)

10          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

11          Toby Stavisky to close.

12          SENATOR STAVISKY:   I'm not going to

13   ask you that question.   Or maybe I will.

14          Since the Governor's -- really for the

15   past year and a quarter that I've been chair

16   of the Higher Ed Committee, I've been meeting

17   with everybody, all aspects of the education

18   community.   And the one theme that I hear, in

19   addition to the underfunding of public higher

20   education, is the TAP gap.     And I hear it

21   from the students, but I hear it from the

22   faculty and I hear it from constituents.

23          How do you propose we deal with the

24   TAP gap?
                                                       247

 1         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     So thank you,

 2   Senator, and --

 3         SENATOR STAVISKY:     You've thanked me

 4   for every question I've asked.

 5         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     To be an

 6   equal-opportunity chancellor, thank you on

 7   behalf of the 11,268 CUNY students that live

 8   in your district.   And which used to be --

 9         SENATOR STAVISKY:     You mean CUNY

10   students --

11         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     CUNY students

12   in your district, yes.

13         The TAP gap is a concern.     If you look

14   at our budget request, it is one of the

15   things that we addressed.    And we propose a

16   scale way to sort of get back to restore that

17   number, which would be projected at

18   $86 million next year.   Our request was

19   $9 million to begin.

20         And again, that is something which,

21   you know, we recognize that presents a sort

22   of a structural issue.   And we look forward

23   to working with all of you in trying to

24   address that.
                                                      248

 1         SENATOR STAVISKY:    We brought up the

 2   issue of students learning in temporary

 3   facilities, whether they be trailers or

 4   prefab buildings or whatever.    Can you give

 5   us a number -- I'm sure you don't have it at

 6   hand -- how many classes are being taught or

 7   how many students are being taught in these

 8   temporary structures?

 9         Because the testimony from -- I think

10   it was the student leaders, I think it was

11   Medgar Evers, if I'm not mistaken, at the

12   December 16th hearing, was very compelling.

13         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     And I received

14   your letter after the hearing.    Thank you.

15   And we're getting the information for that.

16   And I can get you that information.

17         SENATOR STAVISKY:    And lastly, it was

18   discussed a little this afternoon the issues

19   concerning the mental health fee that is

20   being charged the students.   Which I must

21   tell you, it seems to me this is an issue

22   that should be borne by the college, not by

23   the recipients of the services.   And that's

24   really what's happening.
                                                       249

 1         And I think the students themselves

 2   throughout the hearings, whether it be in

 3   Buffalo from SUNY students, in Syracuse, we

 4   went to New Paltz, we went to Brooklyn

 5   College, Nassau Community College, 250

 6   Broadway.    And mental health issues have been

 7   a rising concern, particularly in today's day

 8   and age.    And I really urge you to try to

 9   resolve that issue without charging the

10   students for the fee.

11         And lastly, along those lines, we had

12   a pilot project where students were able to

13   work with other students, graduate students

14   in psychology were able to -- I think it was

15   teleconferencing, and I think they used

16   Upstate Medical School students to try to

17   provide services, really a listening device,

18   I guess, for students with mental health

19   issues.     And I think this is an issue that

20   calls for creative solutions.

21         And I thank you, and I thank the

22   chairs.

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

24         Assembly.
                                                       250

 1            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Just to close,

 2   I would be remiss if I didn't say if it

 3   wasn't for Brooklyn College, I probably

 4   wouldn't be here.    Both my parents were

 5   graduates at a time when obviously it was --

 6   tuition was free.

 7            And I think some of those buildings

 8   they took classes in are still there and

 9   probably need some of this capital

10   improvement.    So I appreciate your work

11   there.

12            A question about Brooklyn College.

13   There's a program, Lifelong Learning, which

14   has allowed seniors to come and take classes,

15   really courses.    It's not -- they run their

16   own courses, lectures.   And it was very

17   popular.    They lost their space at Brooklyn

18   College.    So perhaps we can work together to

19   find a way for them to have some space.

20            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   What is the

21   name of the program?

22            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   It's called

23   Brooklyn Lifelong Learning.

24            CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:   Thank you.
                                                       251

 1         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     So it was local

 2   people would come and teach a program, teach

 3   a class.   They were using the space on the

 4   campus, and it was very worthwhile.

 5         And I know you didn't tell me the

 6   numbers of how many students I have, but I

 7   know I have some of the highest numbers of

 8   CUNY students in Brooklyn.

 9         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Four thousand

10   two hundred and seventy-seven.

11         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     And they are

12   very good students.    And I have -- I think

13   most of my staff actually are CUNY graduates,

14   for either undergraduate or actually with

15   master's degrees.   So I know the kind of

16   quality of learning that goes on over the

17   years at CUNY.   And obviously we're committed

18   to make sure that continues for the next

19   generation of students.

20         Thank you for being here.

21         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:     Thank you for

22   your support.    I'll look at the information

23   about that program and get back to you.     And

24   thank you also for being such a great higher
                                                      252

 1   ed ally over the years.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    So that's it.

 5   We're finished with questions.      And to the

 6   extent that there are any follow-ups, we'll

 7   share them with all the members.

 8         CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ:    Thank you.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Our next

10   witness, as people are leaving, is going to

11   be the New York State Education Department's

12   Interim Commissioner, Shannon Tahoe.

13         (Pause.)

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Commissioner,

15   why don't you begin.   Thank you.

16         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:      Good

17   afternoon, Chairs Krueger, Weinstein,

18   Stavisky and Glick and members of the Senate

19   and Assembly here today.   My name is Shannon

20   Tahoe, and I am the Interim Commissioner of

21   Education.

22         I am joined today at the table by

23   Senior Deputy Commissioner for P-20 John

24   D'Agati, Chief Financial Officer Phyllis
                                                       253

 1   Morris, Deputy Commissioner for the Office of

 2   the Professions Doug Lentivech, and Deputy

 3   Commissioner for the Office of Adult Career

 4   and Continuing Education Services Kevin

 5   Smith.

 6            You have my full testimony before you.

 7            Before I begin, I also want to welcome

 8   members of the Board of Regents who are in

 9   the audience today, including Chancellor

10   Rosa, Regent Cashin, and Regent Mead.

11            The Regents' priorities in higher

12   education are laser-focused on equity and

13   access to postsecondary education

14   opportunities, particularly for our

15   underrepresented students.    We know from

16   multiple indicators college completion leads

17   to better employment opportunities and higher

18   income.

19            In order to support this critical

20   priority of increasing equity and access, as

21   you can see on slides 3 through 7, the

22   Regents recommend an increase of $10 million

23   for our Higher Education Opportunity

24   Programs.    These programs provide access to
                                                     254

 1   postsecondary education for students who are

 2   at the highest risk of either not graduating

 3   from high school, not attending college, or

 4   not completing a degree.

 5         We were pleased to see that the

 6   Executive Budget proposal included last

 7   year's additional funding for these programs

 8   in this year's proposed amount.   Over 39,000

 9   students are served by one of these programs.

10   We would reach even more students across the

11   state with these additional recommended

12   investments.

13         Under our CSTEP and STEP programs, for

14   example, we would provide students with

15   opportunities to participate in STEM-based

16   research, internships or exploratory career

17   opportunities at area facilities.

18         We appreciate the strong support you

19   have demonstrated for our Opportunity

20   Programs.   These programs work, and your

21   support and funding has made a difference.

22         Another Regents priority proposal

23   aimed at increasing equity and access,

24   described on Slide 8, is to enhance supports
                                                     255

 1   and services for postsecondary success of the

 2   over 75,000 individuals with disabilities

 3   attending New York State institutions of

 4   higher education.

 5         The Regents are requesting a

 6   $15 million grant program that would be

 7   designed to supplement funding for support

 8   and accommodations of individuals with

 9   disabilities, support summer college

10   preparation programs to assist individuals

11   with disabilities with the transition to

12   college, provide full- and part-time college

13   faculty and staff with disability training,

14   and improve the identification process of

15   individuals with disabilities and enhanced

16   data collection capabilities.

17         Another priority related to ensuring

18   equity and access in higher education is on

19   page 9, the Readers Aid Program, which

20   provides funding to institutions of higher

21   education on behalf of students who are

22   blind, deaf, deaf-blind or hard of hearing.

23         Thanks to your support, in 2017 the

24   Legislature and Executive provided an
                                                        256

 1   increase in the amount of the maximum

 2   reimbursement rate per student and allowed

 3   for the purchase of assistive technology.

 4   Last year over 200 students from 28 colleges

 5   and the universities received Readers Aid

 6   funding.

 7         Unfortunately, the current annual

 8   appropriation for this program is

 9   insufficient to meet the needs of the

10   increased number of eligible students.      That

11   is why the Regents are requesting a total of

12   $1 million to serve approximately

13   400 students per year.   We need to start this

14   critical conversation of how, as a state, we

15   can better support individuals with

16   disabilities to be successful in college.

17         Continuing with our focus on equity

18   and access, one of the top Regents priorities

19   is funding programs that support teacher

20   diversity in our classrooms.   This means

21   ensuring access to higher education as well

22   as recruiting, preparing and supporting

23   students in teacher and leader preparation

24   programs and thereafter.
                                                      257

 1         Aligned with the department's December

 2   2019 Educator Diversity Report, on Slides 10

 3   and 11 we emphasize the need for our teaching

 4   workforce to be as diverse as our student

 5   population.   Our Teacher Opportunity Corps II

 6   program has been funded by the My Brother's

 7   Keeper initiative, and we want to thank all

 8   of you again, especially Speaker Heastie.

 9         We are asking for $3 million in new

10   funding to establish a separately

11   appropriated Teacher Opportunity Corps II

12   program to increase the number of certified

13   educators of color, who are underrepresented

14   and underserved in the teaching profession.

15   This program also aims to better prepare

16   teachers to address the learning needs of

17   students in high-need districts and to become

18   culturally responsive and sustaining

19   educators.

20         To address teacher diversity needs,

21   the Board of Regents also recommends that

22   $2.5 million in funding be provided to create

23   innovative birth to Grade 3 teacher

24   preparation programs and birth to Grade 12
                                                     258

 1   teacher leader programs.   These programs

 2   would better serve as transformational models

 3   through collaborations between institutions

 4   of higher education, school districts,

 5   community-based organizations, and health and

 6   mental health systems.   This funding would

 7   provide opportunities for approximately

 8   240 individuals from New York State

 9   historically underrepresented and underserved

10   populations to become teachers and leaders.

11            Finally, in order to eliminate

12   potential barriers and to promote teacher

13   diversity and encourage more candidates to

14   join the teaching profession, the Regents

15   have prioritized, on Slide 12, $1.2 million

16   in new funding to provide more fee-waiver

17   vouchers to assist economically disadvantaged

18   students to pay for their certification

19   exams.

20            As you negotiate this budget, please

21   remember that our workforce and the workforce

22   pipeline are the state's most important

23   investment.    A state-of-the-art workforce

24   pipeline does not depend only on traditional
                                                      259

 1   college pathways.   Ensuring equity and access

 2   to other successful pathways for our

 3   out-of-school youth and adults is also a

 4   priority of the Board of Regents.

 5         As you can see on Slide 13, the

 6   Regents are requesting a $3 million

 7   investment in Bridge Programs to enable

 8   out-of-school youth and adults to obtain

 9   essential basic skills, a high school

10   equivalency diploma, industry-recognized

11   credentials, and preparation for

12   postsecondary study and careers.

13         The programs would consist of

14   partnerships between an adult education

15   program and colleges or training providers of

16   demonstrated effectiveness.   This proposal

17   could pilot up to 10 Bridge Programs across

18   New York State.

19         Ensuring public health and safety of

20   New Yorkers and enhancing customer service in

21   our Office of Professions are the final

22   priority areas of the Board of Regents that I

23   would like to highlight today.   On Slides 14

24   through 18, we provide you with updates on
                                                     260

 1   the efforts of the Office of Professions as

 2   our work and responsibilities continue to

 3   grow in this area.

 4         In the last two years, the Office of

 5   Professions has seen a 10 percent increase in

 6   the number of new licenses issued.   Notably,

 7   this included approximately 6,000 additional

 8   applicants from non-registered programs whose

 9   education must be individually reviewed,

10   increasing this workload by 50 percent.

11         These increased responsibilities and

12   complex reviews, coupled with challenges in

13   hiring, training and retaining qualified

14   staff to replace positions lost due to

15   retirement, promotion and previous budget

16   constraints, have made it challenging to

17   timely meet the growing demands placed on

18   this office.

19         I want to bring particular attention

20   to this office's modernization and electronic

21   licensing activities on Slides 17 and 18,

22   which, when fully implemented, will help to

23   improve cycle times in both licensure and

24   discipline.
                                                     261

 1         In 2009, the Legislature and Executive

 2   approved a 15 percent registration fee

 3   increase so that we could replace a

 4   30-year-old COBOL-based licensing system and

 5   enhance our customer service.   We have begun

 6   that work and are using these funds to

 7   develop user-friendly online applications in

 8   nearly 50 professions, implement a more

 9   robust call center, and begin the complex

10   work to replace our antiquated mainframe

11   system.

12         We ask for your support in the

13   Executive Budget proposal to allow us to use

14   $25.4 million in capital spending authority

15   to continue these efforts.

16         Finally, on Slide 21, we ask the

17   Legislature to pass and the Governor to enact

18   the enhanced disciplinary authority bill, to

19   ensure we can protect patients and consumers

20   in a timely manner while still maintaining

21   important due process protections.

22         This bill would provide the department

23   with similar authority already granted to the

24   Department of Health's OPMC to authorize the
                                                     262

 1   commissioner or his or her designee to order

 2   a temporary suspension of practice privileges

 3   when there is an imminent danger to public

 4   health or safety, require all licensed

 5   professionals to report moral character

 6   issues upon application for licensure, and

 7   require that all licensed professionals

 8   report to SED any record of conviction of a

 9   crime in a timely manner.

10         Before I take your questions, we want

11   to thank you all for the opportunity to

12   discuss our priorities and for your support

13   last year.   We look forward to working with

14   you again on our shared goals and in this

15   important discussion.

16         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

17         We go to Deborah Glick.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    First of all,

19   thank you very much for your very

20   comprehensive presentation.   Lots of the

21   questions that one might ask -- how many

22   programs, how many students -- you have in

23   there, as well as the additional requests

24   that you need.
                                                           263

 1            Overall, since the Opportunity

 2   Programs you've asked for additional

 3   resources in a number of these areas.     And

 4   you may not have this immediately, but how

 5   many slots are you short in these different

 6   areas?     You're asking for a certain amount of

 7   money so you can add -- I don't know if it's

 8   students or programs, so --

 9            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Sure.    So

10   we have four Higher Education Opportunity

11   Programs.     First is our Liberty Partnerships

12   Program.     We're requesting a $2 million

13   increase to provide projects with the

14   opportunity to serve an additional 1300

15   students for Liberty Partnerships.

16            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Okay.   I see

17   that's down in the -- thank you.

18            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Yes.

19            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   The student ed

20   programs, some years ago linked to the

21   measuring teachers by student test scores --

22   one of the things that got slipped in was the

23   requirement that in order to get into a

24   master's program in order to be a teacher,
                                                        264

 1   you needed a 3.0.    We put in a bill to

 2   eliminate that because, you know, we think

 3   that there probably are people with a 3.2 who

 4   really can communicate information to

 5   students.    But somebody who may have taken a

 6   tough course early in their career in

 7   college, maybe they have a 2.8, but they are

 8   dynamic, they're engaging, they're

 9   motivating -- and yet they can't get into a

10   program.

11            Do you have any thoughts about whether

12   there's going to be a teacher shortage, if we

13   have a teacher shortage, if we are making it

14   impossible for qualified students to get into

15   these programs to address a teacher shortage?

16            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    I think

17   this is one of the main priorities of the

18   Board of Regents and the department for this

19   coming year.

20            I think teacher shortages is a major

21   issue.    I think it's a statewide issue.      I

22   also think it's a regional issue.      We're

23   seeing certain shortage areas at the state

24   level that are common across like special ed
                                                       265

 1   and bilingual.    We also have individual areas

 2   in pockets of the state where they have

 3   individualized regional needs and regional

 4   shortages in certain subject and

 5   certification areas.

 6            One of the things we're working on

 7   internally is talking to our higher education

 8   partners about ways in which they can

 9   communicate directly with school districts in

10   their regional areas to say where are your

11   demands, or where are your needs?   Let us

12   support you in these areas and try to work on

13   creating teacher education pipelines for the

14   shortages that exist in those regionalized

15   areas.    This is something the department is

16   very committed to.

17            We're also engaging in a workgroup

18   across the state, and the ECB is about to put

19   out recommendations on the teacher shortage

20   issue.    We're looking at those

21   recommendations and creating a statewide

22   workgroup with all of our stakeholders to

23   come up with solutions on specific statewide

24   issues as well as how to resolve those
                                                      266

 1   regional issues that are appearing throughout

 2   the state.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   I think that

 4   there was some desire not to erode standards.

 5   I think the department sort of went to war a

 6   little bit, if you'll pardon the expression,

 7   over allowing charter schools to just certify

 8   their own teachers.

 9           So do you see some sort of disconnect

10   between this policy?   Have you had outreach

11   from campuses around the state complaining

12   about this restriction on accepting students

13   based on the 3.0?

14           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Right.

15   On the 3.0 specifically, I'll refer to John

16   D'Agati, our deputy commissioner for P-20, on

17   that.

18           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Good to see you

19   back, John.

20           (Laughter.)

21           DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:    Thank

22   you, Assemblymember.

23           If I recall correctly, the 3.0

24   provided -- it was put in place, but it also
                                                        267

 1   provided an opportunity to -- if you had --

 2   it did provide flexibility in that if you had

 3   students who didn't quite meet that, you had

 4   like a 15 percent -- 15 percent of your

 5   admits did not have to meet that requirement.

 6         So I have not -- recently I have not

 7   heard that as being a barrier to getting into

 8   graduate programs.   I haven't -- nobody's

 9   reached out to me to say directly that that's

10   causing people not to be able to get in.

11         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Okay.     You have

12   a lot of information here on the e-licensing.

13   That -- there is some additional capital

14   provided.   What more will that do?

15         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:      The

16   $25.4 million in additional spending

17   authority, that's through fees we've already

18   collected through our registration and

19   licensure fees.   It's just a spending.

20         That additional fee, we are looking to

21   do a comprehensive OP modernization of our

22   website, our application process.     What we're

23   looking to do is have an automated system

24   wherein essentially applicants for any of our
                                                     268

 1   over 50 licensed professions can go online,

 2   they can upload their different, varying

 3   educational documents, experience documents.

 4   And there would almost be -- the computer is

 5   going -- it's a system where it's going to be

 6   able to automatically, essentially, be able

 7   to tell whether or not they've met the

 8   licensure requirements in some of these

 9   cases, which will streamline our backlogs and

10   our situations where we have, you know,

11   significant delays in the licensure process.

12         We're also creating a comprehensive

13   new call center and redoing our complete

14   website modernization for the Office of

15   Professions.   So it would do all of those

16   things.

17         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    I suspect that

18   this will be an answer from Doug.

19         There are several proposals in the

20   Executive Budget regarding changes to

21   professions that would normally go through

22   the Legislature.   There was an article just

23   last week, I think, in the New York Times,

24   fairly extensively, about concerns that
                                                          269

 1   pharmacists, particularly those who work for

 2   chains -- which in a lot of places are the

 3   only game in town -- are concerned about the

 4   metrics that are being used.    They have to

 5   have X number of contacts with people, they

 6   have to produce X number of refills.       Doctors

 7   are saying, I don't want to refill that

 8   prescription, and they're getting these calls

 9   from pharmacists who are required to make the

10   calls.

11            And the proposals focused on pharmacy

12   seem to expand the number of people who a

13   pharmacist would have to supervise.

14            Are there any concerns that the

15   department has about proceeding in the budget

16   with proposals that -- we've hardly measured

17   the changes we made with pharmacy techs in

18   the last session.    Do you have any concerns

19   about we're moving too quickly on some of

20   this?

21            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   Yes,

22   Chair Glick.    And I think that's -- thank you

23   for bringing that up.

24            I think some of these proposals are
                                                       270

 1   really included in the budget proposal which

 2   actually need more intensive thought.    And we

 3   have some technical concerns with a lot of

 4   the Office of Professions bills that are

 5   currently embedded in the Executive proposal,

 6   and we would work with the Legislature on

 7   solutions to those problems.

 8            But we do find that sometimes it's

 9   best to put it out of the budget

10   conversation.

11            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   So you would

12   recommend that the Legislature sort of say,

13   you know, let's have this conversation

14   post-budget and vet these.

15            Have you had any opportunity to review

16   what we've already done in terms of pharmacy

17   techs?

18            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   Yes, we

19   have.    Currently the pharmacy techs are

20   limited to the Article 28 institutions, and

21   the Executive proposal bill would expand that

22   and allow registered pharm techs outside of

23   the Article 28 facilities.

24            This is something that we're greatly
                                                     271

 1   concerned with.   We're just getting off the

 2   ground with initial enactment of the pharmacy

 3   tech bill for Article 28 facilities, and we'd

 4   like an opportunity to see how that goes

 5   first before expanding that any further.

 6         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Are there other

 7   issues that impact your department that

 8   where -- that in the course of the budget,

 9   other than these dollar figures that you've

10   included, that you think we should be paying

11   attention to?

12         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   Yes.    I

13   think any time the Legislature adds a new

14   program or a requirement on SED, we would

15   respectfully request a 5 percent set-aside of

16   funds for those programs to be administered

17   so that the department could have, you know,

18   sufficient funds to administratively provide

19   the oversight and monitoring that are

20   necessary to implement these new programs

21   with fidelity.

22         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you.

23         And I just want to thank you -- the

24   staff is always very available, and they're
                                                       272

 1   very helpful in working through some of the

 2   questions that we have or getting us an

 3   answer if they are, you know, unable to do it

 4   personally.    So I want to thank you for the

 5   close association.

 6            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   Thank

 7   you, Chair Glick.

 8            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Thank you.

 9            We now go to the Senate Higher Ed

10   chair, Toby Stavisky.

11            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

12            And thank you for what you're doing

13   during the -- I guess you could almost call

14   it the interregnum.    I think the department

15   has been really responsive and helpful on so

16   many occasions.    And perhaps we forget to say

17   thank you, but we do appreciate it.

18            And I too have concerns about the

19   question of pharmacy techs, because we did

20   pass the bill and it was chaptered last year,

21   but it dealt only with hospital pharmacy

22   techs.    And in fact, until that time, there

23   was no definition of what a pharmacy tech is

24   or could do, what their scope could be, and
                                                       273

 1   how many a licensed pharmacists could

 2   supervise.

 3         And I'm a little troubled by the

 4   proposal in -- I believe it's the Health and

 5   Mental Hygiene Law, which does talk about a

 6   pharmacist supervising six technicians.    And

 7   I think your position --

 8         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:      Yes, we

 9   share those concerns.   And we would like to

10   actually get the chapter that was enacted

11   last year off the ground before expanding it

12   in any way so we can determine the impact of,

13   you know, the new profession itself.

14         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Without question.

15         And that took a long period of time of

16   negotiation with all of the stakeholders.

17   And to put it in the budget like this I think

18   is maybe doing our consumers a disservice.

19         I have a couple of other questions.

20   What's not in your presentation,

21   incidentally, is the issue of the CPAs.     And

22   I was curious because it talks about the

23   $300 fee.    Would that fee go to SED or into

24   the General Fund?
                                                       274

 1         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     Thank you

 2   for raising that very important point,

 3   Senator.

 4         That provision for the public

 5   licensure accounting firms -- obviously we've

 6   been working with the Legislature over the

 7   last couple of years on that proposal and

 8   will continue to do so and provide our

 9   comments and support on that proposal.

10         However, we are very concerned with

11   the fee, because the fee will be going right

12   to the General Fund, even though the State

13   Education Department is responsible for

14   administering and overseeing the public

15   licensure firms.   So that is something that

16   is very concerning to us.    Thank you.

17         SENATOR STAVISKY:     And do you see

18   associated costs that would be incurred by

19   the department as a result of that fee,

20   implementation of that fee?

21         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     Yes,

22   there will be significant costs on the

23   department for overseeing that program

24   without -- if we don't receive those fees.
                                                        275

 1            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.   You

 2   didn't mention it in your presentation.

 3            Getting back to the pharmacy tech

 4   issue -- and I saw the story in the New York

 5   Times, it was last Saturday.       And it was, I

 6   know, a front page and then a two-page

 7   full-page spread in the Times about the

 8   mistakes that are being made, particularly in

 9   the chain pharmacies.

10            Do you want to comment?    I'm not sure

11   we have that problem in New York; it was

12   primarily reported throughout the country.

13   But it's certainly something that could

14   develop here.    Has anybody seen the story

15   and --

16            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Yes, we

17   have seen the stories.    And I will actually

18   ask Doug Lentivech, our deputy commissioner

19   for the Office of Professions, to respond to

20   that.

21            DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LENTIVECH:    Thank

22   you.    We see pharmacy discipline cases on a

23   regular basis in New York, as they do in

24   every state.
                                                       276

 1         And, you know, it's a very challenging

 2   profession, because what you go to a

 3   pharmacist for is being exact and detailed in

 4   what you're asking for.   It's like if you

 5   have a prescription for a certain medication

 6   and for a certain dosage of that medication,

 7   you want that dosage and you want that

 8   medication to be in the vial.   And most of us

 9   are not sophisticated enough to protect

10   ourselves, so that's what we look for.

11         As the demands of the practice, of

12   the -- and in pharmacies, these are corporate

13   practitioners.   These are not PCs or PLLCs,

14   these are corporate practitioners.    And

15   they're very expansive and very large.      And

16   to be competitive in our society, this is a

17   profession that really, really sustains huge

18   demands on their professional time.    And we

19   see these regularly in our disciplinary

20   system, and I don't know that it's different

21   in New York.   But it's something we've been

22   concerned about for a long time.

23         And I think that the proposals before

24   us are something you've got to look at in
                                                      277

 1   terms of those constraints are being put on

 2   our licensees.

 3         SENATOR STAVISKY:    And I assume, on a

 4   totally different issue -- but I'm sure you

 5   remember discussions during budget hearings

 6   of the processing time for some of these

 7   applications.    I assume that the time has

 8   increased dramatically, am I correct, the

 9   time is takes SED to process?

10         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     So that

11   is something we're looking at very seriously,

12   Senator.   It's something that we have

13   actually shifted resources to.   Where we have

14   backlogs in our Office of Professions, we're

15   actually taking staff from other units and

16   targeting them toward the backlogs.    We've

17   been paying overtime for individuals to get

18   through the backlog.

19         As we stated before, with the

20   $25.4 million investment in our OP

21   Modernization Act, we believe that that's

22   going to dramatically reduce the online

23   processing because it will all be automated

24   instead of paper.
                                                        278

 1         Also, we have noticed a significant

 2   increase in the number -- we went from 10,000

 3   to 16,000 applications from non-New York-

 4   registered programs, so individuals coming in

 5   from out of state or a foreign country, where

 6   it takes a significant amount of time to

 7   review those educational credentials to

 8   ensure that they meet the requirements of our

 9   licensure requirements.     This takes -- it's a

10   very timely process, and so that has been a

11   dramatic increase in the number of

12   applications too.

13         But like I said, this is a priority

14   for the department.   We are targeting

15   resources in that area, doing everything we

16   possibly can to address the backlogs, because

17   we know individuals deserve timely feedback

18   on their applications.

19         SENATOR STAVISKY:     Thank you.   Because

20   I represent -- well, Queens County is a

21   county with a lot of immigrants and a lot of

22   people who practice various professions in

23   other parts of the world.    They come here to

24   live, and it is important to process their
                                                       279

 1   applications in a timely fashion.

 2         Two more quick questions.     Number one,

 3   the time it takes to process approval

 4   programs for new programs at colleges.     I

 5   spoke to Commissioner D'Agati -- and it's

 6   great to see you back -- about this just

 7   before -- I guess it was last year.    And

 8   others have complained that it takes colleges

 9   a long time to get approval on new programs.

10         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     This is

11   another issue which sometimes people forget

12   exactly what we're trying to make sure.      We

13   want to ensure that the students that are in

14   these programs receive a quality education

15   and that their tuition is going to good use.

16         And sometimes when we're receiving

17   these new program approvals, we're looking at

18   it from the bottom up.   We're looking at the

19   entire curriculum for every program that they

20   wish to offer, the resources within the

21   institution to ensure that they have the

22   stability that the institution needs to best

23   serve those students.    We're looking at the

24   administration, the faculty, to make sure
                                                     280

 1   that they're being taught by competent,

 2   qualified teachers.   This is an extensive

 3   review.   We're also doing site visits at the

 4   campuses to ensure that what's happening on

 5   the ground is what's reflected in their

 6   application.

 7         So yes, it does take a significant --

 8   you know, it's a timely and detailed process.

 9   But again, we have actually streamlined our

10   process in the last couple of years under

11   Leslie Templeman, our director in that unit.

12   And I think -- I'm really proud of the

13   efforts that that unit has made in improving

14   their times on these program approvals.

15         But yes, you're right, oftentimes some

16   of them do take a longer amount of time.

17   We're going back and forth for additional

18   information from the individuals and the

19   applicants and the institutions of higher

20   education.   Sometimes we don't get all the

21   information we need up-front and we have to

22   keep going back and forth with the

23   institution until we get what we need to

24   ensure that that's a quality program for
                                                        281

 1   these kids.

 2           SENATOR STAVISKY:   It was suggested

 3   that there be a blind kind of study with

 4   names and specifics redacted, and then use

 5   volunteer administrators at various colleges

 6   for approval or preliminary approval to cut

 7   down on some of the time-consuming approval

 8   process.    And I had spoken to Commissioner

 9   D'Agati about this.

10           And I still think it's a way of making

11   sure that nobody knows the college

12   involved -- because you certainly don't want

13   to have your competition, so to speak,

14   approved.     But on the other hand, you do want

15   to approve the applications.    And I think we

16   should talk further about this.

17           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   This is

18   something we would be a little concerned

19   with.   We'd want to make sure of consistency

20   in the review of the applications and ensure,

21   as you indicated, that your competitors

22   aren't reviewing your application.    So we

23   would want to make sure of that.

24           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you very
                                                        282

 1   much.   And welcome to the Regents.

 2           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Thank you

 3   so much.

 4           SENATOR STAVISKY:   Tomorrow we're

 5   interviewing future Regents.

 6           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Yes.

 7           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 8   Senator Seward.

 9           SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you.

10           I just wanted to follow up on the

11   question that Senator Stavisky has been

12   asking about, the approval process for new

13   programs for our colleges.     Is there an

14   average time frame for new program approval

15   that you can share with us?     I know obviously

16   it may vary, depending.     But this is a --

17   continues to be a concern that we hear from

18   colleges, is the length of time.

19           And do you have an average time frame

20   for approvals?

21           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    I

22   don't -- I think it would depend on the type

23   of program approval and for which specific

24   type of registered program.
                                                          283

 1         But I will defer to John D'Agati, our

 2   deputy commissioner for higher education.       He

 3   may have more insight.

 4         SENATOR SEWARD:    I guess what I'm

 5   asking is, has the time frame improved or

 6   been shortened?

 7         DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:   I think,

 8   since we've streamlined the application

 9   process, it has improved significantly.     I

10   think where we -- as Commissioner Tahoe

11   mentioned, some applications come to us

12   incomplete, some are more complicated.

13         And also, to make a distinction when

14   it's a program that is being reviewed by the

15   Office of Professions where licensure is

16   involved, there's even a more detailed review

17   than what we would do as a general, you know,

18   English program, for example.   So there are

19   distinctions to be made in terms of the

20   application and the processes that it goes

21   through.

22         But, you know, some applications

23   are -- come in, they're complete, and they're

24   reviewed within 30 days, and it goes through.
                                                          284

 1   Others take somewhat longer.    Others, because

 2   there's, you know, a lack of information, we

 3   need more detail, or there's concerns about

 4   who's teaching the courses, whether or not

 5   they're qualified or not, they take longer.

 6         SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you, John.       And

 7   it seems just like yesterday you were behind

 8   us here whispering in our ears.

 9         (Laughter.)

10         DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:      I know.

11         SENATOR SEWARD:   One final question on

12   proprietary colleges.   Are there new

13   regulations being considered in regard to our

14   proprietary colleges?

15         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     We have

16   heard there may be new regulations.     We have

17   not seen those regulations.    Obviously, it

18   would depend on the details of what those

19   regulations said, you know, what our position

20   would be on those.

21         However, I would say that our

22   proprietary colleges -- I think we have 24 in

23   the state at this moment.   And the graduation

24   rate at our proprietary colleges is at I
                                                      285

 1   think 44 or 45 percent, which is higher than

 2   the nationwide average for proprietary

 3   schools.

 4          As we've indicated before, our program

 5   approval for our proprietary schools is just

 6   as robust as any other higher education

 7   institution in this state.   So we believe

 8   State Ed has, you know, significant oversight

 9   and accountability for these institutions.

10   So we would be, you know, wary of any

11   proposal, you know, as to what that would

12   look like.   But I would need to see the

13   details of any regulation first.

14          SENATOR SEWARD:   Where would those

15   regulations come from, if not from you?

16          INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    That's a

17   great question.   I would think that they

18   would be coming from SED if there were going

19   to be regulations on this.   But we have heard

20   something, as you've mentioned, but we

21   haven't seen them yet.

22          SENATOR SEWARD:   Okay.   Thank you.

23          INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Thank

24   you.

 1          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    We go to

 2   Assemblywoman Simon.

 3          ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Thank you.

 4   Thank you very much.

 5          And welcome to your first budget

 6   hearing.

 8   you.

 9          ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    I wanted to

10   thank you, first of all, for requesting the

11   additional funding to help provide supports

12   and services to students with disabilities in

13   New York schools.   That's an area that has

14   been seriously underfunded for many, many

15   years, and we really need that money.      So I

16   want to thank you for doing that.

17          I also want to ask you a couple of

18   questions about teacher education.    We have

19   identified and we know that there is a real

20   lack of education in our schools of education

21   on how to teach reading to our teachers.      And

22   this is an effort that I've been working on

23   for some time, and I know I've worked with

24   the department in connection with a bill a
                                                      287

 1   few years ago requiring that students with

 2   dyslexia be able to use that word in their

 3   eligibility documents, IEPs, et cetera.

 4         It's very clear that there are two

 5   issues that we need to address.   One is early

 6   identification.   And one good way to do that

 7   is to have teachers recognize the kinds of

 8   errors students are making so that they can

 9   help target instruction and identify those

10   students.

11         And the other is making sure that we

12   actually give our teachers the tools they

13   need in order to do that job.   Fifteen to

14   20 percent of kids have dyslexia or related

15   learning disabilities, but they're in the

16   same first and second grade, the same

17   kindergarten, and the teachers don't know how

18   to help them.

19         So I would like to know what efforts

20   the department is undertaking to ensure that

21   the training that is given to teachers in New

22   York State's teacher education/preparation

23   programs are addressing the science of

24   reading and how we teach reading in this
                                                         288

 1   state.

 2            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   This is

 3   something we're actually looking at right

 4   now, and our Early Child Blue Ribbon

 5   Committee has been evaluating the work in our

 6   birth to Grade 2 certificates in our teacher

 7   preparation programs in early learning.      So I

 8   think this is something we'll be looking at

 9   as we're moving forward with our blue ribbon

10   recommendations for early child learning.

11            This is something -- I agree with you,

12   this is extremely important.     We've also --

13   the department has issued guidance or is

14   working on guidance on dyslexia and the

15   identification of dyslexia.     So this is

16   something our office of Special Ed is

17   currently involved with.    And as I said, on

18   the teacher ed side, this is something we

19   will be reviewing as part of our early child

20   workgroup recommendations and what to do in

21   our birth to Grade 2 pathways.

22            ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   Thank you.   I

23   want to just stress, if I can, that while

24   teachers in special education need this
                                                       289

 1   training as well, it's general ed teachers,

 2   because that's where the kids are so often.

 3           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    You're

 4   absolutely right.

 5           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    And just

 6   ensuring that the work that is done is really

 7   consistent with the science as we know it in

 8   terms of the way the brain works, and that so

 9   many kids need direct instruction in reading

10   who are not necessarily students with

11   disabilities but still need the same methods

12   used in order for them to learn.

13           Thank you.

14           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    You're

15   absolutely right.    Thank you for bringing

16   this to our attention.   And we will

17   definitely consider this as we move forward

18   with our changes to the birth to Grade 2

19   programs.   Thank you.

20           ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Thank you very

21   much.

22           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    Thank

23   you.

24           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    To the Senate.
                                                          290

 1           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Thank you.     Thank

 2   you for being here.    I'm sorry I ran out for

 3   a few minutes.

 4           So you run through your testimony, you

 5   list out a number of different programs for

 6   low-income students going to our colleges and

 7   STEM programs and an additional million here,

 8   an additional 2 million -- very small amounts

 9   of money.

10           Do you agree that college has proved

11   to be the most successful model for helping

12   people move into jobs and out of poverty?

13           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   I

14   think that's an interesting question.       And I

15   think that's something that we're looking

16   at -- I mean, obviously we know and the data

17   reflects, and I think it's reflected in our

18   slides that we provided today, that students

19   who graduate with a high school diploma or a

20   high school equivalency diploma receive

21   1.5 percent more wage earnings than those who

22   do not.     And those with an associate's

23   degree, it's 2 percent more -- or two times

24   more.
                                                     291

 1         So I think that there is some evidence

 2   to show that going through college, you know,

 3   you earn higher wage limitations.

 4         However, I think there's other

 5   pathways as well for students, and that's

 6   something we're considering as part of our

 7   graduation measures project is, you know,

 8   what are the additional pathways or what does

 9   it mean to have an meaningful high school

10   diploma.    And not all kids, as we know, are

11   geared to go to college, and they may have

12   other additional pathways that may suit their

13   needs and keep them in school for longer, you

14   know, through our CTE pathways or additional

15   pathways.

16         So this is something we're actually

17   looking at and reviewing right now with the

18   Regents' graduation measures project.

19         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     But again -- so

20   maybe I asked it slightly wrong, because I'm

21   just pointing out you're talking about

22   serving 500 kids with a million dollars,

23   serving 4450 kids with 4.5 million.

24         Next week, if you want to come back
                                                       292

 1   for our Economic Development Hearing, you'll

 2   hear me asking why are we spending a million

 3   dollars a job, $500 million for 500 jobs at

 4   an LED factory in upstate New York.   And I

 5   just wanted to highlight for the record --

 6   not that you have to answer -- that I think

 7   there's something very wrong with our

 8   priorities when you have to literally beg us

 9   for nickels and dimes for models that have

10   been successful in higher ed, and through our

11   economic development budgets we blow money by

12   the billions.

13         So it's a rhetorical statement, not a

14   question --

15         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     Yes,

16   thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Unless you'd like

18   to jump in and go, you're right, Senator

19   Krueger, that's outrageous.

20         (Laughter.)

21         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     You're

22   absolutely right, Senator Krueger.

23         (Laughter.)

24         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     I would
                                                          293

 1   say that you're absolutely right.     These are

 2   our most successful programs.     And we know

 3   that these kids without these programs,

 4   they're underrepresented youth who they may

 5   never have gone to college, and these

 6   programs keep them in college, give them the

 7   remedial supports that they need while

 8   they're in there, put them into summer

 9   training, giving them, you know, additional

10   supports that they can graduate.

11          So thank you.

12          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.    Thank

13   you.

14          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

15          We go to Assemblyman Epstein.

16          ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Hi.    Good

17   afternoon, and thank you for being here for

18   so long.

19          First I want to thank you for putting

20   the priorities of $15 million in your request

21   for students with disabilities.      And I wanted

22   to see what you thought that $15 million

23   would offer.   Obviously we have 72,000

24   students with identifiable disabilities
                                                       294

 1   across the state, and there's such a huge

 2   need.   And I wonder, do you think

 3   15 million -- what does it get you?    I know

 4   we haven't seen any new money for 20 years.

 5   What are the needs for students with

 6   disabilities right now across the state?    And

 7   how do we ensure that those students who have

 8   disabilities can be successful and graduate

 9   from college and then move on to fulfilling

10   employment?

11           INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:   I think

12   one of the things we're noticing is that

13   we're always worried about students with

14   disabilities in our K-12 world.   And one of

15   the things is that when they get to college,

16   we still need to be worried about those

17   students with disabilities.

18           There's 75,000 individuals with

19   disabilities across this state in our higher

20   education community, and I think what we're

21   seeing is we need -- the 15 million is to do

22   a number of things.   One is to ensure that we

23   have the data collection that we need to know

24   who those kids are, what types of
                                                      295

 1   disabilities they have, what supports are

 2   needed, what are effective supports for those

 3   students.   The monies are also used for

 4   summer training to get those kids who may not

 5   have ever even thought about going to

 6   college, but getting them ready to get it

 7   going and giving them the pre-college

 8   experience they need over the summer to get

 9   them ready for college.   It's also to provide

10   remedial supports and accommodations for

11   those kids once they're in school so that

12   they can be successful in college.

13         So I think it's for a number -- for

14   all of those purposes.

15         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   And 75,000, as

16   you said, students and 15 million, it doesn't

17   seem that we're -- per student, it's not a

18   lot of money.   So --

19         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    It's not

20   a lot of money.   If you'd like to give us

21   more, we would love that too.

22         (Laughter.)

23         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    I'm just

24   kidding.
                                                        296

 1         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    And so I want to

 2   move on to -- and I would love to give you

 3   more, so I -- you know, obviously we're not

 4   the only players in this conversation.     But I

 5   think it's well-needed.

 6         I want to talk more about disclosure

 7   of information you mentioned from proprietary

 8   schools, and the government might be coming

 9   forward with regulations.   But more of my

10   interest is making sure the students across

11   the state have good access to good

12   information, whether they choose to go to a

13   proprietary school, CUNY or SUNY, or a

14   nonprofit institution.

15         Do you feel like there's enough

16   information out there for people to make

17   informed choices about what the default

18   rates are three, five, 10 years out, you

19   know, what money is being spent on student

20   education versus paying for advertising, what

21   money is -- in the for-profit context, how

22   much profit is being taken out of the system?

23         I wanted to get a sense of if there's

24   enough public disclosure for students to make
                                                       297

 1   informed choices around decisions they're

 2   making.

 3            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    I think

 4   more public disclosure is always best.     And

 5   the more transparent you can be so that

 6   students know exactly where they're going and

 7   what they're going to get out of their

 8   educational experience, I think that's always

 9   helpful.

10            I'll turn to John D'Agati as well, our

11   deputy commissioner for P-20, to see if he

12   has any additional thoughts on this.

13            DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:   Yeah, I

14   do believe there's a lot of information out

15   there.    I worry that people don't always know

16   where to go to find it.    But there is an

17   abundance of information about graduation

18   rates, about employment, about costs

19   associated with attending.

20            But oftentimes people don't know how

21   to access it.    And we probably in the

22   department can help with that in trying to

23   consolidate a lot of that information and put

24   it someplace where it's easily accessible and
                                                     298

 1   also understandable.

 2         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   So when you say

 3   put it someplace, you mean put it on your

 4   website or have the universities put it on

 5   theirs, or what are you thinking?

 6         DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:   All of

 7   the above.   Particularly put it on the

 8   university's website and making it more

 9   readily available.

10         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Yeah, I think

11   that would be really helpful.   Because I --

12   you know, I have actually a daughter in

13   college right now and a son who's in high

14   school, and for their decisions, you know,

15   they -- it wasn't readily accessible to them,

16   like what this would cost them versus like

17   how do you -- you have to compare apples to

18   apples, right, and it's really hard to do

19   that, especially for some institutions, when

20   people don't really understand the options

21   that are available and they don't have

22   parents, you know, who are fortunately

23   educated and can help them navigate the

24   system about loans, what it means, programs,
                                                       299

 1   access, all those things that come up that

 2   people don't really understand.    So great

 3   to -- happy to partner with you on that.

 4         And my last question is I'm really

 5   thinking about dedicated funding for public

 6   education.    So I know we have this dance

 7   where you come ask us for money and then we

 8   have to figure out if we can work with the

 9   Senate and the Assembly and the Governor to

10   get a budget.    What do you think about having

11   a real, dedicated funding stream to go

12   directly to institutions of higher ed and not

13   have to have this dance up here in Albany,

14   there are dedicated streams.

15         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     I will

16   defer to Phyllis Morris, our chief financial

17   officer, on that one.

18         SED CFO MORRIS:    So there's pros and

19   cons to that, as with everything.   If you

20   were to do that, I would just suggest having

21   something very specific in statute that -- so

22   that your intended purpose is actually

23   achievable.

24         Having the funds come to the State
                                                      300

 1   Education Department for distribution, you

 2   know, we can ensure that the funds are

 3   distributed in a way that meets the

 4   legislative intent.   And so that would be the

 5   only caveat we'd put on that.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 7         Assemblywoman Hyndman.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Thank you,

 9   Madam Chair.

10         Commissioner Tahoe, I think you're

11   doing a tremendous job for someone who's

12   interim acting, so you're very knowledgeable.

13         Mr. D'Agati, I thought you left.

14         (Laughter.)

15         DEPUTY COMMISSIONER D'AGATI:    I

16   thought I did too.

17         (Laughter.)

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    They pull you

19   back in.

20         So this is more of an observation over

21   the years.   I note that your proprietary

22   school supervision is under access, under

23   Deputy Commissioner Smith.    It used to be

24   higher ed.
                                                        301

 1         And the reason why I'm bringing this

 2   up is because I know that when it comes to

 3   that sector, there's a lot of misinformation,

 4   there's a lot of lumping proprietary schools,

 5   non-degree-granting, into the degree-granting

 6   proprietary school sector.

 7         And how would we discuss or have an

 8   opportunity to discuss putting that back

 9   under higher ed?   Just because a lot of the

10   legislators don't really know about that

11   sector until there's a problem.   Not you,

12   Chair Glick.   But a lot of us don't -- I

13   do -- a lot of members don't always know

14   about that sector till there's a problem.

15         And it is postsecondary.    We're

16   talking about adults, those who are -- maybe

17   have received a TASC instead of the GED, and

18   those who are looking to change careers.     The

19   information they provide, the amount of jobs

20   that stay in New York State because people

21   have further education.   That's something

22   that used to be under higher ed, and I would

23   really like to talk about how do we get it

24   back under higher ed.   I see Dr. Owen is here
                                                      302

 1   too, so I understand, you know, that this is

 2   a particular area of interest and it's not

 3   under -- and we don't get to really

 4   scrutinize that sector and talk about it as

 5   colleagues, about what those schools are

 6   doing and how they're educating our residents

 7   here in New York State.

 8         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     I think

 9   you're right, we do receive a lot of

10   different questions regarding the differences

11   between our BPSS schools and our proprietary

12   schools and our proprietary colleges.

13   They're two very different things.

14         And so traditionally, you know -- and

15   I will defer to Kevin on this, obviously,

16   because he may have more history than I do on

17   this issue.    But we can definitely work with

18   you on this.

19         But like I said, they are two very

20   different things.   They're -- you know, adult

21   education has traditionally been seen as in

22   our access unit, and that is something where

23   we think of these licensed private career

24   schools as more adult education and getting
                                                     303

 1   them toward careers, where the colleges and

 2   universities are somewhat in a separate world

 3   that are higher education, and that's how

 4   they've been treated.

 5         But this is something we can

 6   definitely explore with you moving forward.

 7   But I would defer --

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:   I also bring

 9   it up because you talk about -- in one of

10   these you talk about alternative pathways.

11   And so I think as New York State, as we've

12   grown and evolved, we're seeing that a lot of

13   students who go and get a four-year degree

14   may not get a job in that career.   Right?

15   And whatever debt or whatever issues that

16   they are dealing with, then they look to that

17   sector to change their career or get a job or

18   make -- the shorter-term training gets them

19   into the workforce.

20         So that's why I do think -- it is

21   different, but we're talking about adults,

22   and we recognize adults as those who are 18

23   who may not go to college and use those

24   schools in order to get into the workforce,
                                                       304

 1   and may go on later -- to get an income, go

 2   on later and then decide to go to a four-year

 3   degree-granting institution later.    That's

 4   why.

 5          INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    You're

 6   bringing up a very good point.    I mean, and

 7   this is something that we can definitely talk

 8   about later.   And I don't know if Kevin has

 9   any additional thoughts on this.

10          DEPUTY COMMISSIONER SMITH:    Well, only

11   to say I know you're not suggesting that you

12   want to move it to higher ed because I'm

13   doing a bad job with it.

14          (Laughter.)

15          ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    No, no.   Not

16   at all.

17          DEPUTY COMMISSIONER SMITH:    Just to

18   give you a sense of size and scope, 391

19   licensed career schools, non-degree, over

20   200,000 students.    Programs, career programs

21   ranging from coding -- which is growing

22   astronomically every day in the New York City

23   metropolitan area and across the state -- a

24   full range of allied health programs, dog
                                                      305

 1   grooming, cosmetology.   You name it, we do it

 2   in the proprietary schools sector.

 3         It is an important postsecondary

 4   destination.    I wish all of our school

 5   counselors would recognize the opportunity to

 6   send and advise students to attend those

 7   programs.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Thank you.

 9         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Assembly?

10         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We go to

11   Assemblywoman Glick to close.

12         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Just to go back

13   to the potential or existing teacher

14   shortage, what are -- and you say you're

15   having conversations with regional partners

16   about what kind of shortages they're facing

17   and so forth.

18         What more can we be doing to -- you

19   know, I'm not sure that people realize that

20   there is a teacher shortage if they don't

21   have kids in school.   That's a large number

22   of the population.   They're older, they don't

23   like paying school taxes as it is, so can't

24   we get by with fewer teachers, and so forth.
                                                      306

 1         So what exactly could or should we be

 2   doing to address this issue, and why do you

 3   think we have a teacher shortage?   What are

 4   the issues that prevent people from pursuing

 5   teaching?

 6         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:      I think

 7   that's a very loaded question and one which I

 8   will answer in several different ways.

 9         First I'll say I think the teaching

10   profession, over the last few years,

11   unfortunately, it doesn't have the reputation

12   that it did once have.   And I think that's

13   the first thing that needs to change.

14         I think the way strategically across

15   the state the way that everyone, including

16   parents, other teachers and administrators in

17   school buildings, it's all in how we think of

18   the profession and treat those teachers and

19   the way that -- the respect that they feel in

20   the classrooms and how we're raising our kids

21   to say going into the teaching profession is,

22   you know, a wonderful thing, you can help

23   other children or students.

24         I think it's the way we talk about the
                                                     307

 1   teaching profession and the teaching

 2   profession in general in the mindset of

 3   people in the education field.

 4         So I think, first thing first, we need

 5   to change the way the profession is viewed in

 6   public.

 7         Secondly, I think that we need to --

 8   State Ed is taking a look at our regulatory

 9   requirements on our certification pathways to

10   see if there's ways in which we can, you

11   know, provide more flexibility, additional

12   pathways for teachers to get certified and

13   licensed in the classroom.

14         I think other ways is our fee voucher

15   program where we're asking for $1.2 million

16   in getting certification fee waivers so that

17   people -- you know, disadvantaged students

18   might be able to take those exams without

19   paying for them, because we've heard that the

20   fees are a barrier.

21         Another issue is I think we're looking

22   at our higher ed institutions and we're

23   talking to them regularly -- and John and I

24   are having conversations about really looking
                                                      308

 1   at the regional needs and trying to ensure

 2   that you're opening teacher ed programs where

 3   there's an actual need, rather than having an

 4   oversupply of early childhood programs.

 5         Looking at if your regional need is

 6   special ed, open a special ed program, open a

 7   bilingual program.    We're really trying to,

 8   you know, have people in programs think about

 9   ways to -- and talking about data sharing.

10   John and I have been discussing ways in which

11   we can try to share data with various

12   regional partners to say:    This is where the

13   needs in your region are, take a look at

14   these needs and try to design programs that

15   meet those needs.

16         And really taking a look at -- we're

17   looking holistically at this, literally how

18   the teaching profession is viewed, our

19   certification requirements, our higher

20   education partners.    We're working with our

21   stakeholder groups to say, you know, how can

22   we make -- how can we change this dynamic?

23         Because something has to change now.

24   We're in severe shortages across the state in
                                                       309

 1   areas where there shouldn't be.   I mean,

 2   special ed and bilingual, we need certified

 3   teachers who are qualified in those areas to

 4   be serving those vulnerable populations of

 5   students.

 6         And this is something that we're very

 7   concerned with and that we are addressing

 8   immediately and taking steps to address

 9   immediately.

10         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Just one area

11   that came to mind was some friends who are,

12   you know, of a certain age -- and so some

13   people actually have the great wisdom to

14   semiretire or actually retire -- who have

15   been college professors, they don't have a

16   certification, they don't have -- they've

17   taught in college, but they haven't taught

18   and gotten a master's in ed.    And they may be

19   in some communities that are short of

20   teachers, and there's no -- they're not, at

21   age 63 or 66, going back to get a master's in

22   education so that they can then apply to

23   teach in a school in a community that they're

24   living in.
                                                      310

 1         Is that an -- is there -- I don't know

 2   that it's a huge number of people, but I

 3   think that there are a lot of folks who want

 4   to give back and --

 5         INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    And I

 6   think that the one pathway you're just

 7   describing is our Transitional G pathway,

 8   which is a certification pathway that we

 9   offer for faculty of higher education

10   institutions to try to lessen the teacher

11   certification requirements for those folks so

12   that they can get into the classroom.

13   Because that's something we've -- especially

14   in STEM areas, as we have it in the science,

15   technology, engineering and math areas, and I

16   think we've expanded that as well.

17         So that's something that we currently

18   have a pathway for.   And if you want to refer

19   us the names of those individuals, we'd be

20   happy to help them work through this.

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Yeah, maybe just

22   learning a little bit more about that.

23   Because I think there is a -- you know, a

24   cohort of people who might be available in
                                                          311

 1   some of these areas that -- you know, they've

 2   left the city and they're, you know,

 3   looking --

 4            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:    And I

 5   think you're right, Chair Glick.      And we're

 6   trying to really think out of the box, like

 7   what other types of people would be -- have

 8   the education and experience, maybe in a

 9   nontraditional pathway, but still be

10   qualified to serve those students.      So that

11   is something we're thinking through

12   multiple -- you know, every way we can, into

13   which, you know, non-alternative pathways.

14            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thanks so much.

15            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.     I

16   believe that's all the questions we have.

17   Thank you for being here --

18            INTERIM COMMISSIONER TAHOE:     Thank

19   you.   Thank you.

20            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     -- with us

22   today.

23            Next we'll be hearing from New York

24   State Higher Education Services Corporation,
                                                     312

 1   Dr. Guillermo Linares, president.

 2           Whenever you're ready to begin.

 3           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Good

 4   afternoon.   Chairs Krueger, Weinstein,

 5   Stavisky, Glick, and to all my former

 6   colleagues in the Senate and Assembly, thank

 7   you for the opportunity to speak today about

 8   the Governor's 2020-2021 Executive Budget

 9   recommendations that impact the New York

10   State Higher Education Services Corporation,

11   HESC.

12           I'm Dr. Guillermo Linares, president

13   of HESC, and this morning I am joined by my

14   executive vice president, Elsa Magee.

15           HESC is responsible for administering

16   more than two dozen New York State student

17   financial aid and college access programs

18   that help to ease college costs for New York

19   State students and families, including the

20   first-in-the-nation Excelsior Scholarship and

21   the newly implemented Senator Jose Peralta

22   New York State DREAM Act.   Collectively,

23   these programs provide nearly $1.05 billion

24   in financial aid awards to support the
                                                     313

 1   college costs of more than 343,000 students

 2   attending public and private colleges inside

 3   our state.

 4           New York continues to be a leader in

 5   college access, including the nation's first

 6   free-tuition program, the Excelsior

 7   Scholarship.   This milestone program has

 8   opened the doors of higher education to

 9   thousands of working- and middle-class

10   families making $125,000 or less, while

11   helping students complete their degrees on

12   time.

13           In addition to providing free college

14   tuition to more than 20,400 students in its

15   first year and more than 25,000 students in

16   its second year, the numbers are coupled with

17   other promising outcomes, including higher

18   graduation rates, increases in the percentage

19   of students taking 15 credits, and higher

20   retention rates.   This suggests that these

21   students will incur less total costs in

22   completing their degrees and begin their

23   careers sooner.

24           To expand this transformational
                                                       314

 1   opportunity to more middle-class families,

 2   the Governor has proposed to raise the

 3   Excelsior eligibility threshold from $125,000

 4   to $150,000 for New York's families.    By

 5   increasing the threshold, more than

 6   230,000 -- or nearly 58 percent -- New York

 7   resident students will be able to attend SUNY

 8   or CUNY tuition-free.

 9          But it's not just Excelsior.    New York

10   spends over $1 billion each year on aid for

11   the financially neediest students through

12   TAP, Opportunity Programs, and the Aid for

13   Part-Time Studies program.   New York ranks

14   first in the nation in support for

15   undergraduate need-based student financial

16   aid.   And the recent implementation of the

17   Senator Jose Peralta New York State DREAM Act

18   has further opened the door to higher

19   education, allowing thousands of undocumented

20   New York State students access to TAP and all

21   other state award and scholarship programs

22   available to their citizen peers.

23          To date, nearly 75 percent of the

24   reviewed applications have been determined
                                                       315

 1   eligible to receive TAP, Excelsior, ETA and

 2   other New York State financial aid awards.

 3   Our investment in higher education continues

 4   to open doors to all New Yorkers.

 5         In closing, Governor Cuomo is a

 6   leading voice in protecting access to higher

 7   education for everyone.     Since 2012, funding

 8   for higher education has increased by nearly

 9   $1.8 billion -- 29 percent -- from $6 billion

10   to $7.8 billion in the fiscal year 2021

11   Executive Budget.   This investment includes

12   nearly $1.3 billion for strategic programs to

13   make college more affordable and encourage

14   the best and brightest students to build

15   their future in New York.

16         The Governor's recommendations for

17   higher education programs continue to pave a

18   path to an affordable and high-quality

19   college education, and HESC is pleased to

20   play a vital role in providing New York State

21   students with a gateway to a successful

22   academic and professional career.

23         Thank you, and I would be glad to

24   answer any questions you may have.

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We go to

 2   Assemblywoman Glick.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you very

 4   much.   It's good to see you, both of you.

 5           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Same here.

 6           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    How many

 7   students -- I think you said that there are

 8   45,000 students who have gotten into

 9   Excelsior.   In your testimony, in addition to

10   providing tuition to more than 20,000

11   students in the first year and more than

12   25 {sic} students in its second year -- did

13   that not refer to Excelsior?

14           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    The second

15   year is 25,000 students.

16           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Right.   The

17   first year was 20, and then it was 25.       So is

18   that --

19           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Those are the

20   first two years.   We're in the third year.

21           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Right.   Out of

22   those 45,000, how many students fell out of

23   the program?

24           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    We don't --
                                                         317

 1   we don't have that information at this point.

 2            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    It's a cumulative

 3   25,000 are currently receiving.     Between

 4   Year 1 and Year 2, some have graduated who

 5   received awards in Year 1.      And then we have

 6   new --

 7            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Could you just

 8   pull that a little bit closer?     Elsa, you're

 9   such a soft-spoken person.

10            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    Sorry.

11            So the net number is 25,000 for the

12   current year, and growing for 2019-2020.

13            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Do we know how

14   many students each year fall out of TAP

15   eligibility because they haven't maintained

16   their prescribed program of study?

17            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    We can get you

18   that data.    I think what we find more with

19   TAP is that there are fewer students who are

20   failing to meet the standards for academic

21   progress than there are who just don't come

22   back for another term.

23            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Okay.    Well, it

24   would be helpful to know how that's going.
                                                      318

 1         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     Yeah, we can --

 2         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     And also I am

 3   concerned about students who go into a

 4   scholarship program, they and their families

 5   assume that they will be without a debt on

 6   that portion.    Obviously if they go to a

 7   school out of town, they're going to have a

 8   room and board cost.   But they assume that

 9   their tuition is covered.   And then they fall

10   out of the program for any number of reasons,

11   and it turns into a loan.   Which, you know,

12   sort of after the fact is a shock.    It's

13   like, you know, buying a car that was a gift

14   from a relative who then says, You know what,

15   you changed the oil, now you've got to pay

16   for the car.

17         That's sort of like a little bit of a

18   problem.   It may be only for a very small

19   percentage, but it is of concern to those

20   individuals.    And we've had that happen with

21   students in the STEM scholarship who are

22   unable to find work.

23         So what are the forbearances that are

24   allowed -- and what are the hardships -- in
                                                     319

 1   Excelsior, in TAP, and in the STEM program?

 2         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    I'd say, first,

 3   if there's a student who you know of who has

 4   had their award converted to a loan because

 5   they weren't able to find a job, they should

 6   contact us, because we do have -- there are

 7   qualifications under which they would not

 8   have to repay the loan.

 9         So we do have provisions in the law

10   for students who really cannot find a job in

11   New York State, and other hardships that --

12   where it would not convert to a loan.

13         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Are --

14         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   And what I --

15   what I would add to that is that one thing

16   that we -- in communicating with both SUNY

17   and CUNY, for Excelsior students, be mindful

18   of the 30 credits that they have to carry.

19   There's been sensitivity to really lend, in

20   the college where they attend, extra guidance

21   and support and to be able to guide them to

22   the possible way so that they don't lose the

23   scholarship.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Well, you know,
                                                      320

 1   stuff happens in life.   And so a parent could

 2   die, which disrupts -- you know, in some ways

 3   college is the least of their problems,

 4   except they've gone for two years and then

 5   their parent dies, and then there's this

 6   upheaval.   They may be sick themselves.   A

 7   friend of mine has -- not going to a school

 8   in this state, but the kid had to withdraw

 9   because of a health problem.

10         So these things happen in real life.

11   And I'm wondering how flexible we have -- you

12   know, and whether there's on your website, if

13   somebody has been looking and saying, hey,

14   this looks like the right thing for me, and

15   then it turns out it didn't work out, is

16   there anything there that lets them know you

17   don't have to know Assemblymember So-and-so

18   or Senator So-and-so, that you can actually

19   reach out to HESC for an amelioration of

20   this -- what is a crisis?

21         If somebody -- and I -- we did a bill

22   specifically because of some problems people

23   had upstate on the STEM scholarship.    It was

24   very upsetting, and the reaction from
                                                      321

 1   Executive -- members of the Executive who I

 2   spoke with about the veto around the STEM

 3   scholarship, doing something to change some

 4   of the postgraduate requirements, was, you

 5   know, not overly encouraging.

 6         So how do people know that if they've

 7   had a crisis they can reach out to you?   Is

 8   there something specific like "in the event

 9   of a problem, call us"?

10         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    Well, what we do

11   each year for anyone who's receiving a

12   scholarship that has a post-graduate service

13   requirement, we reach out to the students

14   every year to see if they're still in the

15   right program, et cetera.   But if they're not

16   when they respond back to us, that's the time

17   that we really try to identify the reason for

18   that and if they're really eligible for one

19   of these hardship exemptions or not.

20         So we do have annual contact with

21   these students to make sure they did attend

22   for the year in the program, met those

23   requirements, and if they're going to

24   continue further or if there's a reason why
                                                      322

 1   they were not able to remain in the program.

 2         If it is medical hardship for a

 3   student or death of a parent, disability of a

 4   parent, disability of the student, those are

 5   all already exemptions that we take into

 6   account.

 7         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    And we look

 8   at it on a case-by-case basis.   Obviously we

 9   maintain very close relationship and

10   communication with colleges where the

11   students attend.   And, you know, extenuating

12   circumstances may be health-related, they may

13   be something unexpected but grave that may

14   have impacted the student and their family.

15   So it's on a case by-case basis.

16         But there are triggers.    Because if

17   you are receiving an Excelsior scholarship,

18   obviously you don't want to lose it.    If

19   something comes underway, then you want to

20   negotiate with your college and also with us.

21   And we are very sensitive to when those

22   circumstances come.   But again, it's a

23   case-by-case situation.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    But there are --
                                                     323

 1   perhaps you can get us some information if in

 2   fact there have been scholarships that have

 3   turned into loans.   I'm not sure how much of

 4   an issue it is.

 5         But they contacted their

 6   Assemblymember, who then contacted me.    So

 7   clearly somehow they didn't know that there

 8   was help through you all.   So that's -- you

 9   know, we want to just make certain that when

10   students think that we've made a pact with

11   them and they've, you know, signed on and

12   then they have a problem, they -- I just want

13   to be sure they know.   And, you know, we'll

14   check the website.   Maybe there's something

15   there that should be added into this -- not

16   where you have to hunt for it, like now

17   you're in deep trouble, now you can call us.

18   But something a little bit more closer up to

19   where they're signing up for this but should

20   there be a crisis, you can contact us.    I

21   mean, that I think would be helpful.

22         Thanks very much.

23         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

24         Senator Toby Stavisky.
                                                       324

 1         SENATOR STAVISKY:     Thank you.

 2         Good to see you again, Dr. Linares,

 3   Ms. Magee.

 4         Eleven days ago I sent a letter to

 5   HESC, dated -- and it was emailed and I think

 6   regular mail.   And it said, and I'll just

 7   read the first paragraph:     "In anticipation

 8   of the February 4, 2020 budget hearing, I

 9   want to provide you with the opportunity to

10   gather information because I will be asking

11   questions relevant to HESC.    I would like to

12   avoid 'I'll get back to you' responses.    If

13   it's easier, substitute the calendar year

14   instead of the academic or fiscal year."

15         I never got any of those answers.      So

16   I don't want to read you the questions that I

17   gave you ahead of time.   I'm looking at your

18   testimony, and I don't see -- you know, I see

19   sort of a sketchy response.

20         We want to know about the DREAM Act,

21   Enhanced TAP, Excelsior, and how it's

22   working -- the number of students that are

23   applying, the number that are rejected --

24   broken down by program -- the number that are
                                                       325

 1   rejected and the reason that they're

 2   rejected.    And all of these questions I think

 3   should be answered in anticipation of budget

 4   negotiations.

 5         I have no further questions.

 6         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Madam Chair,

 7   I am in receipt of your letter, or of the

 8   questions that you posed.   We want to be able

 9   to provide to you all the specific numbers

10   that go with each one of the questions that

11   you posed.   I am prepared to give you a

12   general sense of some of the questions that

13   you posed now.   And immediately follow up

14   with you, responding with specific numbers

15   that we are looking into.

16         As you understand, the DREAM Act is

17   just being rolled out now, so the numbers are

18   fluid, but we are preparing to respond with

19   your request.

20         With regards to Excelsior, we do have

21   the numbers for the first and second year in

22   general terms.   We do have a clear sense now

23   of where the third year will take us, which

24   we fully anticipate we are now at 28 -- over
                                                      326

 1   28,000 students will benefit from Excelsior.

 2   By the time this fiscal year -- the school

 3   year ends, we fully anticipate about 30,000

 4   students will be receiving the Excelsior

 5   Scholarship.

 6         I can tell you that the projected

 7   funding for Excelsior is around 120 million

 8   to cover the program.   That is the projection

 9   that we have.

10         I can share with you that the specific

11   question that you asked regarding the DREAM

12   Act -- first let me preamble, before I give

13   you the number, to share that we had a very

14   successful rollout for the DREAM Act.   We

15   were aggressive in approaching the vast

16   network of organizations that provide

17   services to immigrant communities and engage

18   them, understanding how important it was to

19   address the fear factor that so many Dreamers

20   and immigrant communities, with aggressive

21   federal intervention, have.

22         And we engaged those institutional --

23   along with our partners, CUNY, SUNY, and

24   other universities, in helping prepare a
                                                      327

 1   simplified application for the Dreamers.

 2   Bear in mind that many of them are not

 3   experienced filling out financial aid

 4   applications, so we wanted to simplify it.

 5           The other thing we did was to change

 6   the platform to address the issue of fear but

 7   also safety, and also confidentiality with

 8   them.   We did away with Social Security

 9   numbers, which is the system we have to

10   provide financial aid across the state, and

11   we now use ID numbers for students.   That was

12   quite an undertaking.    And in an eight-week

13   time frame we launched the application, also

14   crafted guidance, step by step, for the

15   students to be able to successfully apply.

16   And over 5,000 Dreamers applied for the

17   scholarship.

18           Of those that we have reviewed thus

19   far, 75 percent are eligible to receive

20   financial assistance, primarily through TAP,

21   but also a number of them were able to apply

22   for Excelsior and ETA.   The vast majority,

23   though, TAP.

24           But we are now in the middle of
                                                      328

 1   reviewing all of those applications.     Given

 2   how short a time frame we had, I have to say

 3   the rollout has been successful, and we have

 4   worked very closely, again, with many

 5   partners to make sure that any issue -- we

 6   have no issue whatsoever in terms of the

 7   rollout or the program.   And whenever we had

 8   any issue or concern, they were addressed as

 9   we needed.

10         SENATOR STAVISKY:   That's why I sent

11   the letter.

12         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Yeah.

13   Regarding the other question that you posed,

14   which I'd like to respond to now, in terms of

15   the time frame for applying for Excelsior,

16   once we do the residency and the income

17   questions, we are able to have a 48-hour

18   turnaround for the majority of those that

19   apply, particularly if they're freshmen.

20         If they have been attending school

21   previously, we then have to rely on the

22   college that they attended to provide that

23   information.

24         And for the DREAM Act, once a Dreamer
                                                        329

 1   submits an application and fulfills all the

 2   requirements, we have a response, a

 3   turnaround of 10 days to be able to get back

 4   to them.

 5            SENATOR STAVISKY:   You will provide

 6   the information.

 7            Let me ask a question.    I understand

 8   that the appropriation on the DREAM Act, as

 9   an example, is about 27 million, something

10   like that.    What happens if the money is not

11   expended in that particular budget year?

12   What happens to the unused money that has

13   been appropriated?

14            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Well, the

15   application for the DREAM Act is year-round.

16   So we've seen over 5,000 have applied, but

17   this is an ongoing process.

18            SENATOR STAVISKY:   That's not my

19   question.    My question is what happens if you

20   do not allocate all of the $27 million?

21            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:   Those are General

22   Fund dollars.

23            SENATOR STAVISKY:   What happens to the

24   money?    Does it go back to the General Fund,
                                                         330

 1   does it go into your -- is it reappropriated?

 2   What happens to it?

 3         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     The funds will

 4   stay in the General Fund if they're not

 5   utilized --

 6         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:      Right, in the

 7   General Fund.

 8         (Overtalk.)

 9         SENATOR STAVISKY:    They'll stay in

10   HESC --

11         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     Yeah, they're

12   there and that's where they would remain.

13         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Okay.

14         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     But if there are

15   awards that are owed in the future for this

16   current year, there are reappropriations.      So

17   the funds -- the student would still get the

18   payment, correct.

19         SENATOR STAVISKY:    It doesn't go back

20   to the General Fund.

21         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     It -- it's in the

22   General Fund.    It's never come to us, it's

23   paid out of the General Fund in all

24   instances.    So it would sit there.
                                                          331

 1            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Through the

 2   colleges where the Dreamers attend.

 3            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 4            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 5            Assembly.

 6            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Mr. Epstein.

 7            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Thank you for

 8   being here and taking the time to talk to us

 9   about these really important issues.

10            Just, I know, with Senator Stavisky's

11   issues, how many people applied for the DREAM

12   Act?

13            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   How many

14   people applied?

15            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Yeah.

16            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   This year

17   for --

18            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   This year.

19            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    -- Excelsior

20   or DREAM?

21            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   DREAM.

22            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   DREAM.     Over

23   5,000 initiated the application.

24            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Right.    And how
                                                        332

 1   many people applied for --

 2         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:      Seventy-five

 3   percent of those completed.

 4         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     When you say

 5   "completed," they were awarded?    When you say

 6   "completed," what do you mean?

 7         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:     There are

 8   5,000 completed applications.

 9         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     And those 5,000

10   were awarded TAP?

11         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:     Mostly TAP

12   has been awarded for those that have been

13   processed.    And we're currently in the

14   process of --

15         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     Of those 5,000,

16   how many were rejected?

17         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:      So 5,000 have

18   completed applications.    Some are pending

19   review.     Of the ones that have been reviewed,

20   75 percent -- it's really 73 percent -- of

21   the reviewed applications have been deemed

22   eligible.

23         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     And how many

24   have been reviewed?
                                                       333

 1         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:      We've had --

 2   about 4,000 of the 5,000 have been reviewed.

 3   So we have about 2100, 2200 students who have

 4   already been deemed eligible for --

 5         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     So out of 5,000,

 6   2100 or 2200 have been deemed eligible.

 7         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:      Yeah.   And some

 8   of those -- we have about a thousand that

 9   really have not been reviewed yet.      So they

10   could also be eligible.     And students are

11   continuing to apply as well.

12         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     Thank you.

13         How many people have applied for

14   Excelsior?

15         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:      About 52 --

16   this year?

17         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     This year.

18         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:      About 52 --

19   over 52,000 have applied.    We have identified

20   eligible about 28 -- over 28,000.

21         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     Thank you.

22         Have you thought about -- we've heard

23   a lot around TAP being at an insufficient

24   level at this point, with tuition over
                                                       334

 1   $7,000.    Would you advocate increasing the

 2   TAP award for students?

 3           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Well, as you

 4   know, TAP is the bulk of the funding that we

 5   provide across the state, nearly a billion

 6   dollars.   And of course I understand that

 7   there are discussions taking place about how

 8   best to use or change the TAP --

 9           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Do you believe

10   TAP should go up for students?

11           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   The need, for

12   students, is always there.     We -- we have

13   specific populations that could benefit from

14   that.   But the answer is yes, but it's a

15   question that the Legislature and the

16   Governor need to address.

17           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Thank you.

18           And I'm wondering, the TAP dollars,

19   what percentage of it goes to for-profit

20   schools, nonprofit schools, versus public

21   schools?

22           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Well, we can

23   provide you with a breakdown of --

24           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   That would be
                                                         335

 1   great.

 2            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    -- of all of

 3   that breakdown.    You know, across a billion

 4   dollars is significant in all three sectors,

 5   the for-profit, nonprofit and also --

 6            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   And do you

 7   maintain default rates for all three sectors

 8   separately?

 9            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   I'm sorry?

10            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Do you maintain

11   default rates for all three sectors

12   separately?

13            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    Not by sector.

14   We have, by colleges, default -- cohort

15   default rates by college.

16            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   I'm sorry, I

17   couldn't hear that.

18            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    We have cohort

19   default rates by college but not by sector.

20            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Not by sector,

21   but you do by college.   And how far out do

22   you do?    Do you do three years or do you do

23   five and 10 years?

24            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    It's a three-year
                                                        336

 1   look.

 2            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Do you keep

 3   information five and 10 years out as well?

 4            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    No, the

 5   national -- we use the national formula, and

 6   it's always a --

 7            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   But if they're

 8   not paying back, you don't -- you don't have

 9   any data that says what happens after three

10   years?    There's nothing that you maintain?

11            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    We don't.

12            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   And is there a

13   reason you don't, just to see post-three

14   years how people are doing with their loan

15   repayment?

16            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    We don't -- we

17   don't touch all of the students who have

18   student loans.    We only have information on

19   students who either got loans with us, now

20   going back more than 10 years ago, or --

21            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   So why don't you

22   just maintain that record five, 10 years out

23   so we know past the three years how people

24   are doing just with your loans?     It would be
                                                       337

 1   great to have that information as well.

 2            Yeah, I'd appreciate, if you have that

 3   information, it would be great for you to

 4   gather it.

 5            And I know my time is up, so thank you

 6   both.

 7            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:   Okay, thank you.

 8            Senator Jim Seward.

 9            SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you, Madam

10   Chair.

11            And Dr. Linares, Ms. Magee, thank you

12   for being here.

13            In terms of the rollout of the DREAM

14   Act program, am I correct in saying that the

15   undocumented students do not have to fill out

16   the FAFSA forms?

17            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:   That's correct.

18            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   That's

19   correct.

20            SENATOR SEWARD:   Now, my question is,

21   how is income eligibility being verified for

22   students who receive a -- you know, pursuant

23   to the DREAM Act?    Is there an income

24   eligibility check?
                                                       338

 1         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Yeah.   They

 2   self-report and fill out an affidavit

 3   specifying, if they have income, what that

 4   income is.   And that's a provision that we

 5   provide within the application process.     And

 6   so it's a self-reporting because there's no

 7   way of knowing whether they generate income

 8   or not.   But we use that to determine

 9   eligibility.

10         SENATOR SEWARD:   So that's part of the

11   application process, is what you're saying?

12         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Yes.    Yes.

13         SENATOR SEWARD:   Can you share with us

14   how many individuals have applied for

15   financial aid because they qualify under the

16   DREAM Act?   How many students have applied

17   for financial aid because they qualify?

18         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    The vast

19   majority -- we anticipate, because we don't

20   have the final numbers, because we are in the

21   process of reviewing all of the applications.

22         But we -- of those who complete all

23   the requirements that they have, and after we

24   have done the review of those, we find about
                                                         339

 1   75 percent of those that we complete the

 2   review are found eligible for financial aid.

 3           SENATOR SEWARD:   Thank you.     No

 4   further questions.

 5           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 6           Assembly.

 7           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Assemblymember

 8   Pichardo.

 9           ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:     Good afternoon,

10   EVP Magee and Dr. Linares {in Spanish}.

11           So I just want to make sure, just out

12   of curiosity, is there a sense or a way where

13   we can -- this committee in our respective

14   houses can receive the exact number of

15   applications, the failure rate in terms of

16   applications for both Excelsior and for the

17   Jose Peralta DREAM Act, by any chance?

18           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Sure.

19           ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Okay.   We'd

20   love to see those numbers.      Because again, I

21   know that -- first of all, sir, appreciate

22   your service, and you and I both served with

23   Jose.   And, you know, if he wasn't around, if

24   he wasn't here with us, he would be here
                                                      340

 1   asking these same questions of us.   So, you

 2   know, it's important that we make sure that

 3   this program is successful and that, if there

 4   is a slack of funding or a lack of funding,

 5   that we are able to make up the shortfall.

 6         So in terms of just asking, what else

 7   do we need to make sure that every single

 8   eligible student that is eligible for not

 9   only Excelsior but for DREAM Act, that they

10   get the word out?   How else can we be helpful

11   in that endeavor?

12         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    That's a very

13   good question.   Because, you know, as the

14   original sponsor when I was in your chair of

15   the DREAM Act in 2011, this program is close

16   to my heart.

17         So my biggest fear, as we had it

18   finally approved, thanks to you, is that the

19   aggressiveness with which Washington is

20   approaching particularly our state brings to

21   higher levels the level of fear in many

22   immigrant families and Dreamers.   So that's

23   why we were so aggressive in engaging trusted

24   institutions across the state, knowing that a
                                                      341

 1   large portion of undocumented families and

 2   students find themselves in the five boroughs

 3   and also Long Island, Westchester, but

 4   they're also present in other parts of the

 5   state.    And engaging in a proactive way with

 6   those diverse institutions working with

 7   immigrant families was key and instrumental

 8   in approaching the number that we have

 9   received so far.

10            We have to continue to spread the

11   word.    And this is now a renewed effort that

12   we're undertaking using all media that is

13   accessible, TV, but by and large the ethnic

14   media and also the community-based

15   organizations across the state.    Because the

16   only way to address the fear factor is really

17   to have the word of mouth but also trusted

18   individuals and institutions.

19            And so having Dreamers know that when

20   they provide information to us, it comes to

21   us and it is highly confidential by law,

22   federal and state, and that that information

23   goes nowhere.    The only connections we've

24   made as an agency is to the institution where
                                                         342

 1   they're attending to get a degree, for the

 2   purposes of providing the financial aid.      And

 3   that alone goes a long way in them not being

 4   hesitant and concerned about applying when

 5   they're undocumented under these

 6   circumstances.

 7          So we are engaged in a campaign and

 8   using all those that can help us make sure

 9   that every Dreamer that's eligible to attend

10   one of our universities has that opportunity

11   without fear.

12          ASSEMBLYMAN PICHARDO:    Well, thank

13   you.   And again, I want to reiterate my point

14   to you, Dr. Linares, that we would love to --

15   if we can share those numbers with the

16   committee.   Just obviously the raw totals,

17   not confidential information, just to see how

18   we can continue to support Dream specifically

19   and making sure that it's a successful

20   program.

21          And thank you for your time and your

22   service.

23          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

24          To the Senate, Robert Jackson.
                                                         343

 1            SENATOR JACKSON:    Thank you, Madam

 2   Chair.

 3            Dr. Guillermo Linares, let me thank

 4   you for your leadership.     Obviously we -- you

 5   and I go back a long way.      Community school

 6   boards, fighting for the children in District

 7   6.   I remember loud and clear when parent

 8   voters -- parents were allowed to vote even

 9   if they were noncitizens.      And we, along with

10   other community leaders, registered 10,000

11   parent voters to vote in school board

12   elections.    And so --

13            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    In three

14   months.

15            SENATOR JACKSON:    Three months.     So

16   you've been a fighter, and I think you're in

17   a great position to help students to access

18   higher education.

19            I think you may have been here earlier

20   when I asked about looking at the budget as

21   far as the decrease in the Higher Education

22   Corporation's funding.      Have you -- your

23   budget has been decreased, am I

24   understanding, yes or no?
                                                       344

 1         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:     I'm not aware

 2   that that's the case.   In fact, what my

 3   understanding is that is -- there is an

 4   increase in terms of the funding for the

 5   programs that we administer.   And in terms of

 6   our operation as an agency, we're whole.

 7         SENATOR JACKSON:    You're whole?

 8         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:     Yes.

 9         SENATOR JACKSON:    Okay.   Because I

10   think it's so important that students have

11   the opportunity to go into higher education.

12   Obviously they indicate this is the

13   Empire State.   Someone said to me, we need

14   this to be the progressive state,

15   that Governor Cuomo says he's progressive, so

16   let's call this a progressive state and make

17   sure that our children receive a progressive

18   education and not the opportunity for a

19   sound, basic education which is not being

20   funded -- which has been challenged in the

21   courts and we won.   So obviously that's

22   important for me, and you know that.

23         But with respect to your subject

24   area -- and I'm sorry I walked in late, I was
                                                        345

 1   in conference dealing with the presentation

 2   on education.    Can you tell me what effect,

 3   if any -- to the best of your knowledge, what

 4   effect does it have on children, students

 5   going into higher education if in fact they

 6   do not receive a good education?    What effect

 7   does that have on them entering college and

 8   life beyond?

 9           HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Well, the

10   Governor usually says that a college degree

11   today is what 50 years ago a high school

12   diploma was.    And never in the history of our

13   country has there been such an urgent need in

14   getting a two- or a four-year degree and

15   beyond for the workforce demands that we

16   have.   And earlier we had both CUNY and SUNY

17   chancellors speaking to that.

18           Sixty-five percent of the jobs that

19   are most promising in terms of income when

20   you hit the workforce require -- 65 percent

21   require a college degree.   And so we cannot

22   afford, when we have a student enter the

23   doors, to not to get to the finish line.      So

24   that's why one of the things that we're doing
                                                        346

 1   now in a very aggressive way is to engage

 2   K-12 -- but I say to K to 3rd purposely

 3   because it is not engaging only the guidance

 4   counselors in the high school level, but if

 5   by fifth or sixth grade there has not been

 6   engagement with our young people about

 7   planning and expecting to attend college,

 8   it's too late.    So we need to really engage

 9   K-12, but also engage other partners at the

10   higher education level.

11            SENATOR JACKSON:   Sure.   So with

12   respect to your agency, what is the primary

13   role of your agency as far as to help

14   students get into college?

15            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    I am -- I am

16   working -- when I arrived to my agency three

17   years ago, I found that it did a very good

18   job processing scholarships and grants and so

19   forth.    I have now engaged in trying to make

20   the agency a service-oriented agency for

21   students and families, and by extension

22   communities, leveraging as much communication

23   as possible, a strategy in communication

24   leveraging the new technology that we have.
                                                           347

 1            We're having soon a director of

 2   communication coming on board, because the

 3   27 programs that we have to provide financial

 4   aid and provide assistance to students -- the

 5   information of those programs needs to be in

 6   the hands of students and families.     And they

 7   need to be aware of what exists for them,

 8   what's available to them, in order for us to

 9   be fully successful.

10            So it's shifting the agency to be

11   service-oriented to students and families,

12   working closely with very trusted and strong

13   partners that we have -- CUNY, SUNY, the

14   private colleges --

15            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Guillermo, I'm

16   going to cut you off so that the Assembly can

17   ask you more questions.

18            SENATOR JACKSON:    Thank you, Madam

19   Chair.    Thank you, Dr. Linares.

20            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.    Thank

21   you.

22            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Assemblymember

23   Ra.

24            ASSEMBLYMAN RA:    Good afternoon,
                                                       348

 1   Dr. Linares.    Good to see you.

 2            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Good to see

 3   you.

 4            ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   I just have a quick

 5   question, and if you don't have this

 6   information, perhaps you can get it to us.

 7   But last year there was a new kind of small

 8   scholarship that was put into the budget, the

 9   Child Welfare Worker Incentive Scholarship

10   and the Child Welfare Worker Loan Forgiveness

11   Program, which was designed as, you know, an

12   incentive to an industry that's having a lot

13   of trouble with recruitment and retention of

14   staff.

15            And if you'd be able to get us some

16   information just in terms of -- you know,

17   they're looking to expand that; I think

18   there's a need there.      But just in terms of

19   how many people have participated in these

20   programs, how many have applied for these

21   programs, just to get a real sense of what

22   the demand is for those programs.

23            HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Be glad to

24   send you that information.
                                                       349

 1            ASSEMBLYMAN RA:   Okay, thank you.

 2            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 3            Continuing with the Assembly.

 4            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Assemblymember

 5   Simon.

 6            ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   Thank you.

 7            Good afternoon.   I have a couple of

 8   questions that really go to TAP and our use

 9   of TAP.    Obviously there's the TAP gap that

10   we've been talking about, but I'm also

11   concerned about part-time TAP and --

12   part-time TAP and how our policies require

13   students to be a full-time student for a year

14   before they can access part-time TAP, instead

15   of the other way around.

16            Because we know so many students start

17   school -- and often in community colleges it

18   is the entryway for 75 percent of students

19   with disabilities, is to begin their college

20   careers, postsecondary careers in a community

21   college, and they are pretty much foreclosed

22   from taking advantage of TAP if they are

23   starting out part-time.

24            Can you give me some sense of the
                                                        350

 1   decision-making behind that and what you're

 2   doing to look at that issue?

 3          HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:    Well, I'm

 4   going to ask Elsa to respond to this specific

 5   question, but we also have the part-time

 6   scholarship that we just initiated, right,

 7   which complements those students who need

 8   financial aid to -- because they attend

 9   part-time.

10          HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     But specific to

11   students with disabilities, they do not need

12   to meet the full-time requirement to receive

13   TAP.   So for any student who has a disability

14   under the Americans with Disabilities Act,

15   they -- it doesn't matter whether they start

16   off part-time or they can enroll for 12

17   credits, they are always eligible for TAP.

18   And we'll just prorate so that they continue

19   to receive the award while they're in

20   attendance at school.

21          ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:     And I know there

22   had been an issue where they would be

23   foreclosed after four years if they needed

24   additional years, and that has been fixed.
                                                     351

 1         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    That would be

 2   prorated so they'd get it for as many years

 3   as they --

 4         HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   That's the

 5   way it works for Excelsior also.

 6         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   But outside of

 7   students with disabilities, there are still

 8   plenty of students who start off in community

 9   colleges who can't access TAP unless they go

10   full-time for a year.

11         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:    But as

12   Dr. Linares said, for students we do have the

13   part-time scholarship program for students

14   attending a SUNY or CUNY college, where they

15   can continue to take anywheres from three to

16   11 credits, and they can receive $3,000 under

17   that program.

18         And then there's also the Aid for

19   Part-Time Studies Program, where there's

20   $14 million available, and that's

21   administered by the college directly as well,

22   for part-time students.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:   And how do

24   students find out about this?   How do
                                                       352

 1   students find out about this?

 2         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     The colleges --

 3         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    The availability

 4   of these programs, how are they communicated

 5   to students?   Because -- and obviously if

 6   they're beginning -- you know, how is that

 7   information getting down to the high schools,

 8   for example, to help parents to know that

 9   this is a resource available to their

10   children?

11         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     I think,

12   interestingly, we don't typically market

13   part-time programs to high school guidance

14   counselors.    But we can begin doing that,

15   certainly.

16         The schools -- we work directly with

17   financial aid officers, and they tend to

18   be -- because the students are there in their

19   offices.    They know about our programs, and

20   they're usually the ones -- they administer

21   the Aid for Part-Time Study Program right on

22   their campuses.    So they're usually the ones,

23   when they see that a student is part-time and

24   meets the eligibility requirements, they make
                                                       353

 1   the students aware of those requirements.

 2         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    And how many

 3   students have accessed that part-time

 4   scholarship program?

 5         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     Part-time

 6   scholarship?   I'd have to get you the actual

 7   numbers.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN SIMON:    Thank you.    I'd

 9   be interested in learning more about that.

10         Thank you.

11         HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:     Sure.

12         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

13         Assembly continues.

14         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Assemblymember

15   Fahy to close.

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:     Thank you.

17         Thank you, Dr. Linares, it's good to

18   see you here, former colleague.   And thank

19   you for all your service here and at HESC.

20         I want to share -- just briefly share

21   the concerns about the expansion of TAP and

22   the serious and growing need for TAP.      So I

23   just -- I'm not going to reiterate some of

24   the comments, but even the part-time TAP I
                                                      354

 1   know is something very much in demand.     So

 2   thank you for all you can do to try to

 3   address that, as well as the demand across

 4   the board for the financial aid.

 5         I have a smaller question, and happy

 6   to follow up with you on it.   The master's

 7   and teachers program, it's a bill that I've

 8   had the last few years to try to expand that.

 9   And if I understand correctly, it's -- the

10   number of scholarships awarded for that

11   master's and teachers program has kind of

12   held steady, I think it's allocated at $5

13   million.   It hasn't broken a million dollars.

14   And yet, as you know, we have a very serious

15   teacher shortage, and I think it could be

16   quite instrumental in helping teachers.

17         We've also added that not just public

18   universities could access that, but private

19   nonprofits could as well.   Do you happen to

20   know where -- it seems to be consistently

21   around that 60 range.   Do you know where --

22   is it just that certain universities are

23   marketing it better, or is there something

24   that we can do to increase those numbers,
                                                     355

 1   given that we haven't even broken the million

 2   dollars, yet we know there's a need for those

 3   master's degrees?

 4            HESC EXEC VP MAGEE:   We have not

 5   really focused so far.   But as Dr. Linares

 6   said, we are getting a new communications

 7   director in, and this is one of the programs

 8   where we really want to work with SUNY and

 9   CUNY at their colleges that are educating our

10   teachers, to make sure that the students do

11   know about it, because we do know that we can

12   award 500 each year, and we're not at that

13   mark yet.

14            ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:   Yes, that's

15   right, up to 500, and I think it's allocated

16   at 5 million, yet we're in and around the 60

17   range.

18            Again, I have the bill to try to

19   expand that to make sure that we are using

20   those monies, given the critical shortages.

21   I welcome the opportunity to follow up with

22   you to see which schools are using it, and

23   maybe it's somewhat of a marketing issue, as

24   well as I would contend an expansion of that
                                                         356

 1   program.

 2          HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Yeah.     Part

 3   of what we want to do is really raise

 4   awareness of all of the programs that we

 5   have, whether it is Get Off Your Feet or this

 6   particular program, just to raise awareness

 7   about them that they are there to take

 8   advantage of, and this is a big priority.

 9          ASSEMBLYWOMAN FAHY:    Thank you.    Thank

10   you.   Thank you, Chair.

11          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.    Thank

12   you very much for your testimony here today.

13          HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Thank you.

14          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    You are now free.

15          (Laughter.)

16          HESC PRESIDENT LINARES:   Thank you.

17          (Discussion off the record.)

18          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Next up,

19   Andrew Pallotta, NYSUT president, along with

20   Frederick Kowal, president of United

21   University Professions, and Barbara Bowen,

22   president of Professional Staff Congress.

23   And there might be a fourth -- Alithia Rolon,

24   NYSUT legislative director.
                                                        357

 1            Good afternoon.

 2            MR. PALLOTTA:   Good afternoon,

 3   Chairperson Krueger, Chairperson Stavisky,

 4   Chairperson Glick.

 5            I first commend you for your stamina.

 6   This is amazing, and we've heard some great

 7   testimony today.

 8            I am Andy Pallotta, president of

 9   New York State United Teachers.    We represent

10   600,000-plus members around the state

11   involved in education and healthcare.      Thank

12   you for the opportunity to testify before you

13   today.    I am joined by Fred Kowal, UUP

14   president, and also Barbara Bowen, president

15   of the PSC.    They will testify today, and I

16   will make sure that I do not repeat too many

17   things that we've heard for the last day.

18            So public higher education, as we all

19   know, provides a pathway out of poverty and

20   into the middle class for so many families

21   throughout New York State.     We've heard how

22   many folks have gone through the system, and

23   I would start off by saying I went to

24   Kingsborough Community College and then
                                                     358

 1   Brooklyn College for my master's in

 2   education.

 3         When the state doesn't invest in

 4   public education, it's harmful to all of our

 5   students and our communities.   Worse still,

 6   these effects most strongly impact low-income

 7   communities, and thus this impact is borne by

 8   those who can least afford to shoulder it.

 9   This year the Executive Budget once again

10   holds SUNY and CUNY's instructional core

11   budgets flat from last year.    The negative

12   impact of all this is too familiar to us and

13   is felt by our students and the educators in

14   the field.

15         When we refer to investment, we are

16   asking the state to cover all mandatory

17   costs, which include collective bargaining

18   increases, energy and other inflationary

19   costs, as well as tuition credit waivers.

20   Without state funding to cover these rising

21   costs, SUNY and CUNY are forced to absorb

22   them, which often necessitates reductions in

23   academic programs and student supports.    We

24   would like to thank you for continuing to
                                                       359

 1   support the legislation that requires the

 2   state to reimburse all mandatory costs.

 3            At this time I'll just discuss quickly

 4   about community colleges, and I thank you for

 5   your support for these campuses around the

 6   state.    As you well know, community colleges

 7   educate and prepare students for the

 8   workforce and provide the necessary

 9   foundation for students moving on to

10   four-year campuses and universities or into

11   the workforce.    They often collaborate with

12   regional businesses and employers to develop

13   and provide training to access specific local

14   workforce needs.

15            The Executive Budget proposes flat

16   funding per FTE for community colleges, which

17   will likely force many campuses to raise

18   tuition and/or eliminate programs and student

19   services.

20            We believe now is the time to provide

21   baseline funding to financially stabilize our

22   campuses.    Accordingly, we are asking for a

23   base aid increase of $250 per FTE and for

24   SUNY community colleges.   In addition to the
                                                      360

 1   $250 FTE, we are also continuing to advocate

 2   for the hybrid FTE funding methodology for

 3   SUNY community colleges that would provide

 4   funding based on a model that will insulate

 5   them from enrollment fluctuations.    This

 6   methodology will provide our SUNY community

 7   colleges with some level of security and

 8   allow them to strategically plan for the

 9   future, as well as provide them with

10   additional support.

11          And before I wrap up, I wanted to talk

12   to you about the need to eliminate the TAP

13   gap.   We've heard a lot about this today, and

14   I'm glad that everyone -- everyone -- seems

15   to be talking about the TAP gap today, so

16   this is excellent.    And this has resulted in

17   serious educational inequality issues within

18   SUNY and CUNY.   The nature of the tuition

19   credit is such that schools that serve poorer

20   communities where students are more likely to

21   receive the maximum TAP award are forced to

22   bear the heaviest hits to their operating

23   budgets.

24          We appreciate the state's desire to
                                                      361

 1   increase student access to public higher

 2   education, and we must focus on providing the

 3   funding to preserve and enhance the quality

 4   of the education offered by CUNY and SUNY.

 5   We understand that the table target typically

 6   allotted to higher education is limited and

 7   does not allow for new investments after

 8   funding is restored to programs such as

 9   student Opportunity Programs.

10         Also, NYSUT is aggressively pursuing a

11   campaign to secure stable revenue streams to

12   fund the futures of our students.   It is time

13   to close the ever-widening gap between the

14   haves and the have-nots.   It is time to hold

15   billionaires and ultra-millionaires

16   accountable and demand that they pay their

17   fair share in taxes.   Funding generated from

18   these revenue streams could be used to make

19   much-needed improvements and investments in

20   education and help reverse the years of flat

21   funding and ensure that we are providing the

22   students with a first-rate education.

23         We have much polling to support the

24   public support for taxation, and I will now
                                                       362

 1   turn it over to Dr. Fred Kowal.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Very well-timed.

 3         MR. PALLOTTA:   That was -- I practiced

 4   all day.

 5         (Laughter.)

 6         DR. KOWAL:    Thank you, Chairperson

 7   Krueger, Chairperson Weinstein, Chairperson

 8   Stavisky, Chairperson Glick, members of the

 9   Senate Finance Committee, Assembly Ways and

10   Means Committee, and the Higher Education

11   Committees.   I would like to thank you for

12   the opportunity for United University

13   Professions to testify on the 2021 Executive

14   Budget for higher education.

15         My name is Dr. Fred Kowal, and I'm the

16   president of UUP.   And I do have the distinct

17   honor and privilege of representing more than

18   37,000 academic and professional faculty and

19   staff doing their work across New York State

20   at SUNY.

21         With regard to the Executive Budget

22   proposal, quite simply, the Governor's

23   proposed budget fails to provide the

24   necessary funding for SUNY.    The spending
                                                      363

 1   plan is essentially flat, which will only

 2   make things worse for our cash-tight

 3   campuses.   A 3 percent increase for public

 4   higher education is earmarked for the cost of

 5   state fringe benefits, an increase in capital

 6   bonded costs, and a planned expansion of the

 7   Excelsior Scholarship Program.

 8         We heard a great deal this morning

 9   from the chancellor, Chancellor Johnson,

10   concerning the need for philanthropic --

11   philanthropy, sorry.   I should have known how

12   to pronounce it, I heard it so often.

13         As a state we must never, never become

14   dependent on private sources of money to

15   accomplish the important public mission of

16   our state universities.   This has never been

17   more evident than in a newly proposed

18   two-to-one capital construction matching

19   program, a SUNY budget request proposal that

20   was then incorporated in the Governor's

21   proposal.

22         This proposal will divide SUNY

23   campuses into groups of haves and have-nots:

24   Campuses that can afford to access the
                                                       364

 1   matching funds, and campuses that can't.

 2   This will create a vicious cycle.    Campuses

 3   with private dollars will utilize the match

 4   and build impressive new buildings, hopefully

 5   attracting new students.   Those that can't

 6   raise the funds will continue to deteriorate

 7   and see their enrollments decline.     A system

 8   will result that will become more and more

 9   tuition-dependent, and these campuses will

10   fall further and further behind.

11         We are not a quasi-public higher

12   education system.   We are the State

13   University of New York, a public higher

14   education system.   The time has come to

15   remind and continue to remind the Chancellor

16   and the Governor that these are their

17   campuses, their hospitals, but at the same

18   time, this is the people's SUNY.     We are a

19   system, not a collection of franchisees.

20         We have heard a great deal

21   specifically in terms of funding about the

22   TAP gap.   The TAP gap in fact is a major

23   burden for our campuses.   Allow me to share

24   with you a couple of specific cases as to how
                                                       365

 1   the TAP gap has impacted, for instance, the

 2   campus at Plattsburgh, which is suffering

 3   right now under a $3 million deficit.    The

 4   TAP gap there in the last year was slightly

 5   over $2 million.   If it is addressed, that

 6   would diminish deeply the gap that that

 7   campus faces.

 8         My home campus of Cobleskill has a

 9   $2 million deficit.   Its TAP gap is

10   approximately $1 million.   Again, a long way

11   to solving the budget problems facing our

12   campuses could be achieved by addressing the

13   TAP gap.

14         I would be remiss if I did not share

15   with you the serious situation facing the

16   SUNY hospitals.    Once again, the Governor has

17   chosen to propose a budget that includes no

18   money in what is referred to as the "SUNY

19   subsidy."   We need to recall that when a

20   patient comes to a SUNY hospital or an

21   academic medical center, regardless of that

22   individual's ability to pay, the color of

23   that person's skin, the country of that

24   person's origin, the level of that person's
                                                     366

 1   education, all will receive the best care

 2   possible anywhere.

 3         However, when we look at what has

 4   happened over the last couple of years in

 5   terms of the subsidy, there have been direct

 6   impacts on patient care in the hospitals.

 7   Just this past week -- today, as a matter of

 8   fact, I received word from our chapter

 9   president at Upstate Medical University that

10   in one of the trauma care centers there was a

11   leak in the ceiling which was taken care of

12   by the use of a trash bag and a trash barrel

13   to catch the water.

14         There is such a demand for the trauma

15   and emergency room services at Upstate that

16   patients are being kept in physical therapy

17   gymnasiums and in the hallways.   This is

18   totally unsafe, while at the same time

19   undermining, for instance, HIPAA requirements

20   that these institutions must follow.

21         The hospitals need the subsidy, we

22   need to support them, it is part of the

23   central core mission of SUNY.   And that

24   mission calls on all of us to be committed to
                                                          367

 1   building a better future for our students and

 2   our state.

 3         Thank you very much.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:       Thank you.

 5         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:      You're knocking

 6   it out of the park on the timing.

 7         MR. PALLOTTA:   Professors.

 8         (Laughter.)

 9         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      It's a high

10   mark -- a high bar now, Barbara.

11         (Laughter.)

12         DR. BOWEN:    I'll try.    I'll try.

13         Good afternoon -- almost good

14   evening -- Senate Chairpersons Krueger and

15   Stavisky and Assembly Chairperson Glick.       And

16   thank you all, those of you who are here,

17   those of you who have been here for most of

18   the time, for your time and your questions.

19         And also thank you for your support

20   for CUNY, for the nearly half-million

21   students we educate, and for the 30,000

22   faculty and staff whom I represent.

23   Legislators on both sides of the aisle have

24   fought to increase funding in the past for
                                                      368

 1   community colleges, you've protected

 2   Opportunity Programs year after year, and

 3   you've understood the need to stabilize the

 4   public funding for CUNY and SUNY senior

 5   colleges, and we thank you for that.

 6         I'm proud to be here with my

 7   colleagues and also two colleagues from the

 8   PSC, Andrea Vasquez and Mike Fabricant.   We

 9   deeply appreciate, the PSC, your efforts to

10   increase funding for CUNY and your support

11   last year -- and the Governor's support --

12   for the PSC's landmark contract that we just

13   settled.   And you've heard quite a bit about

14   it.

15         But I need to tell you that CUNY

16   cannot withstand another year of New York

17   State's current funding policy.   New York's

18   policy on CUNY funding is planned poverty,

19   impoverishment by design.   State budgets that

20   consistently fail to cover even mandatory

21   costs and collective bargaining increases

22   amount to a policy of sabotaging CUNY and

23   sabotaging CUNY students.   There's no other

24   way to say that.   Not everyone here today has
                                                      369

 1   said that.   But year after year of

 2   underfunding adds up to a policy.     And that

 3   policy is deliberate underfunding for the

 4   students we teach and the students we love.

 5         So to make up for missing state

 6   funding, CUNY either cuts resources or

 7   increases tuition or both.   Neither approach

 8   is acceptable or sustainable.   Incremental

 9   cuts and flat budgets may look innocuous, but

10   repeated year after year, they amount to a

11   policy of destroying the university's

12   capacity to provide the education and support

13   CUNY students need.   On a per-student

14   basis -- and I don't think you've heard this

15   yet in all the statistics -- on a per-student

16   basis, state funding for FTE students,

17   adjusted for inflation, for CUNY senior

18   colleges, has declined by 21 percent in the

19   last decade alone.

20         How is a university supposed to

21   continue to educate students when operating

22   funds have been cut by more than a fifth, if

23   one in five students cannot get into a class

24   needed for graduation, if college libraries
                                                       370

 1   have to close one day in five, if one in five

 2   full-time faculty positions is cut, if every

 3   advisor is responsible for hundreds more

 4   students, if buildings are dilapidated, roofs

 5   leak, rats and mold endanger the classroom,

 6   and students have to navigate around buckets

 7   catching rainwater as they try to make their

 8   way to class?

 9         That any state would allow or even

10   cause such shortfalls is regrettable, and I

11   would say shameful.    But it's especially so

12   here in New York.     This state prides itself

13   on leading the nation in progressive policy,

14   and in many areas it does.     The Legislature,

15   you showed last year that you could do things

16   against the odds, you made breathtaking

17   changes in policy.    But in fiscal support for

18   public higher education, that has yet to

19   happen.   New York is far from a progressive

20   leader.   It's actually failing CUNY students.

21         The consequences are heaviest for

22   those least able to bear them.    And you've

23   heard about our students today, and we can

24   say more later.   And we know that you stand
                                                        371

 1   with us, and you have stood with us.     But

 2   this year we're asking for a higher level of

 3   commitment because nothing else will serve.

 4            So we are calling on you to make sure

 5   that full funding for CUNY's essential needs

 6   is a priority -- one of the few priorities in

 7   your conference -- and that the leaders of

 8   each house take a stand in favor of the new

 9   revenue necessary to achieve it.     We ask you

10   to refuse to pass a budget -- I know this is

11   a heavy lift -- refuse to pass a budget

12   unless it includes new revenue from

13   progressive taxation and covers CUNY's basic

14   operating costs without raising tuition.

15            So the requests that we've made you've

16   seen in our written material; they

17   concentrate on funding the unmet mandatory

18   needs.    The basic year-to-year costs of our

19   contract are not funded yet.     The chancellor

20   mentioned that he hopes that they will be

21   funded in the final budget.     We hope they

22   will.    But basic contract increases.

23            Filling the TAP gap.   That is a gap at

24   every college -- $8 million at Hunter,
                                                      372

 1   $7 million at John Jay.    Each of those

 2   places, the more students of economic need

 3   the college accepts, the more they are

 4   punished.    That is a structural deficit; it

 5   should be removed.

 6           We call on you to restore the

 7   legislative funding that you generously put

 8   in last year to increase the community

 9   college base aid.    And let me just mention

10   again this must be done without raising

11   tuition.    The tuition increase generates

12   $36 million.   The state should put that

13   public money into a public university, should

14   not extend the authorization for endless

15   tuition increases.

16           And we certainly stand with UUP on the

17   issue of capital.    It should not be based on

18   private funding match.

19           Thank you very much.

20           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

21           First up, chair of Higher Ed for the

22   Assembly, Deborah Glick.

23           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you very

24   much.
                                                       373

 1           We -- you know, those of us who are

 2   here and many who are in session now

 3   understand that the issue of the TAP gap is a

 4   very -- it's not going to get fixed in a

 5   year.   We would like to see a plan to

 6   eliminate it in a shorter period of time.

 7           But you've mentioned the collective

 8   bargaining costs, which fall to each campus.

 9   Do we have a figure for what needs to be

10   added to cover that cost?

11           DR. BOWEN:   CUNY gives a cost in their

12   breakdown of mandatory costs that are unmet,

13   and I'd rather use their figure since they've

14   worked it up.   And it can be divided by

15   campus.   And they give a figure for this

16   year.   But the increases across the board

17   were the same ones that the state has

18   insisted on, I'll say, for the other unions,

19   a 2 percent increase.

20           But we were able to do a much bigger

21   increase for adjuncts because of two things.

22   We redistributed some of that money, and also

23   we do have support from the Governor's

24   office -- which is very important -- and from
                                                      374

 1   the Mayor of New York City to pay adjuncts

 2   for hundreds of thousands of additional

 3   office hours, time with students.   So that

 4   cost we're expecting to be funded in.      And

 5   that's not visible on CUNY's sheet.

 6         DR. KOWAL:     And we're in the --

 7   presently in the fourth year of our

 8   collective bargaining agreement.    And

 9   similarly, we got the 2 percent increases.

10   We also have had new minimum salaries

11   established for adjuncts, and they go up

12   every fall semester.

13         However, calculating what that is,

14   again, I would take the same tack as my

15   colleague Dr. Bowen, and that is I would

16   depend on SUNY's number because we don't know

17   how many of the adjuncts will be in the

18   workforce and in our bargaining unit when

19   those increases go through.    So the

20   calculation can be a little tricky.

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    This is a more

22   abstract question.   We've heard that, you

23   know, there are literally millions of

24   New Yorkers who have gotten their education,
                                                      375

 1   as I did, from CUNY or SUNY at a very

 2   reasonable cost.   They're out there.   The

 3   systems are in an awkward position to reach

 4   out to alumni and say "Write to the Governor

 5   and say there's not enough money," even

 6   though I wish they would.    But, you know,

 7   they send me a very lovely little note that,

 8   you know, it was nice of you to go to Queens

 9   College, can you send us a check?   And it's

10   like, I can, I will, but you're not going to

11   get very far on it, so.

12         But I do think that we have missed the

13   boat on reaching out and having a concerted

14   effort to reach out to alumni and ask them to

15   participate.   Maybe through, you know, some

16   of your organizations you have some folks who

17   have come through the systems.   But you're

18   located everywhere, and there should be some

19   thought given to how we can harness and do an

20   outreach program together -- I'm more than

21   willing to participate in that -- in order to

22   get people to speak up.   I don't want to hear

23   from somebody who's a very lovely individual,

24   who's an ophthalmologist and I'm sure is
                                                       376

 1   making a very good living, coming to me

 2   personally and saying, You have to save SUNY.

 3   And I've said back, I'm glad you've gone on

 4   for, you know, all of this additional

 5   training and education, but maybe you're the

 6   one who should be pointing out to the powers

 7   that be above me that you, in fact, are

 8   successful in paying your taxes at a higher

 9   rate because of this education.

10         So I know I'm speaking to the choir,

11   but we haven't done it.

12         DR. BOWEN:   I have an idea, if I may.

13   I would love to work together.    As the union,

14   we have access, of course, to the addresses

15   and emails of our members, but we don't to

16   the alumni.   The colleges have not shared

17   those addresses.   If they'd be willing to

18   share them with you in a respectful,

19   non-badgering collective effort to stand for

20   CUNY, we would love to do that.   We do

21   collect alumni names when we can, and we

22   reach out to people.   One in 16 New Yorkers

23   is a CUNY student right now -- and then think

24   of how that multiplies with graduates and
                                                        377

 1   workers.   You know, every subway car you get

 2   on, there are probably eight people who are

 3   involved with CUNY.

 4          So we would love to partner with you,

 5   and I say this quite seriously.    It's a

 6   brilliant idea, and perhaps there's a way

 7   with the Legislature that would be respectful

 8   of people's privacy and not intrusive that we

 9   could draw on that very wide network of

10   people who love this university.    I mean, it

11   changes lives.   There are so many people who

12   say:   CUNY made my life, CUNY saved me.    They

13   should be a strong force with us.   And I

14   would love to partner with you in an

15   appropriate way to do that.

16          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you.

17          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

18          Senator Toby Stavisky, Higher Ed chair

19   in the Senate.

20          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

21          As I was sitting here at the hearing

22   this morning at 10:01 a.m., my email came in

23   and it said "This is the weekend to be in

24   Syracuse, Toby," and it tells me all the
                                                       378

 1   reasons.     And at the bottom it says, "Make a

 2   gift."     Enough said.   Let me get to my

 3   questions.

 4            We've been hearing a great deal about

 5   the TAP gap.    Are there any structural

 6   changes in the governance of CUNY and SUNY

 7   that we should look at to avoid this -- to

 8   mitigate, perhaps, some of the effects of the

 9   TAP gap?

10            DR. KOWAL:   I would offer a couple of

11   different ideas on that.     I think it's an

12   important question.

13            One of the problems at SUNY, and it

14   has grown to be, I think, a very serious

15   problem, is that -- and I use the term

16   franchisees.    Unfortunately, SUNY seems to be

17   less and less of a system than a collection

18   of semi-independent colleges that are left on

19   their own.

20            And so the cases that I highlighted --

21   and that was just a couple, in the interests

22   of time.     These campuses are out there on

23   their own dealing with, you know, enrollment

24   challenges, in part because of where they're
                                                       379

 1   located, far upstate, and then secondly

 2   because of the structure of the TAP program.

 3   And they take a lot of TAP students, a lot of

 4   our upstate campuses do, and they are also

 5   the ones that are suffering the most.

 6         What we find is within SUNY, instead

 7   of there being a collective effort to address

 8   the structure of the TAP program so that we

 9   get rid of the ceiling in terms of what

10   campuses get for full TAP awardees and all

11   TAP awardees, there is instead, you know, a

12   situation literally where campuses, if they

13   fall into financial difficulty, are offered

14   the opportunity to take loans from the

15   system.

16         I don't understand that.    SUNY is not

17   a bank.    SUNY is one university system.   And

18   if there are campuses or the system has the

19   resources, then it must be used to assist

20   those campuses who are taking more TAP

21   students, more full-award TAP students, which

22   means the students who can least afford to go

23   to SUNY.   And they're doing the good work,

24   and they should be rewarded for that and not
                                                     380

 1   punished.

 2           So that would be the initial thing in

 3   terms of this structure that's become far too

 4   decentralized.   And with SUNY, with this

 5   laissez-faire approach, until the campuses

 6   become really troubled economically or

 7   financially and then SUNY steps in and says,

 8   Well, if you want a loan, we will give you a

 9   loan.   That is not how the SUNY system ought

10   to operate.

11           DR. BOWEN:   I would just add, if I

12   may, that I think the main problem is -- at

13   least as far as CUNY is concerned, is not in

14   the governance of the university but in the

15   structure of the law itself, which mandates

16   that the students don't pay the cost above

17   the maximum TAP award but the colleges absorb

18   that cost, which is about $2,000 a person.

19           And so really it's the law that needs

20   to change.    The consequence I'm sure was

21   unintended, and it's punishing the colleges

22   for each student they take who's on a TAP or

23   Excelsior award, and all the new DREAM Act

24   students.    So it was not the intended
                                                        381

 1   consequence, and I think it really needs to

 2   be changed.

 3           And I would also suggest that before

 4   the state considers an extension of the SUNY

 5   2020 ability to raise tuition $200 every year

 6   in advance of the 2025 version, that we look

 7   at TAP.   And that the tuition-granting

 8   authority to raise tuition should not be

 9   permitted, should not be incorporated this

10   year.   It should be done -- we think it

11   should not be done at all, and it certainly

12   shouldn't be done as a stand-alone before the

13   rest of the law comes in.

14           MR. PALLOTTA:   And this had been only

15   an issue for the four-year campuses, and now

16   the community colleges are also seeing the

17   same thing.   Because state support is

18   25 percent; it should be 40 percent.     And the

19   students are putting in more.

20           SENATOR STAVISKY:   One quick question.

21   Actually, I have another.    Two quick

22   questions.

23           The contract that was just signed

24   by -- fortunately just signed and ratified by
                                                         382

 1   Professional Staff Congress, are there any

 2   suggestions in terms of the payment or

 3   coverage for the mandated costs as well as

 4   some of the other costs, the rentals and --

 5   you know, and the maintenance of effort, if

 6   you --

 7            DR. BOWEN:   Certainly the union -- the

 8   PSC and CUNY administration are united in

 9   calling for those costs to be covered.       That

10   is the cost across the board of across the

11   board increases.

12            And in the past, what the colleges

13   have had to do is sequester 2 percent out of

14   their budgets to cover that anticipated cost.

15   That means that something is being cut, or

16   else tuition is being imposed, an increase --

17            SENATOR STAVISKY:   That's my point.

18            DR. BOWEN:   That is not fair.   We --

19   the purpose of our contract was not to raise

20   students' tuition.    We are in solidarity with

21   them.

22            Nor is it to cut another program,

23   because the benefit of your raise is

24   diminished if then you come to your
                                                     383

 1   department and find that you have no Xerox

 2   paper and you can't hire anyone.    You don't

 3   feel so -- that your raise is so valuable

 4   when your working conditions every day are

 5   sabotaging your work.

 6         SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Assembly.

 8         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Assemblymember

 9   Epstein.

10         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   I want to really

11   thank you all for highlighting some of the

12   structural problems we have here and really

13   advocating to deal with the TAP gap and raise

14   the TAP payment for students.

15         I wanted to focus on a different

16   topic, because we've heard a lot around

17   mental health services for students and the

18   dire need that we see students placed in, and

19   the ration that currently exists.   Can you

20   tell us what's going on on campuses and what

21   you're hearing from students around the lack

22   of adequate mental health services and what

23   impact that's having on our students across

24   the state?
                                                       384

 1         DR. KOWAL:     Well, I would just

 2   basically share two things.

 3         One is with the -- certainly with the

 4   economic stress that students are under,

 5   these issues have become more and more

 6   severe.    We have heard, through the course of

 7   today, the electronic communication system

 8   for counseling, well, that's based at

 9   Upstate.   And the amount of the money that is

10   budgeted for that is only $700,000.   The

11   number of calls they get, you know, it's off

12   the chart.

13         And so again, the lack of funding

14   becomes a problem.   And if we are serious in

15   ensuring that students have the best possible

16   setting for their education and for their

17   lives, there needs to be a greater investment

18   for that sort of resource.

19         DR. BOWEN:     The national accrediting

20   organization on psychological mental health

21   counselors recommends at college a ratio of

22   one counselor to 1,000 students, assuming

23   that students have other forms of support --

24   one to a thousand.
                                                         385

 1            At CUNY the current ratio is one to

 2   2,700.    So I think that tells a story.

 3            Then add to that the fact that most of

 4   our students suffer tremendous odds,

 5   encounter tremendous odds.      And of course the

 6   biggest stressor, one of -- the biggest,

 7   certainly, material stressor of all is

 8   poverty.    So we strongly support the premise

 9   that there should be more mental health

10   counselors.

11            But the union opposes the way that

12   CUNY has proposed to address that, which is a

13   kind of ironic imposition of a mental health

14   and wellness fee, an additional $120 fee,

15   that many students simply can't afford to

16   pay.   And when one of the biggest stressors

17   is poverty, together with, you know, working

18   at low-wage jobs, being a parent, the

19   constant racism in our society -- and then to

20   address it, you add a fee -- that's not the

21   appropriate way to address it.     So we need

22   to -- the state needs to step up and invest

23   there.

24            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Well, thank you
                                                       386

 1   for saying that.      I agree that the fees

 2   aren't appropriate, and there are so many

 3   fees -- book fees, miscellaneous fees that

 4   TAP doesn't cover and students have to pay

 5   out of pocket.    I think if we move towards

 6   reducing those fees, that would be great.

 7            I know I'm out of time, but I want to

 8   ask you about looking for dedicated funding

 9   streams for CUNY and SUNY, what you think

10   about having dedicated streams of funding

11   that could go directly to our public higher

12   education system.

13            DR. KOWAL:    I think that Barbara put

14   it best, in terms of the necessity for us to

15   address the revenue side.      If we are

16   committed to a public good, which is what

17   public higher education is, then the society

18   must invest.    And right now we have the

19   resources to do it.      It's just a matter of

20   making sure that the instruments are put in

21   place.    And it's over time, it's past time

22   for this to be done.

23            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

24            Senator Robert Jackson, I didn't ask
                                                        387

 1   you in advance, but I bet I know you do have

 2   a question.

 3           SENATOR JACKSON:   And you're right.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    I know you very

 5   well.

 6           (Laughter.)

 7           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Senator Robert

 8   Jackson.

 9           SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you.

10           So very quick, I understand that

11   there's been no increase in the budget this

12   year compared to last year.    So when it talks

13   about maintenance of effort, is there enough

14   money to run your programs and give all of

15   the raises that educators rightfully deserve?

16   Can you do that, in your opinion, without

17   cutting back on staff and cutting back on

18   programs?

19           DR. BOWEN:    I'm not in charge of that,

20   but my answer would be no.     The budget is

21   essentially flat.     There's an increase in the

22   fringe benefits part of the fringe benefit

23   increase; $24.3 million is covered.     There

24   are some other increases the chancellor spoke
                                                         388

 1   about to a program here and there.      Those are

 2   all good.

 3         But when the costs of rent and

 4   electricity that go up, when other licensing

 5   costs go up and are not covered, and when a

 6   2 percent increase across the board for

 7   30,000 people is not covered, that money has

 8   got to come from somewhere.

 9         SENATOR JACKSON:      So how much more

10   money would you need in the budget -- I think

11   in your testimony you said you needed --

12         DR. BOWEN:   Right, we said 208 million

13   for unmet mandatory needs and the TAP gap at

14   the senior colleges.   Just the unmet

15   mandatory needs, the way that CUNY management

16   puts them together, I think they have

17   126 million.   So it's --

18         SENATOR JACKSON:      And that's just to

19   meet CUNY.

20         DR. BOWEN:   Just CUNY.     And that

21   doesn't cover the community college base aid.

22   This is a -- so for the community colleges,

23   another 25 million.

24         SENATOR JACKSON:      And with respect to
                                                       389

 1   SUNY -- when the chancellor for CUNY was

 2   there, he talked about people in the district

 3   that were employees or graduated from CUNY.

 4   Well, there are four members of my family

 5   that have graduated from SUNY -- three from

 6   SUNY New Paltz and one from the University at

 7   Buffalo.

 8            So with respect to the SUNY budget,

 9   how does that impact, from your perspective

10   as the president of UUP, with respect to your

11   staff?

12            DR. KOWAL:   It's incredibly difficult

13   to see any kind of optimistic future, I hate

14   to say it, when I travel across the state.

15   And I have visited all of the campuses many

16   times, as the chancellor has said she has

17   visited the campuses.    I hope she's listening

18   to what people are saying, because campuses

19   are suffering.    They have budgets that are

20   requiring, even at the university centers, to

21   have hiring freezes?    There is not enough

22   money to pay the necessary costs.

23            And when you look at the SUNY

24   hospitals, as I described the situation just
                                                        390

 1   at Upstate -- and Upstate is in good shape

 2   financially -- there is a real danger in

 3   terms of services not being done and, in

 4   terms of the hospitals, lives endangered.

 5   That's the reality.

 6         SENATOR JACKSON:      So here's a question

 7   for both of you.   And I only have 19 seconds.

 8   With respect to the TAP gap, if in fact the

 9   proposal to continue tuition increase through

10   '24-'25, if that was eliminated and we freeze

11   it, what impact would that have on both CUNY

12   and SUNY?   That's my last question.

13         DR. BOWEN:    It would freeze the amount

14   of the TAP gap.    Of course it's dependent on

15   enrollment.   But of course every time that

16   the -- so it would freeze the amount of that.

17   And the real solution, of course, is I would

18   say to eliminate tuition.    But certainly that

19   would stop some of the growth.

20         SENATOR JACKSON:     SUNY?

21         DR. KOWAL:      Yeah, exactly.   It would

22   freeze the growth of the TAP gap.      And that

23   would be a help, but the gap would still

24   remain in terms of lost resources.

 1            SENATOR JACKSON:   Thank you.

 2            Thank you, Madam Chair.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 4            Assembly.

 5            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Assemblymember

 6   Hyndman.

 7            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    Thank you,

 8   Chair.

 9            Just a quick question, because some of

10   my other questions were asked.      For Andrew,

11   do you keep a number of how many of your

12   members are SUNY or CUNY grads?

13            MR. PALLOTTA:   Off the top of my head,

14   I don't know.    And we certainly -- we could

15   certainly -- we don't because those records

16   would be kept by SUNY in their HR offices, so

17   we don't know where individual faculty

18   members, for instance, get their terminal

19   degrees or where they receive their

20   undergraduate --

21            ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:    No, it was

22   just along the lines of the questions that

23   Chairwoman Glick was asking about, you know,

24   making sure that the masses realize what's at
                                                        392

 1   stake here.

 2         I mean, I went to SUNY New Paltz --

 3   yay -- so I often get solicitations for --

 4         MR. PALLOTTA:    Right, when we're out

 5   in the halls of the Capitol and the LOB, we

 6   see the posters that say all these folks went

 7   to SUNY and all these folks went to CUNY.     So

 8   we know that there's a lot out there, but we

 9   don't actually have that stat.    That would be

10   an interesting --

11         DR. KOWAL:    We could survey members,

12   but -- you know, and it's getting back to the

13   earlier question.   What I would like to see

14   is for us to find those alumni of SUNY and

15   those especially who are at the higher income

16   levels and get them involved in a campaign

17   where they exert pressure and say they are

18   willing to pay more in taxes to support the

19   public university system.   I think that could

20   go a long way to help as well.

21         ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:     Thank you.

22         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Anyone else?     I

23   have just one question.   So I'm reading a

24   paper put out by the Center on Budget and
                                                       393

 1   Policy Priorities, a well-respected liberal

 2   think tank, and it's showing me that all the

 3   states have cut funding for higher education

 4   over the last decade.   But it's showing

 5   New York basically at the least cuts; we're

 6   like only down 2 percent.

 7         So I'm wondering, besides the fact

 8   that we don't invest enough and we probably

 9   didn't 10 years ago either, are we spending

10   it wrong?    Because if you look at their data,

11   we aren't doing as badly as most of the other

12   50 states.   So I'm really curious whether we

13   also think that when we have the money, we're

14   not using it correctly for our colleges.

15         DR. BOWEN:    No, I think what has to be

16   factored in there is TAP.   We'd have to look

17   carefully at those statistics because many of

18   them put TAP as the Governor's budget does,

19   put TAP right in there as an allocation.   And

20   also as the Governor's budget does, as you

21   know, puts any authorization for an increase

22   in tuition as an increase in the budget.

23         So you are great at reading these, so

24   we should look at them together.   Because TAP
                                                        394

 1   is a program that covers many students:

 2   56,000 students at CUNY.   New York has an

 3   unusual program with TAP -- remember, it goes

 4   to the private colleges and for-profit

 5   colleges as well as the public colleges.     But

 6   that's where our spending is concentrated,

 7   and not in the operating budgets.

 8         And that's why we're cutting classes.

 9   I mean, that's why at Queens College the

10   semester began with telling them they'd have

11   to cut a thousand seats out of basic English

12   courses.   I mean, we are hurting already, let

13   along what would happen next year.

14         So I think we'd have to look at those

15   figures and consider TAP in there.

16         DR. KOWAL:     I think the other part of

17   this is that some other states have just, you

18   know, gone through some draconian cuts.    We

19   saw what happened at the University of

20   Alaska, but other states where there have

21   been massive cuts.    And so, you know, if we

22   set the bar low enough, then New York is

23   going to look okay.

24         I think the other problem too is --
                                                       395

 1   and we heard some pointed questions this

 2   morning concerning the issue of diversity in

 3   SUNY, in the faculty and staff specifically.

 4   One of the problems that we see all the time

 5   is because of the inability or the

 6   unwillingness of campuses to recruit and

 7   retain faculty members from communities of

 8   color -- and that means paying them

 9   competitive salaries because there's a great

10   deal of demand across higher education for

11   these highly skilled individuals.    Which is

12   why UUP has proposed taking the successful

13   EOP program, providing a program like that

14   specifically for medical education, to get

15   more diversity into our medical schools and

16   in the medical profession.

17         And by the way, I just want to make

18   that note as well.   Though we are thankful

19   that the Governor did not cut the Opportunity

20   Programs this year, I for one am not going to

21   celebrate that.   I think that, you know,

22   having four straight years of flat budgets in

23   Opportunity Programs is not a good thing.     I

24   think that what's necessary is for those
                                                               396

 1   programs to grow.      They're very successful,

 2   and they help address the issue of access.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you for all

 4   being with us here this afternoon.

 5   Appreciate it.

 6            MR. PALLOTTA:   Thank you.

 7            DR. BOWEN:    Thank you so much.

 9            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

10            All right.    And our next is a panel of

11   CUNY University Student Senate -- oh, I'm

12   sorry, excuse me.      Blair Horner, NYPIRG --

13   thank you -- before we get to the panel.            And

14   there may also be Santana Alvarado --

19            MR. HORNER:   Ready?

20            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Yes, when you're

21   ready.

22            MS. ALVARADO:   Good afternoon.       My

23   name is Santana Alvarado, and I am the

24   chairperson of the New York Public Interest
                                                       397

 1   Research Group's Student Board of Directors

 2   and a City University of New York Hunter

 3   College student.

 4         With me today is Wali Ullah, a NYPIRG

 5   policy associate and a student at City

 6   College, as well as Blair Horner, NYPIRG's

 7   executive director.

 8         NYPIRG is a statewide nonpartisan,

 9   nonprofit organization founded by college

10   students in 1973 to engage their peers in

11   civic life.    NYPIRG's broad programmatic work

12   provides students with a range of

13   opportunities to participate in public

14   affairs and advance responses to social

15   problems that matter most to them.

16         Our board of directors consists of

17   college and university students elected from

18   the State University of New York, CUNY, and

19   independent college campuses with NYPIRG

20   chapters.

21         Before I get into our testimony on

22   behalf of NYPIRG, thank you so much for last

23   year's approval of the Senator Jose Peralta

24   DREAM Act.    We worked closely with Senator
                                                     398

 1   Peralta for years, and thank you for

 2   broadening financial aid eligibility to

 3   undocumented immigrant public college

 4   students.

 5         You have our written testimony, and

 6   I'd like to underscore some recommendations

 7   for your consideration.   In terms of tuition

 8   policy, as you will see in our testimony, the

 9   financial impact of New York's policy of

10   annually increasing public college tuition

11   has increased the costs of attending SUNY and

12   CUNY by billions of dollars.    Yet from

13   anecdotal evidence that we've seen and heard,

14   the state's commitment to maintain financial

15   support has fallen far short.

16         As you will see in our testimony,

17   public colleges across the state have

18   reported declining services and cutbacks to

19   meet the educational needs of students.    In

20   short, it looks like students are paying a

21   lot more and not getting enhanced services.

22   In fact, at least in some cases we are

23   getting less.   The clearest evidence of this

24   problem is the TAP gap, which we urge you to
                                                       399

 1   close.

 2            Tuition hikes should be stopped.

 3   NYPIRG urges you to freeze college tuition

 4   rates and to reject the Governor's proposal

 5   for additional annual hikes for the next five

 6   years.

 7            In terms of financial aid, as you will

 8   see in our testimony, there are a number of

 9   issues we would address.    In our view, the

10   most critical step that you can take is to

11   modernize the state's TAP program.     The

12   current system creates campus-specific budget

13   gaps resulting from the growing difference

14   between the maximum TAP award and the

15   mushrooming tuition costs.

16            In addition, deserving students, such

17   as graduate students, have lost public

18   support.    TAP needs to be modernized to help

19   today's college students to provide coverage

20   for graduate and part-time students and

21   incarcerated individuals, as well as other

22   enhancements.    Such changes will benefit both

23   the public and independent sectors.

24            MR. ULLAH:   We applaud the Governor's
                                                     400

 1   proposal to maintain the funding levels for

 2   the state's various Opportunity Programs.

 3   Financial aid should, first and foremost,

 4   help low- and moderate-income college

 5   students and their families to make it

 6   through their studies.

 7         As you know, there has been an annual

 8   budget dance, so to speak, in which the

 9   Governor proposes less funding for

10   Opportunity Programs and the Legislature adds

11   it back in.   But the result has been simply

12   status quo funding -- essentially a cut, when

13   factoring in inflation.

14         The Governor's support for these

15   programs is important.    His plan opens the

16   door to further enhancement of these

17   incredibly successful efforts.    Just a few

18   observations from our written testimony.

19   First-year retention, where a student

20   re-enrolls for a second year, for SUNY senior

21   college EOP students is 91 percent, whereas

22   first-year retention students from the

23   general student body at senior colleges in

24   SUNY is approximately 84 percent.
                                                     401

 1         Secondly, the six-year graduation rate

 2   for EOP students is 73 percent, whereas the

 3   rate for non-EOP students at SUNY is 68

 4   percent.

 5         Clearly these programs work, and they

 6   deserve additional support.   And SUNY's ASAP

 7   should also be restored.

 8         MS. ALVARADO:    NYPIRG urges you to

 9   restore cuts to the community colleges.

10         As you will see in our testimony, the

11   situation in CUNY and SUNY is dramatically

12   different.   The City University of New York

13   has maintained low tuition and has a stable

14   community college system.   SUNY community

15   colleges, on the other hand, have seen

16   plummeting enrollments and have had to hike

17   tuition in order to meet financial

18   obligations.    The CUNY system should not be

19   penalized for its support and its efforts,

20   and the SUNY system needs help.   We urge

21   restorations.

22         In addition, we urge restorations to

23   SUNY and CUNY childcare programs, which are

24   vital to students.
                                                       402

 1            Lastly, we live in an era of rapid

 2   climate changes which could easily lead to

 3   climate catastrophe for the planet.     We urge

 4   and support the sustainability efforts in

 5   both SUNY and CUNY as well as the independent

 6   college sectors.

 7            Thank you for the opportunity to

 8   testify.

 9            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

10            First up, Deborah Glick, Higher

11   Education, Assembly.

12            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   You've heard

13   that the TAP gap is an enormous amount of

14   money.    It's not going to happen -- if we

15   were able to make adjustments, it would cost

16   something like $50 million a year for several

17   years.

18            Do you have thoughts about what -- how

19   the government should view eliminating that?

20            MR. HORNER:   Just to add, we talk

21   about in our testimony that the best way to

22   deal with it would be to restore the TAP

23   program.    Prior to SUNY 2020, the deal was

24   when tuition went up, the maximum TAP award
                                                      403

 1   went up, and you didn't have a TAP gap.

 2         And so if it ultimately comes down to

 3   that, that would be our preference, and

 4   certainly in the short term to fill the gap

 5   with student resources is one way to sort of

 6   deal with it, but it does turn into sort of

 7   an annual problem.   And as tuition goes up,

 8   the gap gets bigger and the hit to the

 9   colleges gets bigger.    And you've heard

10   the -- all morning, all afternoon, and into

11   the evening how the TAP gap causes problems

12   on college campuses, and we document some of

13   that in our testimony.

14         But again, we think the best solution

15   would be to just start dealing with the TAP

16   program and do what it's supposed to do.

17         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     NYPIRG over the

18   years has done a very effective job of

19   raising awareness of issues, and thank you

20   for doing that.   And I've talked to some of

21   my friends in labor about how do we reach out

22   to alumni, and some of the students -- not

23   all -- many of the students are first in

24   their family to go to school, but they may
                                                       404

 1   have neighbors who are not.

 2           Do you have suggestions or thoughts

 3   about what we can do to raise awareness and

 4   activate alumni to take a more active role in

 5   advocating?    Since you've obviously been able

 6   to get students engaged.

 7           MS. ALVARADO:   Right.   So I'm

 8   graduating, upcoming in June, so I'll soon be

 9   an alumna.    And I don't know, I feel

10   personally on campus, as a student, there's a

11   lot of isolation going on about what we can

12   talk about and what we feel like we're going

13   through alone versus other students.

14           And I feel like that would continue on

15   into alumni realm.   I feel like people are

16   dealing with trauma from going to CUNY and

17   SUNY.   They're dealing with anxiety and

18   they're dealing with not having college work

19   out the way they thought it would in the

20   economy as it changes and as, you know, the

21   market changes and technology changes.

22           So I feel like engaging them on like

23   how they actually felt about going to CUNY

24   and SUNY, I think you'd be a little surprised
                                                     405

 1   about what people say about the colleges that

 2   you all went to.    And that shouldn't be --

 3   you know, you shouldn't just reach out to

 4   alumni to be like, Yo, we want to know what

 5   you have to say and we want your money -- we

 6   want to actually know how they felt and what

 7   they would have changed.   Because we're

 8   encouraging students from high school to go

 9   to CUNY and SUNY, and are we going to still

10   have those same problems when they graduate?

11         So I think just meeting them heart to

12   heart and saying, honestly, I'm sorry you had

13   to go through what you went through when you

14   were a student.

15         MR. HORNER:    Just --

16         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Do you have to

17   prove that you have health insurance when you

18   go to school?

19         MS. ALVARADO:    Yes?    No, I don't

20   believe I've had to prove that I've had

21   health insurance.    I also don't go to my

22   campus at all to get any health services.

23         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Well, I'm just

24   wondering that -- this institution of a fee
                                                      406

 1   for mental health services was the latest

 2   little wrinkle.    So I'm wondering whether or

 3   not students are being asked to pay a fee for

 4   which they already have coverage, and like

 5   what's that about.

 6          MR. HORNER:   Again, we -- there's a

 7   lot of issues with various fees.    I mean, as

 8   you know, under state law and federal law,

 9   people are covered up to the age of 26 and 29

10   respectively, if their parents have insurance

11   and they're willing to pay the rider to do

12   it.   If they're low-income, they're eligible

13   for Medicaid.

14          The fee is, you know, certainly from

15   our view the kind of thing that should be

16   coming out of tuition.   And if you're going

17   to have tuition, which we don't even like

18   that either.    But not that it would be a

19   separate fee.

20          So again, I defer to their experience

21   in college.    And I'm not, as you can tell.

22   But in terms of sort of the structure of

23   those issues, that's the way we'd look at it.

24          Let me just mention one quick thing
                                                      407

 1   about the alums.   You asked the unions about

 2   it before.   The tricky part is how do you get

 3   the list.    And then in an organization,

 4   little organization like ours, how do you

 5   work through the students to get to build a

 6   list.

 7           What we have done in the past, which

 8   has been somewhat successful, is working with

 9   the community near the campus that benefits

10   from the existence of it, in the same way as

11   you would with any large employer.   There's

12   many, many, many small businesses.   And

13   because they're in a contained geographic

14   area, it's easier to get to them than it is

15   to a diffuse alum situation where, you know,

16   people could be anywhere and it's hard to

17   track them down and may be more expensive.

18           So that's the way we've sort of tried

19   to attack in terms of broadening the sort of

20   the coalition effort around these issues, is

21   to look at the various community elements

22   that are connected to the campus itself and

23   close enough by that you could get them

24   activated.   And they understand why it's
                                                       408

 1   important.

 2            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Thank you.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Toby Stavisky,

 4   Senate Higher Ed.

 5            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 6            I know NYPIRG very well, as Blair

 7   knows, and I know you not only are speaking

 8   for the college students, but you've also

 9   done a lot of work over the years in terms of

10   environmental issues.

11            And how do you -- any suggestions for

12   SUNY and CUNY and the independent colleges in

13   terms of protecting our environment,

14   sustainability issues?

15            MR. HORNER:   Yeah, we offered some

16   detailed testimony on that, I think it was

17   last month or the month before.     I'll gladly

18   send it to you, Senator, in terms of these

19   ideas.    I mean, it's -- it's the -- I mean,

20   when I talk to people on colleges, this is

21   the single biggest thing they bring up

22   because it's their future.      If you believe

23   science, their future is threatened.

24            And so it's the same across the board,
                                                          409

 1   no matter what institution we're in, that's

 2   what you hear the most, is about climate

 3   change.    And so we had specific suggestions

 4   reacting to I think the SUNY chancellor's

 5   ideas in the hearings that occurred, and I'm

 6   glad to get them to you.

 7            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

 8            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Assembly?   Anyone

 9   else?

10            MR. HORNER:   Could I just mention one

11   quick thing before I go?     Assemblymember

12   Epstein brought up the questions about the

13   breakdown in TAP.      The HESC annual report

14   which is out breaks it down very detailed in

15   terms of numbers of recipients by sector, by

16   how much money they get.

17            And there was an issue brought up

18   about how many -- the percentage of people

19   that benefit from the Excelsior program that

20   apply.    Syracuse.com put out an analysis a

21   few months ago that showed about half of the

22   people who applied for Excelsior get it, and

23   of the remaining half, half of them do not

24   get it for other reasons.      So about a quarter
                                                      410

 1   of the people who apply receive it.

 2           And then we have some interesting data

 3   on Excelsior on page 12 of our testimony

 4   which looks at the current academic year and

 5   compares it to last year, to look at the

 6   numbers that might be useful in terms of your

 7   deliberations.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you very

 9   much.

10           MS. ALVARADO:   Thank you.

11           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Now we go to a

12   panel of CUNY University Student Senate:

13   Timothy Hunter, Nicole Agu, and Juvanie

14   Piquant.

15           Hi.   You're sharing five minutes, so

16   make sure that you don't cut each other

17   off -- or don't go on too long so that the

18   other can't speak a little bit.      Okay?

19           MS. PIQUANT:    Good afternoon,

20   everyone.     Thank you, members of the Senate

21   and Assembly.    Thank you for holding this

22   hearing.    I see many --

23           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Hold the

24   microphone a little closer.
                                                       411

 1            MS. PIQUANT:    I see many familiar

 2   faces.    I'm pretty sure you know why we're

 3   here.    But quite frankly, I don't think we

 4   should be here.    We have classes, and we're

 5   missing class to go advocate for a quality

 6   and fully funded higher education, where I

 7   quite frankly think it's ridiculous.      But

 8   allow me to divulge into the list of issues

 9   that we have over at CUNY.

10            My name is Juvanie Piquant.    I am a

11   sophomore at City Tech majoring in law and

12   paralegal studies.      But this journey hasn't

13   been easy.    I pay every single dollar out of

14   my own pocket for tuition.      Yes, 70 percent

15   of our students go to college for free, but

16   I'm a part of that percentage that does not.

17   Even the percentage that does go to school

18   for free are still impacted by the TAP gap

19   and these irrational tuition increases.

20            For us to be here on a Tuesday

21   afternoon pleading for the investment we

22   deserve in a quality higher education is

23   quite frankly ridiculous.     Fully funded

24   higher education is a right, and it is not
                                                      412

 1   something we should be begging for.

 2         Amongst the many problems we are

 3   facing at CUNY senior colleges, our community

 4   colleges are also being affected as well.

 5   We've been experiencing a drastic enrollment

 6   decrease in community colleges.   However,

 7   that doesn't mean quality resources should be

 8   decreased as well.

 9         With the new faculty contract, we need

10   the State Legislature to step up for

11   additional funding or else the burden will

12   fall on the backs of students.    We are

13   calling for an increase in base aid funding

14   for community colleges.   The Executive Budget

15   maintains base operating aid for community

16   colleges at $2,947 per full-time equivalent

17   student.   However, the 98 percent funding

18   floor that was included in the enacted budget

19   is not continued, resulting in a $3.6 million

20   decrease in base aid funding.

21         We support CUNY's budget requesting a

22   funding increase by $250 per student in

23   community college funding and restore

24   98 percent funding for the 2018-2019 level.
                                                      413

 1         This brings me to my second point.

 2   Childcare center funding --

 3         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      And you've used

 4   up half the time for the three of you.     So

 5   I'm just letting you know.

 6         MS. AGU:     Hi, everyone.   My name is

 7   Nicole Agu, and I'm an international student

 8   at the College of Staten Island in the City

 9   University of New York.

10         I'm studying dual majors in accounting

11   and international business, and minoring in

12   finance and business data analytics, and I

13   currently serve as a student government

14   senator, club commissioner, and the

15   University Student Senate delegate on my CUNY

16   campus.     In addition, I serve as the vice

17   chair for international students in the

18   University Student Senate in CUNY.

19         And I also want to appreciate every

20   Senator here for holding a hearing to listen

21   to students' testimony on how urgent it is

22   that you should consider funding CUNY

23   entirely.

24         So as an international student, we are
                                                     414

 1   required by the federal government to show to

 2   the college that we can support ourselves

 3   financially in the United States.    That is

 4   sufficient funding based on the projected

 5   tuition and fees at that time.

 6         And why am I emphasizing on this?

 7   Because the tuition hikes every year, it

 8   affects the projected tuition that we are

 9   supposed to show for it, you know, as a

10   financial aid throughout our college journey.

11   But with the projected tuition, it's

12   overshadowed when the tuition keeps

13   increasing, and so that creates a really

14   heavy financial burden on us, as we already

15   pay three times more than the domestic

16   students.

17         So I'm trying to share my story that

18   it has not been easy for me, considering that

19   I've been here on my own, catering for

20   myself, applying for scholarships,

21   contributing to the economy in the best way

22   that I can, and it is very important that

23   higher education should be invested, because

24   every student, regardless of their status,
                                                      415

 1   deserves an affordable college education.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

 3         And then I'm going to move over to our

 4   third testifier.

 5         MR. HUNTER:    So my name is Timothy

 6   Hunter, and I'm the student trustee for the

 7   City University of New York and the

 8   University Student Senate chairperson.     I'm

 9   also the student government president at

10   New York City College of Technology, which

11   Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon represents.

12         So, you know, I think -- again,

13   Senator Liz Krueger, I think that it's so sad

14   and kind of sickening for me personally that

15   we bring students all the way from the city

16   to come here to Albany to fight for something

17   that they deserve.   And for us to only get

18   five minutes to speak, I think that's

19   something that we should strongly consider.

20   After sitting here and having to listen to

21   the chancellor and other people dancing

22   around questions, direct questions, like

23   Assemblymember Epstein asked, do you

24   appreciate the funding that you got in the
                                                     416

 1   budget, and people couldn't even give a

 2   straight answer.

 3         So I think that the only -- I had some

 4   things that I wanted to say, but the only

 5   thing I'm going to say is this is not just a

 6   funding issue, this is an equity issue.    I

 7   think that CUNY serves a population of

 8   students a majority of which are black and

 9   brown students, a majority of which are

10   immigrant students.   And to have

11   international students who pay almost triple

12   the price and students who go for, quote

13   unquote, free through TAP awards, still not

14   getting the same education, I think it's sad.

15   My library closes at 8 o'clock now because of

16   the TAP gap, so I get out of class at 8:30 --

17   all my classes get out at 8:30 or 9 o'clock

18   because, you know, I do this as my day job.

19   And for me to not even have a library to go

20   to -- like if I don't have internet at home,

21   if my public library is closed, how do I even

22   study for class?

23         You know, and I think that -- again,

24   I'm going to just reiterate, this is an
                                                        417

 1   equity issue.   Cuts to ASAP?    ASAP only helps

 2   students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

 3   There's an ASAP student behind me, right,

 4   that went from a 2.4 GPA to the Dean's List

 5   because he started receiving ASAP.

 6         And I think that it's super important

 7   that we try to like, you know, preserve these

 8   programs.   And it's not just the he said, she

 9   said, the Republicans, the Democrats, the

10   Governor, the Budget Director -- this is the

11   time where the State Legislature steps up and

12   does what they can.    It's not waiting for a

13   veto-proof majority, this is doing what we

14   need to do to fund public higher education

15   and make sure that it's a right.

16         So thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:       Thank you.

18         Deborah Glick, Higher Ed, Assembly.

19         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:      I very much

20   appreciate your referencing the impacts, the

21   real-life impacts.    So if you are working,

22   you take classes -- I spent a lot of time

23   working full-time, going to -- of course I

24   didn't have to worry about tuition.
                                                     418

 1         So you said your library closes at 8.

 2   What is the general circumstance, that on

 3   most classes where the limitation that you

 4   have on accessing the same services that some

 5   other student who can go during the day

 6   full-time isn't facing?

 7         MR. HUNTER:   So I think that this is

 8   something that is a campus-by-campus basis.

 9   Because of the TAP gap, which

10   disproportionately affects schools that take

11   in more TAP recipients -- and I'm pretty sure

12   you know this.   So let's say if School A

13   takes in 80 percent TAP recipients and

14   School B takes in almost 40 percent, and

15   like, you know, School B has more students

16   coming in paying that full tuition and

17   therefore would have more revenue.   But then

18   looking at School A that says, Well, I'll

19   take in more of these TAP recipients, they're

20   being disproportionately affected.

21         So schools like City Tech, when I last

22   spoke to President Hotzler, I think it's like

23   60 percent.   That's where like the TAP --

24   like the amount of students that are coming
                                                       419

 1   with the TAP.

 2         And I think the worst part about it is

 3   City Tech is a comprehensive school -- and

 4   I'm pretty sure Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon

 5   knows this -- so they offer associate degree

 6   programs and bachelor degree programs.     But

 7   at CUNY, our associate degree tuition is

 8   around $4,000 and our senior college tuition

 9   is around $6,900.   So guess which price the

10   students that are going to City Tech for an

11   associate's degree program are paying?     Of

12   course that senior college amount.

13         So now even if you're -- like you get

14   an associate's degree and you're receiving

15   this TAP award for your associate's degree,

16   you're still paying more just because you

17   went to a comprehensive school rather than

18   going to a community college.

19         And I think when it gets into the tit

20   for tat city versus state, who's going to put

21   in what for what, I think that like the

22   students are at the fray of all this.    And we

23   heard from an international student who is

24   battling home insecurities right now.    And
                                                          420

 1   you would think because she pays triple

 2   she'll get triple the education, but she's

 3   dealing with the same problems that we are.

 4   You know?

 5         So I think it's really sad and

 6   disheartening that, you know, we have to deal

 7   with this.   Because if you ask any other

 8   administrator from CUNY or SUNY or from

 9   anywhere, straight up, they're like, Oh,

10   well, you know, there's this percentage and

11   this percentage.   But it's real people, and I

12   think that's what we need to look at in the

13   State Legislature.

14         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Are there

15   other -- it's not just tuition, because

16   there's also fees.

17         MR. HUNTER:    Yes.

18         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Which are the

19   most difficult fees to justify from your

20   point of view?

21         MR. HUNTER:    I think --

22         MS. PIQUANT:    Fees?   I think all fees

23   are a little ridiculous for us to justify.       I

24   just want to put it on the record, for the
                                                        421

 1   mental health fee, we students are not here

 2   for it.    Why do we have to pay for mental

 3   health services or health and wellness or

 4   whatever that becomes, and it takes six

 5   months on some campuses to see a counselor?

 6   Is that really seeing a counselor?     I mean,

 7   these are human beings that we're dealing

 8   with.    We are real people.

 9            You know, we have a student like my

10   colleague, she was battling home insecurity

11   and she had to spend her whole winter break

12   trying to figure out where she's going to put

13   a roof over her head.     But she's still here

14   today.    So --

15            MR. HUNTER:   I think that -- like just

16   piggybacking off what the vice chair of

17   legislative affairs, Juvanie Piquant, had

18   stated, the health and wellness fee is

19   something that kind of caught us off guard as

20   students because, you know, you're coming in

21   thinking okay, we're going to fight tuition

22   hikes, we're going to try to get this money

23   for the TAP gap, and then out of left field

24   you're seeing this health and wellness fee.
                                                        422

 1   Because we spent the whole of the year prior

 2   talking about the lack of mental health

 3   services on our campuses, so it's like, Oh,

 4   wait, so we talk about it so you can shift it

 5   on us to pay it?

 6            And I think that right now we're still

 7   waiting for -- because if you look at CUNY's

 8   budget proposal, the breakdown isn't really

 9   there.    So like, you know, it's kind of

10   interesting, you know, like -- just like

11   three or four sentences on the health and

12   wellness fee.    So the board and everybody is

13   still kind of waiting for those documents.

14   I've got a chance to look at some.    But, you

15   know, we're still working on whatever that

16   is.

17            But I think that it just shows that

18   the state disinvestment is too -- it's too

19   like -- it's just so distant, you know?     Even

20   with the telecounseling, I know that there's

21   been cuts to that at the SUNY side too, which

22   is truly disappointing.    You know, because

23   it's like you're going to try to shift it

24   onto students and if enrollment declines,
                                                         423

 1   that means that we're going to lose a

 2   guidance counselor?     Like -- like, you know,

 3   I think that it just doesn't make sense,

 4   especially for our smaller schools.      I wonder

 5   how that's going to help them, you know.

 6         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Thank you.

 7   Thank you very much, A, for being here

 8   waiting all day and for the fact that you're,

 9   you know, still working hard to get through

10   school.     And I appreciate that.

11         MR. HUNTER:     Thank you so much,

12   Assemblymember Glick.

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Senator Toby

14   Stavisky.

15         SENATOR STAVISKY:     We've spent a lot

16   of time together.    I said earlier, I don't

17   know if you were here, that the Higher Ed

18   Committee in the Senate held hearings

19   throughout the state, from Buffalo to

20   Nassau County, and without question the

21   students were the stars of the testimony that

22   we received.    And Tim and our -- his

23   colleagues and I have discussed many of these

24   issues, and I thank you.
                                                       424

 1         I also asked about the fees, because I

 2   thought they were a little bit unfair.

 3         Is there anything you want to add to

 4   your testimony?   Because I really appreciate

 5   your coming not only here, but also to the EI

 6   hearings and for your work as student

 7   government leaders.

 8         MR. HUNTER:     There are some -- oh, I'm

 9   sorry, you get to go first.

10         MS. AGU:    So as an international

11   student, it's very obvious that we are not

12   eligible for any of the financial assistance

13   that CUNY offers to their students, like TAP,

14   ASAP, financial aid and all that.   So -- and

15   even scholarship opportunities are very,

16   very -- stressing the "very" -- limited for

17   international students, because even students

18   who receive scholarship opportunities, they

19   still pay half of their tuition or more than

20   half of their tuition.

21         So I'm in this position as a vice

22   chair representing all international students

23   because I was once an international student

24   peer advisor, and I counseled international
                                                      425

 1   students like myself, and I heard their own

 2   stories.   And it's -- like Tim said, it's sad

 3   that the financial pressure is just so much

 4   on the students that sometimes the option is

 5   to drop out.   And I feel like if we were to

 6   come in terms with, you know, ideas and

 7   strategic plans in order to close this gap,

 8   which you've mentioned time without number

 9   that it can't happen in a year, that would

10   help international students to, you know,

11   plan strategically for their projected

12   tuition budget, and would also provide more

13   scholarship opportunities for them.

14         MR. HUNTER:   I think that, you know,

15   in addition to what Nicole has said, there's

16   two things that I definitely want to

17   highlight for like, I guess, the State

18   Legislature.   Number one being that the

19   DREAM Act, even though I think it was a

20   really great program, I think that there's

21   still some kinks to work out in terms of like

22   transparency of information.

23         But our student leaders on campuses,

24   some of these student leaders are Dreamers as
                                                        426

 1   well, and they're undocumented students.     But

 2   because they're undocumented, they're not

 3   eligible for some of the stipends from the

 4   student activity fee, because I think they're

 5   treated as tax-levy dollars.

 6         So I think that this is -- I think my

 7   predecessors have tried to get it into the

 8   DREAM Act in terms of allowing Dreamers to

 9   have access to a stipend.    Because what we're

10   doing is we're saying, hey, listen, you're

11   going to pay this fee but you're not going to

12   be able to benefit if you serve as a student

13   leader.

14         And I know that on this panel we have

15   some former student leaders as well.    And I

16   think that sometimes a small compensation can

17   help with paying tuition if you're in that,

18   what is it, like 25 percent of like students

19   that get rejected by HESC.    You know, I think

20   that like if you're in that group, I think

21   the least that we can do is provide you with

22   some sort of stipend.

23         There's actually a predecessor that

24   served in this position as a student trustee
                                                       427

 1   that did not get paid at all.   And I think

 2   that like it's kind of disappointing that

 3   someone's out here putting their life on the

 4   line for students, traveling to Albany every

 5   other week, talking with so many elected

 6   officials.   And for you to just not have any

 7   means, you know, I think that's something

 8   that's a stand-alone bill that I'm pretty

 9   sure right here we can probably pass.     But I

10   think that's something to consider.

11         The second thing that I would take a

12   look at is those portables at Medgar Evers

13   College.   I'm pretty sure like, again,

14   Senator Stavisky had asked the chancellor

15   about it and kind of got a little tap-dance

16   about it or whatever the case is.     But I

17   think that for us -- my mom attended

18   Medgar Evers College in 1993.   She had class

19   in those portables.   Students are still

20   taking classes in those portables, those same

21   ones that my mom attended.   Right?    And then

22   she went to New Paltz afterwards.     Right?

23         So I think that like seeing that, you

24   know, like it's just, to me -- again, it's
                                                          428

 1   a -- it's an equity issue.      If we're going to

 2   be equitable across the board, you know, I

 3   think that this is something that we need to

 4   take a real serious look at, which students

 5   aren't getting their end of the deal.

 6            SENATOR STAVISKY:   And your mother, I

 7   can assure you, is very proud of you.        I say

 8   that as a mother.

 9            MR. HUNTER:   I'm proud to be her son.

10            SENATOR STAVISKY:   Okay, thank you.

11            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.

12            Assembly?

13            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   Assemblymember

14   Epstein, to be followed by Assemblymember

15   Smith.

16            ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   I also want to

17   really thank you for everything you're doing.

18   And obviously we all need to work harder to

19   ensure that public education is available for

20   people.    And to see, you know, doubling of

21   tuition over a 15-year or 20-year period is

22   outrageous.

23            And so I guess one is -- I just want

24   to be clear, your position is no tuition
                                                         429

 1   increase or no tuition increase without a TAP

 2   increase?    Which is your general position?

 3           MR. HUNTER:    Free CUNY.   Okay, I think

 4   that --

 5           (Laughter.)

 6           MR. HUNTER:    -- what we need to do is

 7   --

 8           MS. PIQUANT:    No, free CUNY.   Free

 9   CUNY.   It's coming soon.

10           (Laughter.)

11           MR. HUNTER:    I think that what we

12   should definitely take a look at is

13   freezing -- I think that -- actually it was

14   Thomas DiNapoli I think said it yesterday at

15   NYSUT, he said it shouldn't be education or

16   healthcare, it should be both.

17           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Right.

18           MR. HUNTER:    Right?   And I think the

19   same thing applies to tuition increases and

20   TAP.    It shouldn't be like a tuition increase

21   or TAP reform, it should be both.     We should

22   try to freeze tuition and do that.

23           And I think another thing to

24   highlight, just to echo Senator Stavisky's
                                                       430

 1   standpoint, if we decide that, okay, let's

 2   get some money for a TAP gap, let's fill the

 3   TAP gap together -- great.     Tuition -- if

 4   that hike gets approved by the board, we're

 5   right back where we started.    You know?

 6   Let's say you fill that gap but it's not

 7   enough to cover the TAP gap for the following

 8   year.   Basically what we're doing is just

 9   playing the game of catch-up, and we'll just

10   always have a deficit.

11           So if you don't put enough to offset

12   the upcoming year tuition increases, or --

13   which I suggest -- put 36 million up front

14   and freeze tuition and then start trying to

15   fund the TAP gap separately, you know, I

16   think that makes more sense.    You don't run a

17   business by just saying like, okay, well, I'm

18   not going to take in like, you know, any

19   revenue and somehow save crumbling

20   infrastructure.   You want to be able to get

21   the state to put in that money in

22   substitute of the backs of the students that

23   made --

24           ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:   Timothy, I'm
                                                       431

 1   almost out of time, so I don't know if

 2   someone else wants to -- we all have time

 3   limitations.   I don't know if anyone else

 4   wants to add to it.

 5         And I know we wanted to -- so all

 6   fees, all additional fees.    You know, mental

 7   health fees, book, the additional fees -- we

 8   feel like we should be eliminating those,

 9   that people should be able to go to school

10   and tuition through TAP should cover all

11   expenses.   Is that everyone's position --

12         MR. HUNTER:     Yes.

13         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:     -- that we

14   should have no additional fees?

15         MS. PIQUANT:     And ultimately moving

16   towards a strategic planning of how we can go

17   back to free and fully funded CUNY.

18         ASSEMBLYMAN EPSTEIN:    Great.   And then

19   you can start -- support my legislation to

20   allow tuition-free education.

21         And so just one last thing, because I

22   know we talked a lot about mental health

23   issues and a lot of students who are

24   struggling with mental health.    Can you on
                                                     432

 1   the ground just tell us what you're hearing

 2   from students around lack of access to mental

 3   health providers and what impact that might

 4   be having on students?

 5           MS. AGU:   Well, students whom I've

 6   told about this mental health increase in the

 7   tuition, they think that it's very

 8   unnecessary because even -- even -- it has

 9   already been implemented, there is already an

10   increase in the tuition.   The Board of

11   Trustees have approved it.

12           But the thing is that they keep

13   increasing the fees, but the resources are

14   still going to be stagnant, and we all know

15   that.   There will be more understaffed, you

16   know, mental health counsel offices, there

17   will be more long waiting hours to see a

18   counselor.   So I feel like nothing will

19   actually change, even with this increase.

20   That is why they deem it to be very

21   unnecessary, every student that I've talked

22   to.   No one has supported this fee as far as

23   I've mentioned it.

24           MR. HUNTER:   And lastly, it doesn't
                                                     433

 1   come out of TAP.   You know, it would have to

 2   come out of your Pell grants or any other

 3   grants that you get.    So if you thought you

 4   were going to use your money to get books,

 5   it's going towards something that we still

 6   have yet to see.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And moving to

 8   Assemblymember Smith.

 9         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:    Thank you.

10         So my question is quick.    If you had

11   an additional three minutes to speak to us,

12   what would you say, in closing?

13         (Laughter.)

14         MS. AGU:     Okay, so I took this

15   position as vice chair to represent

16   international students, like I said, and

17   there is one thing that resonated to me was

18   international students in CUNY -- we all

19   fight for all students in CUNY and SUNY, but

20   I feel like sometimes we, you know, forget

21   the other small percentage of students which

22   are international students, and so we don't

23   really consider them when we're trying to

24   like talk about budgets and, you know, the
                                                     434

 1   rest of it that benefits other students.

 2         So that is why I had to show up today,

 3   to, you know, appeal to every one of you that

 4   whenever you're making decisions for CUNY or

 5   SUNY, please include international students

 6   in your plan, because we are still students

 7   in the City University of New York.

 8         MS. PIQUANT:   I have one minute, but I

 9   would like to get a little bit personal.

10   Without CUNY I wouldn't be where I am today.

11   To serve as the vice chair of legislative

12   affairs and to represent 500,000 students is

13   really an honor, especially as a young woman

14   of color.   My parents are immigrants.   My

15   father was an adjunct at Brooklyn College.

16   Without CUNY I would not be here today, and I

17   hold education dearly to my heart.

18         And I would like you to think about

19   all the CUNY students, the CUNY students who

20   are at Medgar, you know, in trailers taking

21   classes, the students who are sleeping on

22   campuses, the students who are food insecure.

23   Just think long and hard when things come

24   across your desk.   That's all I have to say.
                                                     435

 1   And you'll be seeing us much more very soon.

 2         MR. HUNTER:   Assemblymember Smith, I

 3   appreciate you giving us the extra time to

 4   just even like voice some of our concerns.

 5         I think one of the easy wins this

 6   year, definitely the DREAM Act, like whatever

 7   that is in terms of helping those students to

 8   get that like additional funding.   I have

 9   friends that are undocumented that are

10   student leaders that I don't -- I don't --

11   like I don't know how they're going to be

12   able to get through the semester without some

13   sort of additional help.

14         And I think that, you know, as we look

15   at, again, those trailers, looking at our

16   students, the morale is really low.   So it's

17   really hard to get students like organized.

18   And if we can come away with some sort of

19   win, this is the second year on like a real

20   trailblazing front for the State Legislature.

21         And I think that the last thing I

22   would say is that ASAP -- well, two last

23   things.   The ASAP program that got cut,

24   please don't let -- don't put politics over
                                                       436

 1   people.    Please let's advocate for ASAP to

 2   get back in the budget before the end of the

 3   budget session.

 4            And lastly, this TAP gap thing, it's

 5   affecting more people than we know.      And I

 6   think it's important that we take a real,

 7   real close look at it and put the pressure on

 8   HESC, put the pressure on the chancellor --

 9   he's on both sides -- and figure out what we

10   can do to help the students in New York

11   State.    Because pretty much everyone here has

12   benefited from public higher education.

13            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you all

14   very much for being with us today --

15            MR. HUNTER:    Thank you.

16            MS. AGU:   Thank you.

17            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     -- and for

18   missing your classes.      But they'll give you

19   credit for this.

20            MS. PIQUANT:    Thank you.

21            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Or we'll give

22   you credit.

23            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     We'll give you

24   credit.
                                                         437

 1           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     So next we have

 2   the State University of New York Student

 3   Assembly:    Austin Ostro, trustee, president

 4   of the SUNY Student Assembly; and Bryce Mac,

 5   Student Assembly treasurer.      And two other

 6   people.     Is one of you Brad Hershenson?

 7           MR. HERSHENSON:   Yes.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Takeena --

 9   well, just introduce the other people.       I

10   believe Austin and Bryce are the two who will

11   be --

12           MR. OSTRO:    Absolutely.

13           So thank you so much for inviting us

14   to be a part of this important day.     My name

15   is Austin Ostro.     I am a graduate student at

16   the University at Albany and the president of

17   the SUNY Student Assembly, which represents

18   the 1.4 million full- and part-time students

19   across 64 SUNY campuses.

20           I'm joined on my left by Bryce Mac,

21   who's our Student Assembly treasurer and a

22   student at SUNY New Paltz; to my right by

23   Takeena Strachan, who is the student

24   government president at SUNY Oswego; and
                                                      438

 1   further to my right, Brad Hershenson, who is

 2   our director of legislative affairs.

 3         So we, as the SUNY Student Assembly,

 4   are charged with representing all of those

 5   voices.   And given the charged political

 6   environment we all exist in, those voices

 7   have been louder than ever.

 8         Higher education has been thrust into

 9   the national policy spotlight like never

10   before.   Every major Democratic candidate for

11   president has some sort of plan to offer at

12   least partial free tuition for public higher

13   education.   And I think students are tapping

14   into that national enthusiasm for investment

15   in higher ed in ways that we've never seen

16   before, and that's juicing our advocacy like

17   never before.

18         But what I think is lost in that

19   national conversation about higher ed,

20   particularly about public higher ed, is that

21   it's not just about affordability.   An

22   affordable degree is great, but a degree is

23   only worth as much as the education that

24   degree provides you and the skills you leave
                                                      439

 1   with that -- that you gain over the course of

 2   your education.   And in order to get a

 3   high-quality education, in order to make that

 4   degree mean and be worth something, New York

 5   State needs to invest in the academic success

 6   of students.

 7          And the Student Assembly has

 8   identified a number of key funding priorities

 9   for this budget cycle where we believe the

10   state's investment could help enhance the

11   student experience, enhance the academic

12   success of students, and continue to build on

13   the promise of a SUNY education for all.

14          And my colleagues will hit on some of

15   those key priorities.   Bryce?

16          MR. MAC:   Before I begin, I would like

17   to thank the entire panel for letting me come

18   here today and speak.

19          Like Austin said, my name is Bryce

20   Mac.   I'm a student at SUNY New Paltz with

21   the hopes of one day running for public

22   office.   So I hope to be where you are today.

23          But one of our key advocacy points is

24   the reform of the community college funding
                                                        440

 1   model.     Community colleges in New York State

 2   are funded one part by the state, one part by

 3   the county, and one part by the students.

 4   However, for the past several years, students

 5   have had to hold the burden of increases in

 6   tuition and fees when it's the state's

 7   investment that is needed.

 8            This is something that needs to be

 9   addressed, and soon.    If it isn't, students,

10   faculty and staff will suffer tremendously.

11            Community colleges are a hidden gem,

12   not only in this state but across the

13   country.     They are the foundation for many

14   students, including myself.     However, if the

15   state doesn't increase their investment,

16   these schools both in SUNY and CUNY won't be

17   able to uphold the messages they were founded

18   on.

19            This past summer, my family and I had

20   to go through one of the hardest situations

21   in New York State -- homelessness.     My family

22   and I were homeless.    And during those rough

23   months, we had to choose between living on

24   the streets or living in a hotel.    My
                                                        441

 1   grandmother is a stroke victim, and I am a

 2   Type I diabetic, so of course we had to

 3   choose the hotel.     But everybody knows hotels

 4   aren't cheap, so we exhausted all of our

 5   money.

 6            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Bryce, I'm

 7   sorry --

 8            MR. MAC:   Yes.

 9            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   -- can we just

10   stop the clock, and we'll put more time.

11            Can someone up there shut the door?

12   Because we're hearing the voices from the

13   hall come down and it's echoing, and we'd

14   like people to hear what you have to say.

15            MR. MAC:   Thank you.

16            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Why don't you

17   put the clock at three minutes, give you a

18   little extra time since we were having

19   difficulty hearing.    But we need you all to

20   follow the time.    Thank you.

21            MR. MAC:   Thank you so much.

22            As you know, hotels aren't cheap, so

23   my family exhausted all of our money.    I had

24   to make a Go Fund Me page to make sure we
                                                        442

 1   stayed in that hotel and we wouldn't end up

 2   on the streets.

 3            I remember walking up to my mother and

 4   asking her "Should I drop out of school and

 5   work full-time?" to help her pay for that

 6   hotel.    She said "Absolutely not."    She said

 7   I should continue to go to school and obtain

 8   my education.

 9            During these times, because we had no

10   money, we had to rely on my former school's

11   food pantry.    If it wasn't for that food

12   pantry, I wouldn't be sitting here today.

13            Also, since we couldn't afford food, I

14   couldn't afford any textbooks for the past

15   fall semester.    But I am blessed to say that

16   I finished all those fall courses with

17   straight As.

18            However, not every student can do

19   that.    I am one of the lucky ones.    I have a

20   great support system; I survived.      But the

21   reality is not every student can do that and,

22   sadly, I am not the only student who has been

23   homeless.    There will be other students who

24   has, is, or will be homeless in the future.

 1         If you do not properly fund higher

 2   education, schools both in SUNY and CUNY

 3   won't be able to uphold the messages they

 4   were founded on.   If you do not properly fund

 5   higher education, the youth of tomorrow will

 6   be at a standstill.   If you do not properly

 7   fund higher education, that same food pantry

 8   that saved my life won't be able to save

 9   another.   If you do not properly fund higher

10   education, dreams will die.

11         Please make sure higher education is

12   properly funded this legislative session.

13         MS. STRACHAN:   Good afternoon.    My

14   name is Takeena Strachan, and I represent the

15   thousands of students enrolled at SUNY

16   Oswego, as the Student Association president.

17         Today I will highlight a few of the

18   experiences of myself and my colleagues at

19   SUNY Oswego and speak upon the importance of

20   investing in higher education.

21         My institution successfully

22   administers a variety of student support

23   services and should be seen as a role model

24   for all institutions of higher education in
                                                     444

 1   the state.   The mental health services

 2   available to students at SUNY Oswego are

 3   imperative to students' success.   As a

 4   student myself, I know the Counseling Center

 5   does the best it can with the resources

 6   available and the limited staff employed.

 7         After hearing feedback of other

 8   students and witnessing the increase in

 9   mental health rates of young adults on my

10   campus and also nationwide, with the help of

11   the staff of our Counseling Center we are

12   working to provide more accommodating

13   resources to all students.   We anticipate

14   accomplishing more as the semester continues.

15         Just like other student campuses, we

16   are determined to strengthen the mental

17   health resources on our campus by pushing

18   towards telehealth counseling alternatives,

19   diversifying our counseling team, and

20   providing more opportunities for students to

21   educate themselves on mental health issues

22   that they might encounter either personally

23   or by association with a peer.

24         Additionally, all students have the
                                                      445

 1   ability to reap the benefits of SHOP, or

 2   Students Helping Oswego Peers.   SHOP is our

 3   student- and community-supported clothing and

 4   food pantry on campus.   Although this

 5   resource is a positive for all students, it

 6   is not accommodating for everyone.     To find

 7   that our students on my campus were

 8   struggling to access food and clothing

 9   encouraged myself and my colleagues, through

10   constructive discussions, to identify how we

11   would increase support to students in need.

12         Currently the Oswego Student

13   Association is looking to provide an

14   extension on our pantry's operating hours

15   and, in collaboration with the administration

16   of Oswego, to advocate for an increase in

17   public donations to increase our inventory.

18         Our campus has encouraged our school's

19   alumni association to give back and to help

20   end our campus-wide issues, but their

21   donations are not measuring up to the number

22   of students deciding to eat their first two

23   weeks of school or to purchase their books

24   for class.
                                                       446

 1         There is more work to be done now, as

 2   this is not just an issue on the campus of

 3   SUNY Oswego but an opportunity to invest in

 4   all institutions of higher education within

 5   the State of New York.

 6         Thank you.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 8         Brad, would you like a minute to say

 9   something?

10         MR. HERSHENSON:    Sure, thank you.

11         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     We'll do a

12   minute, sort of a family courtesy.

13         MR. HERSHENSON:    Good afternoon.     My

14   name is Brad Hershenson.    I am a student at

15   the University at Albany and the legislative

16   director for the Student Assembly.

17         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Move that

18   closer, or slide into it.

19         MR. HERSHENSON:    I'd like to touch

20   upon the importance of capital investments,

21   specifically the element of sustainability.

22         At SUNY we need infrastructure

23   investment.   One, because much of SUNY was

24   built decades ago, we need to make the
                                                      447

 1   appropriate upgrades.    A lot of SUNY is

 2   deteriorating at the same rate, and we need

 3   investment to make the upgrades to bring SUNY

 4   to where it can be.

 5         And two, we need investment in our

 6   communities.   We need buildings that properly

 7   use resources, electricity efficiently, water

 8   efficiently, to invest in geothermal heating,

 9   green roofs, solar and wind where

10   appropriate.   And what we can do with that

11   when we're demonstrating that on our

12   campuses, on our infrastructure, is we can

13   educate students and we can use the faculty,

14   students and staff on our campus to build the

15   new generation workforce that is going to

16   prioritize sustainable development.

17         I also want to mention that elements

18   of resiliency are demonstrated in our

19   communities when we do that.    A lot of our

20   campuses have stormwater management plans

21   that are in collaboration with the different

22   regions across New York, and 40 percent of

23   public infrastructure in New York is

24   accounted for by SUNY.   That's almost half of
                                                         448

 1   the public infrastructure across the state,

 2   is just the State University of New York

 3   alone.

 4            And when demonstrating those elements

 5   of resiliency, whether it's the natural

 6   landscape or the built environment or the

 7   public health benefits, we're talking about

 8   investment into our system.      And as President

 9   and Trustee Ostro has said time and time

10   again, investment in SUNY is investment in

11   New York.

12            And we bring elements of resiliency to

13   our community.    SUNY pays that back through

14   the property taxes, through our income taxes,

15   through the houses that our students, faculty

16   and staff buy.    Students and faculty and

17   staff from SUNY are likely to live in

18   New York, to stay in New York for decades,

19   and we pay that back, we pay that investment

20   back to New York.

21            ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you.

22            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you very

23   much, all of you, for being here.     It's good

24   to see that we have a future generation that
                                                      449

 1   will be taking our place eventually.

 2          Thank you.    Let me see if there are

 3   any questions.    Assemblywoman Glick?

 4          ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:   It's not so much

 5   a question except to thank you.   And, you

 6   know, we stay in constant contact about the

 7   issues.

 8          And, you know, I want to congratulate

 9   you.   There was never a term that I got

10   straight As, so to do that with all of the

11   challenges and barriers, I just want to take

12   the hat that I don't have on off to you.

13          And to say that, you know, the student

14   government from SUNY has been an incredibly

15   vibrant resource for us, and we hope we can

16   continue to do that and figure out how we can

17   reach out, within the community and beyond,

18   for alumni to step up and say -- as you say,

19   yes, you stay here, you pay taxes.    We want

20   the Governor to know that.    We need to get

21   people to communicate that directly -- not

22   through the students, but through folks

23   writing their own note, letter, email, phone

24   call, whatever.
                                                         450

 1           Thanks.

 2           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you.

 3           Alicia?    Alicia Hyndman.

 4           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:      Really quick,

 5   I just wanted to say I'm a SUNY New Paltz

 6   grad.   And I never planned to run for office,

 7   and you are planning to run for office, so

 8   let's keep in touch.

 9           (Laughter.)

10           MR. MAC:    Definitely.    Most

11   definitely.

12           And thank you, Chair Glick.

13           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:      I really --

14   the alumni association, a lot of us will be

15   up there in May.    I really hope we could

16   connect and be helpful to you.

17           MR. MAC:    I will love that.     Thank

18   you.

19           ASSEMBLYWOMAN HYNDMAN:      Thank you.

20           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Great.   Thank

21   you all for --

22           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:       Thank you all.

23           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:       -- for being

24   here.   Good luck in your studies.

 1         Next we have the Commission on

 2   Independent Colleges and Universities, Mary

 3   Beth Labate, president.

 4         MS. LABATE:   Good afternoon, everyone.

 5         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Good afternoon.

 6         MS. LABATE:   I thought we'd have the

 7   results of the Iowa caucus by now, but we

 8   don't, so I'm sorry, guys.

 9         (Laughter.)

10         MS. LABATE:   Good afternoon,

11   Chairpersons Krueger and Weinstein and

12   Higher Ed Chairpersons Glick and Stavisky.

13   Thank you for your leadership, your fortitude

14   during these hearings, and the opportunity

15   for me to share my thoughts with you and the

16   committee today.

17         I'm Mary Beth Labate, president of the

18   Commission on Independent Colleges and

19   Universities, representing more than a

20   hundred private, not-for-profit colleges and

21   universities and nearly 500,000 students

22   across the state.

23         New York State is home to the largest

24   independent sector of higher ed in the
                                                      452

 1   nation, educating 40 percent of the state's

 2   1.2 million students, including nearly

 3   300,000 New Yorkers, and playing a vital role

 4   in our state's diverse higher education

 5   ecosystem.

 6         Few other states rely so heavily on

 7   its private, not-for-profit colleges to

 8   confer degrees and fulfill dreams, yet

 9   New York ranks 17th in the nation in its

10   per-capita, needs-based support for students

11   at private, not-for-profit colleges.

12         New York's independent sector is also

13   an integral part of the statewide economy,

14   responsible for more than 415,000 jobs across

15   the state and nearly $90 billion in economic

16   impact.   For centuries we have embraced the

17   call to educate students of every background

18   while bringing jobs, talent and energy to

19   communities across the state from Long Island

20   to Buffalo.   Those of you with campuses in or

21   near your districts know that better than

22   anyone.

23         Our students represent -- let me tell

24   you a little about our students.   Our
                                                     453

 1   students represent the diversity of our

 2   state.    Almost 50 percent of all

 3   African-American and Latinx students who

 4   receive a bachelor's or graduate degree earn

 5   them at a not-for-profit college.    Our

 6   students represent every income level.

 7   Two-thirds of our New York students are from

 8   families that earn less than $125,000

 9   annually.    Our students have higher

10   graduation rates and lower loan-default rates

11   than any other higher education sector in the

12   state.

13            Eighty-five percent of our students

14   benefit from financial aid directly from our

15   schools, bringing the average net price to

16   attend one of our schools down to $26,888.

17   Our students are making an investment in

18   themselves and their future, and our colleges

19   are with them every step of the way,

20   providing $6 billion in financial aid from

21   our own resources.

22            This year, as our state faces a

23   looming multi-billion-dollar deficit, it is

24   more important than ever that we target our
                                                      454

 1   resources towards students with the greatest

 2   need.   For this to happen, New York must

 3   increase support for the state's low- and

 4   moderate-income college students and restore

 5   funding for programs that allow

 6   not-for-profit colleges to remain a vital

 7   part of their communities and the higher

 8   education landscape.

 9           Our most important ask is for the

10   long-overdue expansion of the state's Tuition

11   Assistance Program, TAP, which will benefit

12   New York's neediest students regardless of

13   which college in New York they choose to

14   attend, and will help to close the TAP gap at

15   CUNY and SUNY.   For nearly 50 years, TAP has

16   helped students from New York's lowest-income

17   families realize their college dream.    Today

18   the program supports roughly 320,000

19   recipients, including 64,000 students for

20   whom a not-for-profit college is their

21   choice.

22           Unfortunately, in recent years TAP has

23   been helping fewer and fewer students, in

24   part because the income eligibility has not
                                                      455

 1   been adjusted in 20 years, and the size of

 2   the award has been adjusted only once in

 3   those same 20 years.   Today New York spends

 4   9 percent less -- $92 million less -- on TAP

 5   than it did in 2014-2015, and serves 49,000

 6   fewer students.

 7            Unless action is taken to expand TAP,

 8   this alarming decline is projected to

 9   continue.    In my testimony you'll see an

10   appendix that highlights this startling

11   trend.

12            While the proposed budget proposes to

13   expand the Excelsior Scholarship for

14   households who earn more than twice the

15   median income in New York, and three times

16   the median income of African-American and

17   Latinx households, I urge you instead to

18   focus on TAP, an equity-based solution to

19   college affordability that provides the most

20   support to families with lowest incomes and

21   the widest attainment gaps, and helps

22   students regardless of what college, public

23   or private, they attend.

24            Our colleges have almost doubled the
                                                     456

 1   amount of financial aid we provide over the

 2   past 10 years.   Now, New York State, we are

 3   asking you to do your part by increasing TAP

 4   over a three-year phase-in period as follows:

 5   Increase the minimum award to $1,000 from

 6   $500, the maximum award to $6,000 from

 7   $5,165, and the income eligibility ceiling to

 8   $110,000 from $80,000.   These actions will

 9   help the neediest students at SUNY, CUNY and

10   not-for-profit institutions.

11         In addition to TAP, Opportunity

12   Programs like HEOP can open the door to

13   higher education for many of the state's

14   neediest students.   We're grateful that the

15   Governor did not cut the programs, and we ask

16   them to be expanded.

17         Finally, I ask that you ensure that

18   our state's diverse higher education

19   ecosystem continues to thrive.   This can be

20   done by supporting a small increase in the

21   Bundy Aid, a $35 million program and the only

22   source of operating aid for not-for-profit

23   colleges.

24         We're also requesting that the
                                                       457

 1   $30 million be restored for the Higher

 2   Education Capital Assistance Matching Grant

 3   Program, or HECap.   Our schools provide a

 4   three-to-one match to HECap and pay

 5   prevailing wage on all work funded from the

 6   grant.

 7            The Governor has proposed a historic

 8   $175 billion state infrastructure plan,

 9   including $9 billion for SUNY and CUNY

10   infrastructure over the next six years, and

11   that is fantastic.   But in this context,

12   $30 million to support a sector that educates

13   40 percent of all students is a modest but

14   important investment.

15            In closing, I call on you to renew our

16   state's commitment to the higher education

17   landscape in New York that has for

18   generations been a hallmark of our greatness.

19   I look forward to working with you and your

20   legislative colleagues to ensure that low-

21   and moderate-income students are not

22   overlooked and that our campuses can remain

23   vibrant members of their communities.

24            Thanks, and I welcome any questions.

 1            CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 2            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Assemblyman

 3   Smith.

 4            ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:     Thank you.

 5            Can you expand a little bit on the

 6   Enhanced Tuition Awards?       Do you know offhand

 7   how many colleges are participating or what

 8   the --

 9            MS. LABATE:   There are a total of 38

10   colleges participating; 30 are not-for-profit

11   colleges.    It's been a little tough to get

12   data, but I believe there are about 2,000

13   recipients of the award and it's been about

14   an average award of something a little shy of

15   $2,000 per recipient.

16            ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:     Okay.   And then in

17   terms of the HECap, what are some of the

18   projects that right now the proposed

19   $30 million cut -- obviously that would

20   really make it a little bit harder to do some

21   of these capital improvements.       But can you

22   expand on some of the things that we're

23   looking to do this coming year?

24            MS. LABATE:   Sure.    It's a competitive
                                                       459

 1   process, so it really will be up to the

 2   colleges to put forward the capital projects

 3   that they want to move with.

 4         I can tell you in the past we've

 5   built -- we've helped to build buildings,

 6   HECap has helped to build buildings that have

 7   a focus on sustainability.     Sometimes it's

 8   helping to equip those buildings with the

 9   latest technology that is needed to, let's

10   say, serve in the nursing profession.     So

11   it's all over the board.

12         I know on Long Island there have been

13   several schools that have benefited from it,

14   and I'd be glad to get you a list of all the

15   Long Island schools that have been able to

16   leverage HECap.

17         ASSEMBLYMAN SMITH:     Thank you so much.

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Senate?

19         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Senator Toby

20   Stavisky.

21         SENATOR STAVISKY:    Yeah, real quick.

22         I know the colleges are just starting

23   the application process, I assume for the

24   2019 money, for the HECap money.
                                                       460

 1         MS. LABATE:    That's correct.

 2         SENATOR STAVISKY:     So I assume all of

 3   it -- none of it has been really expended.

 4         MS. LABATE:    Correct.

 5         SENATOR STAVISKY:     How would you

 6   improve Enhanced TAP?   In a minute.

 7         MS. LABATE:    I think there are a few

 8   things.    I think -- first and foremost, we --

 9   our preference is the TAP program.

10         SENATOR STAVISKY:     I know that.

11         MS. LABATE:    We think it's more

12   progressive, it focuses on all students.

13         On the Enhanced Tuition Awards

14   Program, I think there are a few issues that

15   we take -- have some concern with.     One is

16   it's not really the equivalent of Excelsior.

17   The maximum award that a student can receive

18   from the state is $3,000.    The maximum award

19   that a student under Excelsior can receive is

20   the full cost of SUNY tuition and CUNY

21   tuition.   We know that's infrequently the

22   case, but the fact is the award levels are

23   significantly different.    So that would be

24   one big change.
                                                      461

 1         I think the other thing that gives us

 2   pause is this requirement that you freeze

 3   tuition.   Because what that tells our schools

 4   is for the relatively few students who can

 5   get an Enhanced Tuition Award and who have

 6   their tuition frozen, someone needs to make

 7   that up somewhere, and that unfortunately is

 8   the majority of students who are not

 9   receiving an Enhanced TAP award.   And I think

10   that is really the same in the public

11   institutions as well.

12         SENATOR STAVISKY:   Thank you.

13         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Senator Jim

14   Seward.

15         SENATOR SEWARD:   Well, Mary Beth, it's

16   good to see you.

17         MS. LABATE:   Nice to see you, Senator.

18         SENATOR SEWARD:   You've already shared

19   with us the number of campuses that are

20   participating in the Enhanced Tuition Awards.

21   Can you share with us how many campuses that

22   are currently participating in that program

23   that actually may be setting limits on the

24   number of students that will receive an award
                                                        462

 1   due to having to provide that up to $3,000

 2   match?

 3            MS. LABATE:   That's a great -- I don't

 4   have that exact number.     I can get that for

 5   you.

 6            Several of them, though, because they

 7   do not -- I think they're concerned about the

 8   equity of having some students guaranteed

 9   their tuition frozen and others not.        And

10   often you might have a higher-income student

11   who is guaranteed their tuition is frozen and

12   a lower-income student who cannot benefit

13   from ETA who does not.

14            So I'll get you that information.

15            SENATOR SEWARD:   That would be

16   helpful.

17            And is the match the issue here?

18            MS. LABATE:   The match is not so --

19   the match is not the issue.     Our schools --

20   especially when the award is up to $3,000,

21   our schools are very generous in the amount

22   of financial aid they provide.     So our

23   schools have always put a lot of skin in the

24   game.    So the match is not the issue so much.
                                                      463

 1         SENATOR SEWARD:   Just for the record,

 2   I appreciated your comments in terms of

 3   increases in enhancement of the Tuition

 4   Assistance Program, the TAP award.   You know,

 5   my conference has been big supporters of that

 6   effort over the years and certainly share

 7   your goals there this year.

 8         One final question, and that is on

 9   Bundy Aid.   That has been kind of frozen for

10   many, many years.   Are you seeking an

11   increase in Bundy Aid this year?

12         MS. LABATE:   We are.   We're seeking a

13   small increase --

14         SENATOR SEWARD:   Could you give us a

15   number for that?

16         MS. LABATE:   We're seeking an increase

17   of 3 percent.   What we looked at was private

18   K-12 in New York State receives about

19   $200 million from the state every year, and

20   every year the amount of operating support to

21   private K-12 is increased equivalent with

22   school aid increase.   So this year school aid

23   is increased by 3 percent, private K-12 is

24   increased by 3 percent, we're suggesting
                                                          464

 1   Bundy Aid be increased by 3 percent.        It

 2   would amount to about $1.3 million.

 3          The statute itself on Bundy Aid --

 4   which is supposed to award money based on the

 5   number of degrees, so it's a

 6   degree-completion incentive -- if the statute

 7   were allowed to prevail, funding for

 8   Bundy Aid would be about $160 million.

 9          SENATOR SEWARD:   Great.    Well, just in

10   conclusion, not a question but a comment, we

11   spent a lot of time today talking about SUNY

12   and CUNY, and those are important, important

13   issues.   But I'm very pleased to have you

14   come forward because no question that the

15   independent sector in higher education serves

16   so many students in New York State, and very

17   often from lower-income levels as well.

18          MS. LABATE:   Absolutely.

19          SENATOR SEWARD:   And that's making a

20   tremendous contribution not only

21   educationally but economically, and we thank

22   you.

23          MS. LABATE:   Thank you.

24          CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.    Thank
                                                         465

 1   you for being here.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 3         MS. LABATE:     Thank you.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next we have

 5   Association of Proprietary Colleges:      Donna

 6   Stelling-Gurnett, president, Christopher

 7   Barto, vice president.

 8         And they'll be followed by On Point

 9   for College, to be followed by College &

10   Community Fellowship.

11         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     And while they

12   settle in, with 62 percent reporting, Iowa

13   seems to be in the following order:      Pete,

14   Bernie, Elizabeth, Joe.   More to come.

15         MS. STELLING-GURNETT:        All right.

16   Late-breaking news, that's great.      All right.

17         So Senator Stavisky, Senator Krueger,

18   members of the Legislature, thank you for

19   this opportunity to present this testimony on

20   behalf of the Association of Proprietary

21   Colleges.

22         My name is Donna Stelling-Gurnett.

23   I'm the president of the association.      And

24   I'm here today with Christopher Barto of
                                                      466

 1   LIM College.

 2         Christopher and I have had the

 3   opportunity to participate in this hearing in

 4   the past, and I know you've heard us talk

 5   about APC's 12 family-owned member colleges

 6   that are -- have very strong student outcomes

 7   and are really committed to educational

 8   excellence, access and affordability.

 9         Before I start our testimony today,

10   though, I'd like to start by just saying

11   thank you sincerely for your support and

12   leadership last year as you helped us push

13   back against the Governor's proposed

14   For-Profit College Accountability Act.     We

15   feel his proposal was misguided and

16   essentially would have closed an entire

17   sector of higher education here in New York.

18         As we moved through the budget process

19   last year, though, APC certainly learned a

20   few lessons.   We realized that there seems to

21   be a lack of understanding of the current

22   regulations that are already in existence,

23   perhaps a lack of understanding about what

24   data is already available, and probably most
                                                      467

 1   importantly, what does it mean to truly be a

 2   family-owned institution, and how are they

 3   different than the large publicly traded

 4   for-profit colleges that you may hear about

 5   at the federal level.

 6         So as we were heading into this

 7   legislative session, we took a look at what

 8   we have available on our website.   We have a

 9   very robust facts and figures page, but we

10   also added a new section to our website where

11   you can now see individual member profiles

12   for each and every APC member.   So you can

13   click on that link and you can find out

14   information about what family owns that

15   institution, what year were they founded, who

16   are they accredited by.   We provide a link to

17   their college scorecard page so you can get

18   an understanding of their outcomes.   And we

19   also provide a student demographic section so

20   you can see what types of students are

21   attending that institution.   And there's also

22   a financial section so you can see what that

23   college's 90/10 ratio is, what their fiscal

24   composite score is, what their cohort default
                                                       468

 1   rate is.

 2         And our hope is that having all of

 3   this information will help foster a more

 4   constructive dialogue as we move through this

 5   legislative session.

 6         So before I turn it over to

 7   Christopher to talk about some of our

 8   recommendations, I would just ask that you

 9   use the association as a resource as we go

10   through this session.

11         So Christopher?

12         MR. BARTO:    Thank you, Donna.   Members

13   of the Legislature, thank you for the

14   opportunity to join my colleague in

15   testifying today.

16         I'd like to speak about continued

17   support for expanding TAP.   TAP has served as

18   the cornerstone of New York State's financial

19   aid program, providing financial support to

20   help ensure that thousands of students

21   complete their degrees in a timely manner

22   every year.

23         APC member colleges share the state's

24   commitment to keeping college affordable.    In
                                                       469

 1   2018, the average tuition at APC member

 2   colleges increased less than 1 percent over

 3   the previous year, and in 2017 APC member

 4   colleges provided over 95 million in

 5   institutional grants and scholarships, more

 6   than double the amount of TAP funds received

 7   by all New York State proprietary colleges.

 8         Together, institutional support and

 9   TAP funding provides significant

10   life-changing opportunities for students

11   attending APC member colleges.     Further, APC

12   member colleges focus on ensuring that

13   students progress towards their degrees while

14   graduating on time, which helps to keep their

15   student loan debt as low as possible.

16         APC respectfully requests your

17   consideration for the following enhancements

18   to the TAP program.

19         Increase funding, actually, for one of

20   the ancillary programs, the Enhanced Tuition

21   Award program.   The ETA program is the

22   private institutional counterpart, as we

23   know, to Governor Cuomo's signature Excelsior

24   program.   The Governor has proposed
                                                      470

 1   increasing the maximum income eligibility

 2   threshold to $150,000 for both programs.

 3   While we appreciate the Governor's proposal

 4   to support a greater range of students, we

 5   also encourage lawmakers to increase the

 6   overall funding for the ETA program.

 7         We join with many of our other

 8   colleagues who have testified today in

 9   pushing for increased funding for the TAP

10   program.   We feel that the TAP program is

11   currently constrained in fulfilling its

12   promise to students.   We should be increasing

13   the number of students served under the

14   program, yet the Governor has proposed a

15   $60 million reduction in the program funding.

16         Increase the minimum TAP award to

17   $1,000, increase the maximum TAP award up to

18   $6,000.    As has been noted today, the TAP

19   maximum has not appreciably increased in over

20   20 years, yet cost-of-living increases during

21   that time have gone up almost 50 percent.

22         We also would support increasing the

23   maximum net taxable income for TAP

24   eligibility to $110,000 and restoring maximum
                                                     471

 1   TAP awards for two-year degree programs.

 2         Investments in TAP are well

 3   established and proven investments in the

 4   future vitality of New York's workforce and

 5   the economic development of local communities

 6   around the state.   Let's continue to ensure

 7   the efficacy of the TAP program in supporting

 8   New York's neediest students across all four

 9   sectors of higher education.

10         Thank you.

11         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

12         To Assemblymember Glick.

13         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     I see that

14   you've chosen to highlight some of your

15   student veterans, and I'm just wondering, is

16   there -- what's the percentage of veterans

17   that attend the proprietary colleges?

18         MS. STELLING-GURNETT:     It's actually

19   relatively small, honestly.

20         So we serve approximately 27,000

21   students in our 12 APC member colleges; less

22   than 700 of them are veterans that are using

23   GI benefits.   So maybe 2 percent, I think.

24         ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Did you say
                                                           472

 1   27,000 students?

 2           MS. STELLING-GURNETT:     Mm-hmm.

 3           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     And roughly

 4   around 700 are --

 5           MS. STELLING-GURNETT:     Yes.

 6           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    The graduation

 7   rate?

 8           MS. STELLING-GURNETT:     For those GI --

 9           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    For -- on

10   average, your general graduation rate across

11   the 12 colleges.

12           MS. STELLING-GURNETT:     A good

13   question, actually.   Let me just take a quick

14   peek at our testimony.

15           On our last page of the testimony we

16   give -- our on-time associate degree

17   graduation rate is 29 percent.

18           MR. BARTO:   And bachelor-degree

19   graduation rates are higher than that.        I can

20   share that at LIM College our graduation rate

21   is 54 percent.

22           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:    Thank you.

23           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

24           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.
                                                       473

 1   Thank you for being here today.      Thank you.

 2            MS. STELLING-GURNETT:   Thank you.

 3            CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:   Next we will

 4   hear from On Point for College, Samuel Rowser

 5   and Kevin Marken, then College & Community

 6   Fellowship, followed by the Hispanic

 7   Federation.

 8            MR. ROWSER:   Good evening.   I'd just

 9   like to thank Chairperson Stavisky on her way

10   out and Assemblyperson Weinstein and

11   Assemblyperson Glick for this opportunity,

12   the budget hearing on higher education, for

13   allowing us this opportunity to share.

14            My name is Samuel Rowser.     I'm the

15   executive director for On Point for College,

16   and with me is our Utica director, Kevin

17   Marken.    Not with us today are our partners

18   from New York City, Goddard Riverside Options

19   Program and New Settlement Apartments in the

20   Bronx.

21            I just want to thank you for this

22   opportunity to talk with you about investing

23   a million dollars in New York's future

24   workforce.    Since On Point for College was
                                                     474

 1   founded in 1999, we've helped more than

 2   2700 students actually graduate from college.

 3   Over the course of their working lifetime,

 4   they'll earn over a billion dollars, which

 5   will be spent in their communities.

 6         About a year ago we did an assessment

 7   in Utica of the number of individuals that

 8   graduated that year, how many came back to

 9   the community, and it was 93 percent of those

10   students came back to the community that they

11   graduated from.

12         Right now we're serving in Onondaga,

13   Madison, Cayuga, Cortland, Oswego, Oneida and

14   Herkimer Counties, and also with our partners

15   in Manhattan and the Bronx.

16         On Point provides college access,

17   college success and career services to help

18   young adults ages 17 to 29 to apply to,

19   enroll in, and persist at college through

20   graduation, while building skills and

21   pre-professional experiences to help launch

22   their careers.

23         On Point is unique in the nation for

24   the holistic approach we take to helping
                                                       475

 1   students.    Earlier you heard many of the

 2   students talk about a lot of the issues that

 3   they were having on the campuses and they

 4   have going through the process of education,

 5   and there are just a couple of things I

 6   really want to highlight.

 7            On Point takes hundreds of students

 8   each year to visit colleges all over

 9   New York -- over 70 colleges throughout the

10   state.    In New York State we use a corps of

11   dedicated volunteers or bus tickets to help

12   students get to and from campus.    On Point

13   also partners with two dentists.    Someone

14   asked the question earlier, do you have to

15   have healthcare?    Most colleges require you

16   have healthcare, but not dental.    So what

17   happens if you get a toothache and you're

18   low-income?    We have dentists that we go pick

19   you up, bring you home, fix your teeth, take

20   you back to college.    Lose your eyeglasses,

21   we get you an eyeglass exam and two pair of

22   glasses.

23            On Point even partners with local

24   colleges and we have housing at a private
                                                      476

 1   college, Le Moyne College in Syracuse.    For

 2   15 years, any students that are

 3   housing-challenged have the opportunity to

 4   stay on campus the entire summer semester,

 5   free of charge.   And during the winter breaks

 6   we have an organization that they own

 7   apartments and they allow us to use their

 8   apartments over the short breaks for students

 9   to stay who are housing-challenged.

10         We also help students pay for

11   textbooks, summer courses, outstanding bills

12   that prevent them from re-enrolling, housing

13   deposits and fees, when financial aid is

14   unavailable or has run out.

15         We just want to say that an investment

16   in On Point is also an investment in

17   New York's higher education institutions.

18   Seventy percent or more of our 2400 students

19   that are enrolled now, we're serving this

20   semester, attend public colleges across

21   New York State.   That's about 23 million --

22   over $23 million in tuition and fees and room

23   and board at the community college, CUNY,

24   SUNY system as well as some of the private
                                                       477

 1   schools.

 2           We have a great deal of experience in

 3   helping students navigate the system.      On

 4   Point's advisers, we actually go to the

 5   campus and visit the students frequently

 6   throughout the year.    At the community

 7   colleges we're there once a month.    Our local

 8   colleges, we're there a couple of times a

 9   week.

10           On Point students persist at a higher

11   rate -- 77 percent higher than the average at

12   the community colleges, which is 60 percent.

13   Our students bring TAP, Pell awards as well

14   as student loan dollars to the campuses, and

15   our generous donors help us to support these

16   students.

17           If it had not been for On Point, many

18   of our students would not be attending

19   college.    So we believe that providing the

20   $1 million in state funding for On Point's

21   program will have an impact on thousands of

22   low-income first-generation students each

23   year, helping people consider going to

24   college who might otherwise not have thought
                                                      478

 1   college was possible and providing wraparound

 2   services to support students on every step of

 3   their journey toward their degrees.

 4          Investments in these young people will

 5   immediately support colleges across the state

 6   and will bring long-term fruit as our

 7   graduates bring their degrees and skills to

 8   the state's workforce.

 9          I just want to thank the members of

10   the Higher Education Committee for this

11   wonderful opportunity to share this

12   information with you.    And at the end of the

13   day, we ask everyone to keep it On Point.

14          Thank you.

15          CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

16   Thank you for your testimony today.   Thank

17   you.

18          So next we have College & Community

19   Fellowship, followed by Hispanic Federation,

20   followed by Police Benevolent Association of

21   New York State, followed by SUNY student

22   Mac-Olivier Lalanne.    So people, if I called

23   your organization, your name, you should make

24   your way to the -- you should make your way
                                                         479

 1   down.   Thank you.

 2           MS. GILESTRA:   Hello.     Thank you for

 3   the opportunity to speak today and provide

 4   testimony.

 5           ASSEMBLYWOMAN GLICK:     Pull it close to

 6   you.    The acoustics are lousy.

 7           MS. GILESTRA:   Yes.     My name is

 8   Ivelisse Gilestra, and I am the community

 9   organizer for College & Community Fellowship.

10           And we have been providing services

11   for 20 years for formerly incarcerated women,

12   direct services, and helping them achieve a

13   college degree.    We also have noticed that in

14   the work that we do, we also approach many

15   barriers from a systemic level.

16           And I'm here to talk today about the

17   Turn on the TAP campaign that we are

18   launching, and we seek the passage of Bill

19   S790, championed by Montgomery, and A3975, by

20   Aubry, to restore the Tuition Assistance

21   Program, or TAP, for those incarcerated.

22           We have a broad collaboration of

23   partners in this work.   And just to give you

24   a little history that I'm pretty sure that
                                                      480

 1   you all know, TAP was operating successfully

 2   in New York State until 1995, a year after

 3   Pell Grants were banned at the federal level

 4   as well.

 5         So in the Executive Chamber Fiscal

 6   Year 2021 Budget Briefing Book it states that

 7   New York is leading the nation in expanding

 8   access to a quality and affordable college

 9   tuition.   But this is false, because Tuition

10   Assistance Program are not in New York for

11   people incarcerated.

12         There are 19 states that do provide

13   state financial assistance, but New York is

14   not one of them.    And this is people that

15   need it the most.    This is a population that

16   is usually excluded from conversation of

17   education.   And I want to talk a little bit

18   about predictors or factors that lead to

19   pathways to people to prison.

20         One of them is growing up in a

21   marginalized community, which is usually

22   characterized by low rates of education

23   attainment, criminalization of poverty.    We

24   have youth that drop out of high school,
                                                        481

 1   which makes them 47 percent more likely to

 2   end up in prison.   So we need to uplift these

 3   communities that need it the most.

 4         Access to higher education also

 5   produces a multigenerational effect,

 6   disrupting that intergenerational poverty.

 7   We have parents that partake in

 8   college-in-prison models and education

 9   inside, there's a likelihood their kids will

10   be motivated to do the same, even if their

11   parent is incarcerated.

12         So education usually provides better

13   employment, autonomy, which reduces the

14   reliance on government assistance, and upward

15   mobility.   So education provides a myriad of

16   benefits and has the potential, like I said

17   again, to uplift a community that has been

18   marginalized, excluded.   So restoring TAP in

19   general is just smart fiscal policy.     It is a

20   win-win.

21         In the Executive Budget for fiscal

22   year 2020 there was a proposed increase of

23   $154 million in higher ed.   But for less than

24   10 percent of this, and even less than
                                                       482

 1   2 percent of the total TAP, we can be

 2   providing that to people incarcerated, people

 3   behind bars that really, really will benefit

 4   from this.

 5            So since this is an entitlement

 6   program, this will not take from

 7   nontraditional students, which is something

 8   that we -- it's a myth that we need to

 9   debunk.    This does not take from non --

10   non-incarcerated students.

11            So this is an issue of educational

12   equity.    Since 1995, New York State has

13   removed access to this opportunity, an

14   opportunity that has proven not only as a

15   need, as a benefit to marginalized

16   communities -- I know personally the powerful

17   benefits of education as being

18   transformative.    I am a formerly incarcerated

19   woman.    While in prison, I used education as

20   a catalyst to that transformation.

21            And not only education gave me the

22   tools to navigate the many barriers that I

23   have encountered in transitioning back into

24   society, but it has equipped me -- it has
                                                       483

 1   really -- it has really built me in order to

 2   understand the factors that led me into

 3   prison.   So this has been transferred to my

 4   family and to my community.   People that

 5   obtain an education are very much involved

 6   with civic engagement, because you want to

 7   give back that gift that was given to you.

 8         So to me it is an urgent necessity.

 9   It affects mostly the people that are

10   disproportionately represented in prison,

11   which is black and brown communities.    So I

12   have seen, I have seen the effects of people

13   obtaining their education inside.    And I wish

14   we could restore TAP as it was before 1995.

15         I think everybody goes into prison

16   with already some trauma, but nobody leaves

17   unaffected.   So I think as a society we

18   benefit from people leaving out with an

19   education.

20         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

21   being a strong advocate and example for the

22   cause that you are advocating.

23         MS. GILESTRA:   Yes.

24         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:      Thank you for
                                                       484

 1   being here.    It's much appreciated.

 2         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 3         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 4         MS. GILESTRA:     Thank you for the

 5   opportunity.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Next, the

 7   Hispanic Federation, Diana Cruz, followed by

 8   Police Benevolent Association of New York,

 9   followed by Mac-Olivier Lalanne.

10         MS. CRUZ:    Thank you, Chairwoman

11   Krueger, Chairwoman Weinstein and other

12   committee members for taking the time to

13   listen to the testimony drafted by Hispanic

14   Federation.    I know it's been a long day, so

15   your presence and commitment is vital to the

16   support for us to move forward the policies

17   that we want to present.

18         The Hispanic Federation is a nonprofit

19   organization seeking to empower and advance

20   the Hispanic community's programs and

21   legislative advocacy.    My name is Diana Cruz,

22   and as the director of education policy for

23   the Hispanic Federation, I am here to

24   advocate for Latinx students in New York
                                                      485

 1   State struggling to attain a postsecondary

 2   degree.

 3         Currently New York State is failing to

 4   graduate Latinx students that are college and

 5   career ready.   From 2007 to 2017, in New York

 6   City, Latinx young adults ages 18 to 24 have

 7   increased their college enrollment by 9

 8   percent, from 29 percent to 38 percent.    In

 9   the same decade, the Latinx completion crisis

10   has risen from 13 percent to 23 percent,

11   demonstrating that the Latinx

12   non-completion rate is growing slightly

13   faster than the increase of college

14   enrollment.

15         In order to address this, the Hispanic

16   Federation strongly urges the Legislature to

17   include and prioritize the following budget

18   and legislative recommendations in their

19   one-house budgets.

20         Starting with the Senator Jose Peralta

21   New York State DREAM Act, the Hispanic

22   Federation asks the Legislature to secure the

23   same funding as last year of $27 million to

24   ensure undocumented students continue to have
                                                       486

 1   access to higher education.

 2         I know that we have heard from

 3   Dr. Linares earlier today, and he mentioned

 4   the number of students that have been

 5   applying to the DREAM Act.    But approximately

 6   146,000 young people are eligible for state

 7   financial aid through the DREAM Act.    It is

 8   our hope that as we develop more trust from

 9   the community, this opportunity will make

10   students want to utilize this new path to

11   receive financial aid.

12         However, it is important to

13   acknowledge that unfortunately the

14   undocumented and mixed-status families are

15   still fearful and have misconceptions about

16   what the DREAM Act entails.   Further, school

17   counselors and professionals are also

18   confused on how to best help their students.

19   HESC is using its resources to the best of

20   its ability and yet does not have the

21   capacity to create and implement a plan to

22   educate families and educators on the

23   New York State DREAM Act.

24         We strongly believe that HESC needs a
                                                      487

 1   minimum of $1 million to properly put the law

 2   into action and spearhead community outreach,

 3   along with CBOs to launch a statewide

 4   campaign to dispel misunderstandings about

 5   the New York State DREAM Act.

 6         Moreover, HESC alone cannot provide

 7   enough outreach to communities and high

 8   schools.   SUNY and CUNY must participate in

 9   increasing marketing and recruitment efforts

10   to assist new students in understanding the

11   DREAM Act.   We ask that SUNY and CUNY receive

12   $500,000 to increase outreach and recruitment

13   efforts.

14         When the Excelsior Scholarship came

15   into effect, SUNY made clear efforts in

16   marketing to assist new students in

17   understanding the Excelsior Scholarship.   It

18   even explored the use of Smart Track targeted

19   emails to assist scholarship recipients.

20   Further, SUNY distributed information about

21   the Excelsior Scholarship to more than 8,000

22   high school students at college fairs.

23         We insist that both institutions

24   provide intentional outreach to high school
                                                       488

 1   and college students to guarantee the right

 2   understanding to apply for the New York State

 3   DREAM Act.

 4         Additionally, as we have heard from a

 5   lot of other advocates here today,

 6   Opportunity Program funding has been proven

 7   to increase retention and graduation rates,

 8   especially for first-generation students.

 9   Many of those students are low-income

10   students of color that need additional

11   academic and financial supports to graduate

12   college.

13         These programs change generational

14   wealth disparities and in some cases set

15   students up to be the first ones in their

16   families to attain a college degree.    We urge

17   the legislation to allocate the necessary

18   funding to these programs, and you can find a

19   direct budget ask and recommendations in the

20   testimony provided.

21         Moving forward, the shift in student

22   demographics attending higher education

23   demands institutions to take a closer look at

24   developing resources and acknowledge how
                                                     489

 1   representation in their faculty and staff

 2   also matters.   Research studies consistently

 3   show that when students of color have faculty

 4   of color to learn from and lean on, the

 5   success of their educational outcomes

 6   increases dramatically.

 7         We strongly support the creation of

 8   the SUNY Office of Diversity and Educational

 9   Equity and urge $500,000 in funding to be

10   allocated to SUNY for this purpose.   This

11   office will be tasked with drafting a report

12   to the Governor and Legislature on diversity

13   efforts that must include enrollment from

14   underrepresented students, staff and faculty.

15         In summation, New York must continue

16   to fund the Senator Jose Peralta New York

17   State DREAM Act and invest in its

18   implementation, as well as ensure that HESC

19   and higher education institutions are

20   receiving enough funding to educate and

21   dispel misinformation to fearful undocumented

22   communities.

23         Additionally, Opportunity Programs are

24   specifically designed to benefit
                                                        490

 1   first-generation college students.      New York

 2   must increase the funding for these programs

 3   to end generational wealth inequities.

 4           Lastly, as we acknowledge that student

 5   demographics become more diverse, there is a

 6   high need of a center that specializes in

 7   capturing data that reinforces diversity and

 8   inclusion.

 9           I thank you for your time and

10   re-emphasize how critical it is to prioritize

11   this budget ask for the benefit of many

12   students, communities and the whole state.

13           Thank you.

14           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

15   Thank you for being here.

16           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you very

17   much.

18           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Next, the

19   Police Benevolent Association of New York

20   State, Ryan Law, PBA president and University

21   Police Officers director.

22           MR. LAW:     Good evening, respected

23   members of the joint committee.     My name is

24   Ryan Law, and I am the director of the
                                                     491

 1   University Police Officers and the current

 2   president of the Police Benevolent

 3   Association of New York State.

 4         The PBA of New York State is a law

 5   enforcement labor union representing

 6   approximately 1200 members of the bargaining

 7   unit representing the New York State

 8   University Police, New York State

 9   Environmental Conservation Police, New York

10   State Park Police, and New York State Forest

11   Rangers.

12         I submitted a lengthy written

13   testimony, but in the interests of time I

14   will speak on the highlighted areas here.

15         The four units of the PBA are

16   comprised of the second, third, fourth and

17   fifth largest units of police officers

18   employed in New York State.   The officers

19   live and work in your districts.    We are

20   keeping you, the students and staff of SUNY

21   campuses, the visitors of our parks and other

22   public lands, as well as New York State's

23   natural resources, safe.   We are all

24   extraordinarily trained and have specialized
                                                     492

 1   skill sets to respond to a crisis anywhere in

 2   the State of New York.

 3         I am here today advocating for all

 4   four police agencies of the PBA, but as

 5   today's hearing is on higher education, I

 6   will focus on the PBA members who are

 7   New York State University Police Officers and

 8   the attrition crisis facing the departments

 9   they work for.

10         The dedicated men and women who have

11   worked for New York State University Police

12   protect students, staff and general campus

13   communities of 29 of our SUNY campuses from

14   Long Island to Buffalo, the Southern Tier and

15   the North Country.   That includes three

16   campuses in New York City.   If we don't have

17   a campus in your district, we most certainly

18   have one near it.

19         Gone are the days where SUNY campuses

20   were staffed with unarmed peace officers.

21   Today SUNY campuses are protected by

22   professional police officers who are fully

23   certified, trained and expect to protect

24   campus communities from active shooters with
                                                       493

 1   rifles to terrorists with even more dangerous

 2   weapons.    We had a shooting with two deaths

 3   yesterday at Texas A&M University.    These are

 4   serious, real concerns of ours.

 5            We take our job to protect students

 6   and staff seriously.   And if you have a child

 7   or a loved one attending or working on a SUNY

 8   campus, you can sleep better at night knowing

 9   we are going to defend these people with our

10   lives.

11            There is, however, a notable weakness

12   in the State University Police of our 29

13   campuses, and that is our alarmingly high

14   attrition rates.    Specifically, I am talking

15   about the constant resignations of recently

16   hired young police officers who leave the

17   New York State University Police to join

18   other police departments, municipal or state,

19   thereby creating vacancies in their

20   respective University Police departments.

21            New York State University Police are

22   bleeding officers at an astonishing rate,

23   which is resulting in dangerous attrition

24   numbers.    The same applies to New York State
                                                     494

 1   Park Police.   Young, diverse officers fresh

 2   out of the Police Academy routinely leave PBA

 3   of NYS to join other law enforcement units

 4   that offer better pay, retirement and

 5   benefits.

 6         Research conducted by the PBA of NYS

 7   indicates that over the last six years, a

 8   total of 410 officers left the University

 9   Police forces.   One hundred eighteen of the

10   total departing 410 UPOs specifically went to

11   other law enforcement units at the state and

12   local level.   This is an astonishing

13   attrition rate of over 30 percent.

14         The main factor in attrition rates for

15   UPOs transferring to other law enforcement is

16   the lack of a 20-year retirement option in

17   the units represented by the PBA.    The

18   departments they are transferring to have

19   20-year pensions.    Attrition, however,

20   fosters the development of other problems,

21   such as diversity.   Unfortunately, as

22   research indicates, the attrition trend lines

23   are moving in the wrong direction and are

24   becoming more severe.
                                                       495

 1         Yes, there is a cost to the 20-year

 2   retirement legislation for this unit, but the

 3   savings from the stemming of attrition will

 4   offset that.   New York State spends between

 5   $100,000 and $120,000, depending on location,

 6   to hire, train and equip just one officer

 7   from the academy to their first year of

 8   service.   Simple math reveals a total

 9   attrition cost of over $12 million,

10   significantly offsetting the fiscal costs of

11   this bill.

12         More importantly than the cost savings

13   are the intangibles.   SUNY campuses, like

14   other educational institutions, are

15   considered potentially vulnerable to active

16   shooters and terrorists.   If we can't have

17   stable and well-staffed police departments,

18   how can these departments adequately protect

19   SUNY communities?    They can't.   And the high

20   attrition rate is a public safety issue that

21   must be addressed.

22         There's also a diversity issue here.

23   Competitive pay and benefits are invaluable

24   to retain and recruit female officers as well
                                                      496

 1   as young UPOs of color.   New York State takes

 2   great pride in the diversity of its SUNY

 3   campuses and system.   Shouldn't SUNY police

 4   officers reflect the campuses they serve?

 5   With the current substandard 20-year pension,

 6   SUNY campuses are at a point that they have

 7   poorly staffed police departments and lack

 8   diversity.

 9           I want to thank the Legislature for

10   understanding this and effectively addressing

11   it.   Last year the Senate and Assembly

12   overwhelmingly passed Senate 5207-Gounardes,

13   same as Assembly 4431-Abate, which would have

14   provided the PBA members a 20-year retirement

15   plan.   This body addressed the dangers of

16   unstable SUNY police forces and their lack of

17   diversity but, sadly and inexplicably,

18   Governor Cuomo vetoed the bill -- see Veto

19   Message 265 of 2019.

20           The legislation was simply about

21   parity, safety and diversity as New York

22   State Troopers and over 400 statewide

23   municipal police forces who are currently

24   entitled to a 20-year retirement plan.     You
                                                      497

 1   also passed and the Governor also vetoed the

 2   PBA's three-quarter accidental disability

 3   bill and the SUNY heart bill, which also

 4   harmed our morale and ultimately affects

 5   attrition losses as well.

 6         In closing, the PBA of New York State

 7   encourages the Legislature to provide

 8   University Police, Park Police, Forest

 9   Rangers and Environmental Conservation

10   Officers with the proper tools and give us

11   parity with other law enforcement, such as a

12   20-year retirement and three-quarters

13   accidental disability benefits.   This will

14   assure the PBA of NYS can continue to keep

15   the public safe and maximize the public

16   safety to take advantage of New York State's

17   natural beauty.

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

19         We have a question from the Senate.

20         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     We have two

21   questions from the Senate.

22         Senator Toby Stavisky.

23         SENATOR STAVISKY:     One question.    I

24   raised the issue of the attrition rate with
                                                     498

 1   the chancellor, and she was not familiar with

 2   it.   And I promised to get her the material.

 3          MR. LAW:    Okay.

 4          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Okay?   Maybe you

 5   want to reach out as a result.

 6          MR. LAW:    Can I comment on that

 7   quickly?

 8          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Excuse me?

 9          MR. LAW:    Can I comment on that

10   quickly?

11          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Sure -- no, I -- I

12   want the relationship to be a positive one

13   between the police and the SUNY

14   administration.

15          MR. LAW:    I have a very positive

16   comment.

17          SENATOR STAVISKY:   Good.

18           MR. LAW:   We did -- we were aware of

19   the testimony from earlier today.   I

20   appreciate you raising that.    And we did

21   reach out to the chancellor's office today,

22   and about an hour ago I heard back from the

23   chancellor's office, who stated that she will

24   be making an effort as early as tomorrow to
                                                        499

 1   reach out to us, or us to reach out to her,

 2   to make a meeting.

 3         SENATOR STAVISKY:     Good.   Good.

 4         MR. LAW:    Thank you.

 5         SENATOR STAVISKY:     Glad to hear that.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Senator John Liu.

 7         SENATOR LIU:     Thank you, Madam Chair.

 8         Thank you for testifying today.       I

 9   know you've been waiting all --

10         (Mic off; discussion off the record.)

11         SENATOR LIU:     There you go.   I didn't

12   even touch anything.

13         But I just wanted to thank you for

14   your testimony.   Obviously we have -- we have

15   a lot of activity on college campuses

16   nowadays, and SUNY is not -- it continues to

17   be a hotbed of activism.

18         So I recognize the sometimes very

19   difficult job that your members do to keep

20   peace on campus while allowing students as

21   much freedom as possible.    And so I certainly

22   support your attempts at parity, recognizing

23   the very difficult work that you and your

24   members do.

 1           Thank you.

 2           MR. LAW:   Thank you very much.

 3   Appreciate it.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you for

 5   being here.

 6           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Thank you.

 7           MR. LAW:   Thank you all.

 8           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Our next and

 9   final speaker, Mac-Olivier Lalanne, who I

10   understand traveled here from Plattsburgh to

11   be with us tonight.

12           MR. LALANNE:   Actually, that was a

13   quick run-down.

14           There was like a technical difficulty

15   with me printing the copies, so if you see

16   anything missing, I apologize for that.

17           And there's also -- not to repeat like

18   stuff that people said beforehand, which is

19   kind of most of the stuff I said on my

20   testimony, so I can put some additions and

21   summarize, since I have a short amount of

22   time.   So I'm going to start now.

23           (Laughter.)

24           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Okay.
                                                       501

 1         MR. LALANNE:     Good evening, members of

 2   the Assembly and the Senate.     My name is

 3   Mac-Olivier Lalanne.   I am currently a

 4   sophomore at SUNY Plattsburgh, and I reside

 5   in Brooklyn, New York.   I am here to testify

 6   on the need of funding for our college and

 7   universities on behalf of students like me

 8   attending college or preparing to attend

 9   college.

10         First I want to say thank you for your

11   efforts to invest your time, money, and

12   energy to help us students get into college,

13   and thank you for allowing me to testify.

14         Next, I would like to say that

15   although we appreciate the effort, we all

16   believe that more can be done.    Every year,

17   colleges and universities tend to increase

18   their tuition and fees, which the students

19   tend to go through tough decisions on either

20   continuing their education, apply and get a

21   private loan to pay the increase, despite the

22   consequences, in hopes to get an education,

23   get a job to pay for the increase, serve in

24   the Army via ROTC, or leave school.    And the
                                                      502

 1   list goes on.

 2         During my time as a student, I have

 3   physically witnessed times departments within

 4   SUNY Plattsburgh have come over and talked

 5   about their budget and the importance of

 6   increasing their fees -- at which I was also

 7   a senator for the Student Association.     And

 8   students were outraged, especially when the

 9   fitness or the recreation fee -- the

10   Recreation Department came over to the

11   student meeting, and the fee was approved

12   through the SUNY Board of Trustees --

13   students were outraged and even blamed the

14   Student Association for it despite the fact

15   that we had no power to approve the fee.

16         One thing that I believe is worth

17   considering is expanding the Excelsior

18   Scholarship and also the TAP, the state aid,

19   which I've -- to make it affordable for

20   people regardless of where the student goes.

21   Which as students who -- someone who goes to

22   CUNY benefits from the scholarship more than

23   a student who goes to SUNY.   As we all know,

24   the Excelsior Scholarship replaces the
                                                       503

 1   financial aid that the students are going to

 2   obtain.

 3            Another thing to consider is investing

 4   on a plan that would ensure students to pay

 5   off financial holds in their student

 6   accounts, as I too have seen many students

 7   who want to apply to classes next semester

 8   but can't do so because they have a hold in

 9   their account, thus penalizing and exploiting

10   students to pay off the hold or risk not

11   going to class or even school the next

12   semester, which is not fair for those who

13   suffer from financial difficulties or

14   hardships.

15            Another thing I would say -- oh, I'm

16   sorry.    Another thing that you all should

17   consider is granting aid for colleges and

18   universities when it comes to diversity and

19   inclusion, as I feel that yes, anyone can go

20   to college after high school, there is a lack

21   of diverse people and cultures which,

22   depending on the location of the college,

23   there is little to no resource or a voice for

24   the misrepresented people.
                                                       504

 1         During my times as a college student,

 2   I have heard stories and incidents that

 3   students like me have faced.   To summarize it

 4   all up, college administrations throughout

 5   New York State didn't quite do a good job on

 6   addressing issues concerning racial issues or

 7   that involved misrepresented people.     I know

 8   my school isn't the only one which --

 9   actually, one example is that -- which is a

10   true story.

11         A year before I came in, which was the

12   year of two thousand -- well, the year I came

13   in was 2018.   But in 2017 there was a

14   Snapchat incident which, to summarize it, was

15   a student that kind of like -- there was a

16   student that is currently not in school

17   posted like a social media post that was kind

18   of insensitive towards the black community in

19   the school.

20         The administration didn't really quite

21   do a good job and -- which led to like the

22   school revitalizing the administration to

23   include a diversity and inclusion position,

24   to create a community room for unrepresented
                                                      505

 1   people, and the list goes on.

 2         Thank you for allowing me and other

 3   people to testify, and I hope this

 4   legislative session goes well for you all.

 5         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

 6         Senator Krueger.

 7         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Just one

 8   question.

 9         So in your testimony you talk about

10   that the college that I think you're at is

11   not necessarily handling diversity and

12   differences that well.   But you also say you

13   think that CUNY students' aid goes further

14   than SUNY students'.   I don't think there's a

15   difference.   So can you clarify that for me?

16         MR. LALANNE:     Well, because like for

17   the -- for like the Excelsior Scholarship,

18   like you will benefit more because like for

19   CUNY, people get to commute through -- like

20   if I would, say, go to Brooklyn College,

21   currently my time, I could like literally

22   just like commute through the train and won't

23   really cause as much of a problem.

24         But if I were to go to like a SUNY, it
                                                          506

 1   would like deny all of my financial aid and

 2   then I would have to pay all of the fees

 3   for -- because I am also a on-campus student.

 4           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     Okay.   So I guess

 5   I'll leave it there for tonight.        Because I

 6   didn't think we had different standards --

 7   just the room and board difference --

 8           MR. LALANNE:   Yes, room and board and

 9   fees.

10           CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:     -- not the other

11   amounts.

12           Okay, thank you very much.      Thank you

13   for your testimony.

14           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Thank you.

15   Just a quick question.   What part of Brooklyn

16   are you from?

17           MR. LALANNE:   I am from Crown Heights.

18           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Okay.    So

19   walking distance to Medgar Evers, and you

20   went all the way upstate.

21           (Laughter.)

22           MR. LALANNE:   Yup.

23           CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:    Okay.    Well,

24   you're getting a good education.        Thank you
                                                       507

 1   so much for being here and helping to be the

 2   face of the students that we are working to

 3   make sure can succeed at college.    Thank you.

 4         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

 5         MR. LALANNE:   And also I actually

 6   didn't read this in my testimony, which --

 7   sorry to hold the time over.    I would also

 8   like to consider more aid and funding when it

 9   comes to food pantries and also more aid and

10   funding when it comes to the civic engagement

11   and voter participation, as I feel like yes,

12   colleges can grant students those services,

13   but voter registration there is not

14   completely enough for those types of

15   services.

16         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     Thank you.

17         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:      Thank you.

18         CHAIRWOMAN WEINSTEIN:     So thank you

19   for being here, and feel free to -- you

20   can -- everybody, not just you -- people can

21   have up to seven days after the hearing ends

22   to submit additional testimony or new

23   testimony if they haven't yet done so.

24         So this concludes the Higher Education
                                                      508

 1   hearing.   The joint budget committees will be

 2   reconvening at 9:30 tomorrow morning for the

 3   Workforce Development budget hearing and at

 4   noon for the Housing budget hearing.

 5         Thank you.

 6         CHAIRWOMAN KRUEGER:    Thank you.
