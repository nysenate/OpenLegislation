       1             SENATOR RITCHIE:  Welcome.  Good afternoon,

       2      everyone.

       3             I would like to open the public hearing of

       4      the New York State Agriculture Committee on the

       5      issue of cruelty to companion animals, by thanking

       6      everyone for joining us today.

       7             And I'm joined by my colleague on the

       8      Agriculture Committee, Senator Valesky;

       9             And, also, Senator Griffo, whose home

      10      district this is.  And I would like to thank

      11      Senator Griffo for inviting me today to deal with

      12      this important issue.

      13             Due to time constraints, today's testimony is

      14      by invitation only.  But, I would like to tell

      15      anyone in the audience, if you're interested in

      16      submitting comments, suggestions, please feel free

      17      to submit your written testimony to my office,

      18      either in Watertown or in Albany.  And we certainly

      19      would appreciate it, and we'll check each submitted

      20      testimony in, and we will respond, and let you know

      21      the progress we're making.

      22             So, thank you for coming today.

      23             Today we will hear testimony from law

      24      enforcement and from the American Society of -- for

      25      the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, "ASPCA," and
