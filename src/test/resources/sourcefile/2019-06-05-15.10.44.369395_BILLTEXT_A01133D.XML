        AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation  to  definitions  and
          conforming  changes  pertaining  to  anatomical  gifts;  and to repeal
          certain provisions of such law relating thereto (Part A); to amend the
          public health law, in relation to changes in anatomical  gift  consent
          (Part  B);  and to amend the public health law, in relation to changes
          in anatomical gift revocation and amendment (Part C)
 
          <B><U>The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and  Assem-</U></B>
        <B><U>bly, do enact as follows:</U></B>
 
     1    Section  1.  Legislative intent. The purpose of this legislation is to
     2  enact changes to follow  the  Uniform  Anatomical  Gift  Act  (UAGA)  as
     3  updated  in  2006 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
     4  State Laws to enhance the  organ  donation  process.  Most  states  have
     5  adopted  these  changes.  While New York has made recent improvements to
     6  our organ donation rules and  participation  rates,  we  are  still  way
     7  behind most states and, as a result, still face a severe organ shortage.
     8  It  is  estimated that bringing New York's anatomical gift consent rules
     9  into agreement with UAGA would produce an additional 100 donors - for  a
    10  total of 200-300 additional organs available - over five years.
    11    &#167;  2. This act enacts into law changes to the anatomical gift process.
    12  Each component is wholly contained within a Part identified as  Parts  A
    13  through  C.  The  effective date for each particular provision contained
    14  within such Part is set forth in the last  section  of  such  Part.  Any
 
         EXPLANATION--Matter in <B><U>italics</U></B> (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
                              [<B><S> </S></B>] is old law to be omitted.
                                                                   LBD03867-09-9
