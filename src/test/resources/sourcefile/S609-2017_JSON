          "memo" : " BILL NUMBER:  S609\n\n TITLE OF BILL :  An act to amend the real property law, in relation\nto training and continuing education requirements for home inspector\nlicensing\n\n PURPOSE :  The purpose of this bill is to update required training\nand continuing education requirements for home inspectors.\n\n SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS :\n\nThis bill will increase the number of required training hours from one\nhundred and forty to two hundred hours and increase the required\namount of unpaid field training from forty to eighty hours.\n\nThe bill also clarifies that the required continuing education course\nshould be at least thirty two hours, up to which eight hours may be\ncompleted through online education.\n\nFinally, this legislation directs the Secretary of State to review and\nestablish rules and regulations pertaining to the number and manner of\nunpaid field-based training and the manner and hours of continuing\neducation courses, including those for online education.\n\n JUSTIFICATION :\n\nThis bill, supported by the New York State Association of Home\nInspectors, will increase the required training to become a licensed\nhome inspector. This increase will strengthen training for new home\ninspectors and ensure more effective inspections. The present 140\nhours of initial training for licensure are insufficient to ensure an\nadequate understanding of the significance, condition, and failure\nmodes of the numerous electrical, mechanical, and structural systems\nwithin a home, resulting in significant missed or misinterpreted\nconditions during home inspections. This increase in hours will ensure\nthat new home inspectors are trained to the highest standard and fully\nequipped to protect home buyers.\n\nThe bill also asks the Secretary of State to review and establish\nrules and regulations regarding the manner and number of hours\nrequired for unpaid field-based inspections as part of the training.\nThe 40 hour on-site training portion of the existing initial training\nrequirements do not allow enough time for trainees to learn to\nsuccessfully identify essential components and to properly explain the\nrelative significance of observed deficiencies to clients. Modern\nresidential construction and remodeling are constantly undergoing\nmajor changes in methods and materials, as well as energy conservation\nmeasures and techniques, requiring significant continuing education\nand training.\n\nThe Secretary will also review and establish rules and regulations\nregarding the number of hours required for continuing education and\nhow to establish an online education component of the required\ncontinuing education. The present 24 hours of continuing education\ncredits required per two year renewal period are insufficient to\nensure that licensed inspectors are fully aware of new construction\ncodes and practices, and able to effectively communicate any observed\nconcerns regarding these systems to clients. This will not only make\nthe continuing education more accessible, but also ensure that home\ninspectors are receiving the most up to date training available.\n\n LEGISLATIVE HISTORY :\n\nNew bill.\n\n FISCAL IMPLICATIONS :\nNone.\n\n EFFECTIVE DATE :\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n",
