                  STATE OF NEW YORK--EXECUTIVE CHAMBER
 
TO THE ASSEMBLY:                                        April 13, 2008
 
     I  hereby transmit pursuant to the provisions of section 7 of Arti-
cle IV and section 4 of Article VII of the Constitution, a statement  of
items  to which I object and which I do not approve, contained in Assem-
bly Bill Number 9000--D, entitled:
 
CHAPTER 50
 
LINE VETO #2
 
"AN ACT making appropriations for the support of government
 
                          STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET"
 
Bill Page 124, Line 31 through Line 35, inclusive
 
NOT APPROVED
____________
 
                          EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
 
 "For services and expenses for the supervision of  institutions  regis-
    tered  pursuant  to  section  5001  of  the  education  law, and for
    services and expenses of supervisory programs and payment of associ-
    ated indirect costs and general state charges.
  Personal service--regular ... 1,747,000 ............... (re. $200,000)"
 
This item passed by the Legislature,  to  which  I  object  and  do  not
approve,  is  not needed because adequate funding for State agency oper-
ations is already provided for in the budget. Accordingly, this item  is
disapproved.
 
                                              (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
