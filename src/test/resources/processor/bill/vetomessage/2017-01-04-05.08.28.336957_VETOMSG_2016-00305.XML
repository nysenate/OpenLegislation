                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 305
 
TO THE SENATE:
 
I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:
 
Senate Bill Number 6948, entitled:
 
    "AN  ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to establishing
      a hospital supplemental reimbursement rate adjustment for enhanced
      safety net hospitals"
 
    NOT APPROVED
 
  This bill would amend the Public Health Law to give an "Enhanced Safe-
ty Net" designation and higher reimbursement rates to certain  hospitals
that treat a disproportionate share of Medicaid and uninsured patients.
 
  I remain fully committed to providing access to high-qualified care to
medically underserved communities. For example, the Department of Health
continually works to provide support to financially distressed hospitals
through  the  State's  Value  Based  Payment Quality Improvement Program
(VBP-QIP). This program  enables  financially  distressed  hospitals  to
continue  their  administrative  operations  and  provide vital services
while they implement plans to ensure long-term stability, improve quali-
ty of care, and ensure overall alignment with the  State's  Value  Based
Payment initiatives.
 
  As drafted, however, this bill would result in increased and unbudget-
ed costs to the Medicaid program, which will ultimately be shouldered by
the State's taxpayers. Such funding decisions, both in terms of revenues
available  and  appropriations  to  be  expended,  have always been, and
should continue to be, addressed in the context  of  the  annual  budget
negotiations. I am therefore constrained to veto this bill.
 
  This bill is disapproved.                   (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
 
                               __________
