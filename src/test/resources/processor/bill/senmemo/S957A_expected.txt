BILL NUMBER: S957A

SPONSOR: CROCI
 
TITLE OF BILL:  An act to amend the penal law, in relation to creating
the crime of stolen valor

 
PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:

This bill establishes the new crime of stolen valor and directs that a
stolen valor fee be assessed against those convicted and deposited in to
the veterans cemetery fund.

 
SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:

Sections one amends the penal law by defining member of the military or
reserves and defining veteran.

Section two amends the penal law by establishing the new crime of stolen
valor, which is classified as a class E felony.

Section three amends the penal law by establishing a stolen valor fee
and providing that any person convicted of the crime of stolen valor
shall pay a stolen valor fee in the amount of $250. Further, this
section provides that stolen valor fees shall be deposited in to the
veterans remembrance and cemetery maintenance and operation fund.

Section four provides the effective date.

 
JUSTIFICATION:

Impersonating the men and women who bravely serve our country for the
purpose of obtaining money or other benefits is a deplorable act.
Sadly, occurrences such as these have become all too common. In addition
to establishing the state crime of stolen valor, this bill directs that
a stolen valor fee be assessed against those convicted, and that the fee
be deposited in to the veterans remembrance and cemetery maintenance
operation fund. Requiring these criminals to pay a stolen valor fee,
which will be used to establish and maintain a state Veterans Cemetery,
is a fitting way to ensure that our real veterans are honored appropri-
ately.

 
PRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:
