&nbsp
<B><U>TITLE OF BILL</U></B>:  An act to amend the penal law, in relation to creating
a presumption of intent to sell
 
&nbsp
<B><U>PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL</U></B>:
 
To assist in the prosecution of heroin dealers who are profiting from
the epidemic that is claiming so many young lives, by creating a
presumption that the possession of 50 or more individual packages
containing heroin and/or having an aggregate value of $300.00 is
possession with intent to sell.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</U></B>:
 
Section 1. The penal law is amended by adding a new section 220.26 that
for the purposes of a prosecution of Criminal Possession of a Controlled
Substance in the Third Degree where the person knowingly and unlawfully
possesses a narcotic drug with intent to sell (PL 220.16 (1), fifty or
more individual packages of heroin, or heroin with the aggregate value
of three hundred dollars or more is presumptive evidence of intent to
sell.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>JUSTIFICATION</U></B>:
 
Heroin is destroying the fabric of our society, evidenced by the daily
news of overdose deaths throughout New York State. Because of the phys-
ical nature of heroin, dealers can carry large quantities of the drug
before triggering a felony charge of possession. Conversely, due to the
nature of heroin use and addiction, heroin users do not possess more
heroin than they intend to use at that time, as one high on heroin has
no impulse control and will continue to consume all heroin available
until it is gone. Some prosecutors have called expert witnesses to
testify to the nature of this addiction to support a prosecution for
Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Third Degree under
the intent to sell subdivision, but not all prosecuting offices have the
means to do so, yet are still faced with the increase in heroin sales
and heroin overdose deaths. This bill would provide all communities with
the necessary tool to target heroin dealers and stop the flow of this
dangerous drug.
