<B><U>TITLE OF BILL</U></B>:  An act to amend the transportation law, in relation to
enacting the "taxi driver protection act" requiring the posting of signs
in for-hire vehicles to prevent assault
 
&nbsp
<B><U>PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL</U></B>:
 
To protect Drivers from being assaulted on the job by posting signs in
For Hire vehicles alerting passengers of the punishment for assaulting
drivers.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</U></B>:
 
Section 1 titles the bill the "taxi driver protection act."
 
Section 2 amends section 140 of the transportation law to allow every
for-hire vehicle to post a sign on the interior of such vehicle that
states "ATTENTION: Assaulting a Taxi Driver Is Punishable by up To Twen-
ty-Five Years in Prison."
 
Section 3 provides the Commissioner to promulgate any rules and regu-
lations necessary form the implementation as well as determining a
punishment for failure to post signs.
 
Section 4 provides for the act to take effect on the 180th Day.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>JUSTIFICATION</U></B>:
 
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, taxi
workers are thirty times more likely to be killed on the job than other
workers are. New York City is home to the largest taxi driver industry
in the country. Posting warning signs in taxicabs would facilitate a
public information campaign designed to inform the public that attacks
on taxi workers are a very serious offense.
