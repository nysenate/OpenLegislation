&nbsp
<B><U>TITLE OF BILL</U></B>:  An act to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in
relation to the service of notice of parking violations
 
&nbsp
<B><U>PURPOSE</U></B>:
 
To permit municipalities to provide motor vehicle owners with the notice
of a parking violation through the mail.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS</U></B>:
 
Section 1. Creates a new section 1605 of the vehicle and traffic law to
permit municipalities to provide motor vehicle owners with the notice of
a parking violation through the mail.
 
Section 2. Amends section 238 of the vehicle and traffic law to permit
municipalities to provide motor vehicle owners with the notice of a
parking violation through the mail
 
Section 3. Effective date.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>JUSTIFICATION</U></B>:
 
This legislation would update the Vehicle and Traffic Law to grant muni-
cipalities the option to provide motor vehicle owners with the notice of
a parking violation through the mail. Current law requires that the
notice of a violation be placed on the vehicle, and does not permit
service of the notice of violation through the mail.
 
Permitting municipalities to provide vehicle owners with the notice of
parking violation through the mail will allow for municipalities to
utilize new technologies, and engage in a more efficient enforcement
process, resulting in higher municipal revenues.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</U></B>:
 
2016: A .9282/S .6822
 
&nbsp
<B><U>FISCAL IMPLICATIONS</U></B>:
 
None to State.
 
&nbsp
<B><U>EFFECTIVE DATE</U></B>:
Immediately.
