such  conduct,  and  provide for appropriate training for all members of
the Assembly and Assembly  staff.  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
deemed  to  require  the  repromulgation  of  a sexual harassment policy
statement which is already in effect and which meets the requirements of
this rule. Copies of the sexual harassment policy promulgated  hereunder
shall  be  distributed to all members of the Assembly and Assembly staff
and shall be available to the public.
  õ 6. Affirmative action policy. The Speaker shall promulgate a  policy

meets the requirements of this rule. Copies of  the  affirmative  action
policy  promulgated hereunder shall be distributed to all members of the
Assembly and Assembly staff and shall be available to the public.
  õ 7. Non-fraternization policy. The Speaker shall promulgate a  policy

define  the  conduct  which is prohibited, and establish a procedure for
investigation of alleged violations of  the  policy.  Nothing  contained
herein  shall  be deemed to require promulgation of a non-fraternization
policy which is already in effect and which  meets  the  requirement  of
this rule. Copies of the non-fraternization policy promulgated hereunder
shall  be  distributed to all members of the Assembly and Assembly staff
and shall be available to the public.
  õ 8. Budget adoption schedule. Within ten days of  submission  of  the
budget by the Governor, the Speaker shall promulgate a schedule of dates
for  consideration  and  passage of the budget appropriation and related
bills. Such dates shall include dates for public hearings on such bills,
dates for the issuance of forecasts and dates for the  passage  of  such
appropriation  bills. Such schedule, to the extent practicable, shall be
promulgated  jointly  with  the  Temporary  President  of  the   Senate.
Provided,  however,  upon  the  adoption  of  a budget adoption schedule
pursuant to Joint Rule II, the  provisions  of  such  Joint  Rule  shall
supercede the provisions of this section.
                                 RULE II
                      ORDER OF BUSINESS AND MOTIONS
  Section  1.  Stenographer. It shall be the duty of the Stenographer of
the Assembly to be present at  every  session  of  the  House.  A  daily
stenographic  record  of  the proceedings of the House shall be made and
copies thereof shall be available to the public, at a  place  designated
by  the  Speaker,  within  ten  days  following  the date upon which the
proceedings took place.
  õ 2. Hours in session. The House shall convene at 2:00 P.M. on  Monday
and  11:00 A.M. on other days unless otherwise ordered. No session shall
extend beyond eight hours nor shall it occur between 12:00 A.M. and 6:00
A.M.  provided, however, the House may remain  in  session  to  complete
action  on  a  measure  or measures being debated or to take action on a
measure or measures if a message of necessity has been received from the
governor in connection with such measure or measures or upon a  majority
vote  of all of the members elected to the Assembly. For the purposes of
this section, the passage of time shall be observed in  accordance  with
section  fifty-two of the general construction law and shall not include
time that the House is in recess or standing at ease.
  õ 3. Order of business. a. The first business of  each  day's  session
shall  be  the  reading  of  the  Journal  of the preceding day, and the
correction of any errors that may be found to exist  therein,  provided,
however, that such reading of the Journal may be waived, without debate,
upon a majority vote of the members present and provided further that on
any  day  on  which  bills  on any order of third reading are before the
House for final disposition, and a vote is to be taken thereon,  a  roll
call  of the members shall be taken for attendance purposes prior to the
reading of such Journal. Such roll  call  may  be  taken  by  electronic
device.  Immediately  thereafter,  except on days and at times set apart
for the consideration of special orders, the order  of  business,  which
shall not be departed from except by a vote of two-thirds of the members
present, to be determined by a call of the roll, shall be as follows:
  (1)  messages  from  the  Governor and from the Senate, communications
from State officers and reports from State institutions;
  (2) introduction of bills and reference to committee;
  (3) reports of committees;
  (4) bills on second reading;
  (5) bills on third reading;
  (6) Assembly bills amended by the Senate; and
  (7) introduction of original resolutions.
  b.  At the commencement of each day's session the Majority Leader,  or
his  or  her designee, shall announce a schedule of legislation intended
for consent and debate. All  bills  appearing  on  the  order  of  third
reading  or  the order of special second and third reading for the first
time shall be included within such schedule.
  c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of  this  section,
messages  from  the Governor and Senate, communications and reports from
State officers, reports from the Judiciary Committee which  involve  the
right  of  a member to his or her seat and reports from the Committee on
Rules shall be received at any time.
  d.  When consideration of the orders of the day is not finished, those
not  acted upon shall be the orders for the next and each succeeding day
until disposed of, and shall be entered first in  the  Calendar  without
change in their order.
  e.    Any matter may be made a special order for any particular day by
the assent of two-thirds of the  members  present.    When  so  made,  a
similar vote shall be required to rescind or postpone such matter.
  f.  Petitions,  memorials  and  remonstrances  may be presented to the
Clerk of the Assembly at the close of each day's session.
  õ 4. Motions; previous questions. a.  When a question  is  before  the
Assembly, only the following motions shall be received, and such motions
shall have precedence in the order stated:
  (1) for an adjournment of the House;
  (2) a call of the House;
  (3) for the previous question;
  (4) to lay on the table;
  (5) to postpone to a certain day;
  (6) to commit;
  (7) to amend;
  (8) to postpone indefinitely; and
  (9) to strike from the Calendar.
  b.  A  motion  to  reconsider any vote must be made on the same day on
which the vote proposed to be reconsidered  was  taken,  or  within  the
three  legislative days next succeeding such day, and except in the case
of a vote on the final passage of a bill, by a member who voted  in  the
majority,  providing, however, that the vote upon the final passage of a
bill recalled from the Senate may be reconsidered at any time  after  it
is  returned to the House.  A motion to reconsider may be made under any
order of business but shall  be  considered  only  under  the  order  of
business  in  which  the  vote proposed to be reconsidered occurred. The
motion to reconsider the vote on the final passage of any bill shall  be
privileged  to  any member, but no motion for the reconsideration of any
vote shall be in order,  after  a  bill,  resolution,  message,  report,
amendment or motion upon which the vote was taken shall have gone out of
the  possession  of the House, unless subsequently recalled by a vote of
the House and in possession of the Clerk of the Assembly.
  c. When a motion for reconsideration is decided, that  decision  shall
not  be  reconsidered,  and no question shall be twice reconsidered; nor
shall any vote be reconsidered upon the following motions:
  (1) to adjourn;
  (2) to lay on the table;
  (3) to take from the table; and
  (4) for the previous question.
  d.  The  "previous  question" shall be put as follows: "Shall the main
question now be put?" and  until  it  is  decided,  shall  preclude  all
amendments  or debate.  When, on taking the previous question, the House
shall decide that the main question shall  not  now  be  put,  the  main
question  shall be considered as still remaining under debate. The "main
question" shall be the advancement or passage of the bill, resolution or
other matter under consideration; but when amendments are  pending,  the
question shall first be taken upon such amendments in their order.
            PERMANENT JOINT RULES OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
                              JOINT RULE I
  Section  1.  Requirement  of  Fiscal Impact Notes. Fiscal impact notes
shall be required  for  all  bills  and  amendments,  other  than  those
excepted  as  provided in section four hereof, which would substantially
affect the revenues or expenses, or both, of  any  county,  city,  town,
village, school district or special district (hereinafter referred to as
"political  subdivisions").  For purposes of this Joint Rule and section
51 of the Legislative Law, the term  "special  district"  shall  mean  a
district  possessing  the  power  to  contract  indebtedness and levy or
require the levy of taxes or benefit assessments upon real property.
  õ 2. Sufficiency and Contents of Fiscal Impact  Notes.  Fiscal  impact
notes  shall  be  deemed  sufficient  for purposes of this Joint Rule if
prepared in conformity with this section.
  A.  Scope  of  fiscal  estimates.   Fiscal   impact   upon   political
subdivisions  shall  be estimated on the basis of any one or more of the
following:
  (i) Individual political subdivisions; or
  (ii) Aggregates of political subdivisions (a) statewide or  by  lesser
geographic  area,  or  (b)  by  classification  or  subclassification of
relevant characteristics; or
  (iii)   Representative   political    subdivisions    with    relevant
characteristics  thereof  quantitatively  set  forth,  e.g., population,
area, weighted average daily attendance of pupils; or
  (iv) Any other  appropriate,  convenient  or  accessible  grouping  of
political subdivisions.
  B.  Units  of measurement. Fiscal impact measurements shall be made in
units of money, personal services, equipment, or any other  appropriate,
convenient or accessible units of measurement.
  C.  Negligible  Impact. A fiscal impact note filed by the sponsor of a
bill which states that the fiscal impact of the bill is negligible shall
be deemed to be in compliance with this Joint Rule.
  õ 3. Procedure. A. (i) The Temporary President of the Senate  and  the
Speaker  of the Assembly shall each designate a person in such officer's
respective house to examine each bill in such house, without  regard  to
its  house  of  origin, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a fiscal
impact note is required pursuant to this Joint Rule, and if such note is
required, such person shall so notify the sponsor of such bill.
  (ii) The sponsor of such bill shall provide such fiscal impact note on
a separate form prescribed therefor by the Temporary  President  of  the
Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly jointly.
  (iii)  Such  fiscal  impact note shall state the source thereof, which
may be the sponsor; provided, however,  that  in  the  case  of  a  bill
proposed  by  a  state department or agency, such note shall be prepared
and furnished by such department or agency.
  (iv) Such designated person in each house shall thereupon review  each
fiscal  impact  note  for  compliance  with the provisions of this Joint
Rule.
  B.  No  bill  requiring  a fiscal impact note shall be reported to the
floor of the house unless accompanied by the appropriate  note  for  the
version  of  such  bill  so reported, except as provided in section four
hereof.
  C. If an amendment to a bill has a fiscal impact, the member  offering
such  amendment  shall  provide  the fiscal impact note required by such
amendment. If such amendment  prevails,  the  sponsor  shall  provide  a
fiscal  impact  note  for  the amended bill before final passage, unless
excepted pursuant to subdivision F of section four hereof.
  õ 4. Exceptions. A fiscal impact note shall  not  be  required  for  a
bill:
  A. subject to the provisions of section 50 of the Legislative Law;
  B. requested by a county, city, town or village in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section two of Article
IX of the Constitution;
  C. which provides discretionary authority to a political subdivision;
  D. submitted pursuant to section 24 of the State Finance Law;
  E.  reported to the floor of the House by the Rules Committee, if such
committee, in its discretion, determines that  such  action  is  in  the
public interest;
  F. which has been amended on the floor of either house, where a fiscal
impact  note would otherwise have been required for such amended bill by
this Joint Rule and section 51 of the Legislative Law, if the  Temporary
President of the Senate or the Speaker of the Assembly, respectively, in
such officer's discretion, determines that the amended bill may be acted
on in such officer's house without such note; or
  G.  which  inadvertently  passes the Legislature where a fiscal impact
note would otherwise have been required by this Joint Rule  and  section
51 of the Legislative Law.
  õ 5. Effect of Inaccuracy. If the estimate or estimates contained in a
fiscal  impact  note  are  inaccurate, such inaccuracy shall not affect,
impair or invalidate such bill.
  õ 6. Application. The provisions of this Joint  Rule  shall  apply  to
bills  and  amendments proposed for introduction at the nineteen hundred
eighty-five regular legislative session and permanently thereafter.
                              JOINT RULE II
  Section  1.  Committee  on  Conference. The Temporary President of the
Senate and the Speaker of the  Assembly  may  jointly  convene  a  Joint
Committee  on  Conference  to  consider  and  report  upon substantially
similar but not identical legislation that has passed each House of  the
Legislature.  Such  committee  shall  be  constituted by the filing of a
joint certificate by the Temporary  President  of  the  Senate  and  the
Speaker  of  the Assembly with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk
of the Assembly, and shall consist of the same number  of  members  from
each House. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate, there shall be
five  members  on  such committee from each House to be appointed by the
Temporary President of the Senate who shall appoint the members from the
Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly who  shall  appoint  the  members
from the Assembly; provided, however, that of each House's delegation at
least  one  member  shall  represent  the  minority  in  each House. The
Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly  shall
each  appoint a co-chairperson of the committee and such co-chairpersons
shall convene and recess meetings of  the  committee.  Meetings  jointly
convened  by  the  co-chairpersons shall be subject to the provisions of
Article 7 of the Public Officers Law. The committee shall file a written
report setting forth the joint recommendations of  a  majority  of  each
House's delegation with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the
Assembly or such other committees or officers as may be set forth in the
certificate  and  such  report  may  include specific bill language that
would implement the joint committee's recommendations. No  report  shall
be  filed  except upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members
of each House's delegation on the committee.
