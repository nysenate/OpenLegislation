  * õ 2. Legislative finding. The legislature hereby finds and declares
that a serious public emergency continues to exist in the housing of a
considerable number of persons in the state of New York which emergency
was at its inception created by war, the effects of war and the
aftermath of hostilities, that such emergency necessitated the
intervention of federal, state and local government in order to prevent
speculative, unwarranted and abnormal increases in rents; that there
continues to exist in many areas of the state an acute shortage of
housing accommodations caused by continued high demand, attributable in
part to new household formations and decreased supply, in large measure
attributable to reduced availability of federal subsidies, and increased
costs of construction and other inflationary factors; that a substantial
number of persons residing in housing not presently subject to the
provisions of the emergency housing rent control law or the local
emergency housing rent control act are being charged excessive and
unwarranted rents and rent increases; that preventive action by the
legislature continues to be imperative in order to prevent exaction of
unjust, unreasonable and oppressive rents and rental agreements and to
forestall profiteering, speculation and other disruptive practices
tending to produce threats to the public health, safety and general
welfare; that in order to prevent uncertainty, hardship and dislocation,
the provisions of this act are necessary and designed to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare; that the transition from
regulation to a normal market of free bargaining between landlord and
tenant, while the ultimate objective of state policy, must take place
with due regard for such emergency; and that the policy herein expressed
shall be subject to determination of the existence of a public emergency
requiring the regulation of residential rents within any city, town or
village by the local legislative body of such city, town or village.

  * õ 3. Local determination of emergency; end of emergency. a. The
existence of public emergency requiring the regulation of residential
rents for all or any class or classes of housing accommodations,
including any plot or parcel of land which had been rented prior to May
first, nineteen hundred fifty, for the purpose of permitting the tenant
thereof to construct or place his own dwelling thereon and on which plot
or parcel of land there exists a dwelling owned and occupied by a tenant
of such plot or parcel, heretofore destabilized; heretofore or hereafter
decontrolled, exempt, not subject to control, or exempted from
regulation and control under the provisions of the emergency housing
rent control law, the local emergency housing rent control act or the
New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine; or
subject to stabilization or control under such rent stabilization law,
shall be a matter for local determination within each city, town or
village. Any such determination shall be made by the local legislative
body of such city, town or village on the basis of the supply of housing
accommodations within such city, town or village, the condition of such
accommodations and the need for regulating and controlling residential
rents within such city, town or village. A declaration of emergency may
be made as to any class of housing accommodations if the vacancy rate
for the housing accommodations in such class within such municipality is
not in excess of five percent and a declaration of emergency may be made
as to all housing accommodations if the vacancy rate for the housing
accommodations within such municipality is not in excess of five
percent.
  b. The local governing body of a city, town or village having declared
an emergency pursuant to subdivision a of this section may at any time,
on the basis of the supply of housing accommodations within such city,
town or village, the condition of such accommodations and the need for
continued regulation and control of residential rents within such
municipality, declare that the emergency is either wholly or partially
abated or that the regulation of rents pursuant to this act does not
serve to abate such emergency and thereby remove one or more classes of
accommodations from regulation under this act. The emergency must be
declared at an end once the vacancy rate described in subdivision a of
this section exceeds five percent.
  c. No resolution declaring the existence or end of an emergency, as
authorized by subdivisions a and b of this section, may be adopted
except after public hearing held on not less than ten days public
notice, as the local legislative body may reasonably provide.

  * õ 4. Establishment of rent guidelines boards; duties. a. In each
county wherein any city having a population of less than one million or
any town or village has determined the existence of an emergency
pursuant to section three of this act, there shall be created a rent
guidelines board to consist of nine members appointed by the
commissioner of housing and community renewal upon recommendation of the
county legislature which recommendation shall be made within thirty days
after the first local declaration of an emergency in such county; two
such members shall be representative of tenants, two shall be
representative of owners of property, and five shall be public members
each of whom shall have had at least five years experience in either
finance, economics or housing. One public member shall be designated by
the commissioner to serve as chairman and shall hold no other public
office. No member, officer or employee of any municipal rent regulation
agency or the state division of housing and community renewal and no
person who owns or manages real estate covered by this law or who is an
officer of any owner or tenant organization shall serve on a rent
guidelines board. One public member, one member representative of
tenants and one member representative of owners shall serve for a term
ending two years from January first next succeeding the date of their
appointment; one public member, one member representative of tenants and
one member representative of owners shall serve for terms ending three
years from the January first next succeeding the date of their
appointment and three public members shall serve for terms ending four
years from January first next succeeding the dates of their appointment.
Thereafter, all members shall serve for terms of four years each.
Members shall continue in office until their successors have been
appointed and qualified. The commissioner shall fill any vacancy which
may occur by reason of death, resignation or otherwise in a manner
consistent with the original appointment. A member may be removed by the
commissioner for cause, but not without an opportunity to be heard in
person or by counsel, in his defense, upon not less than ten days
notice. Compensation for the members of the board shall be at the rate
of one hundred dollars per day, for no more than twenty days a year,
except that the chairman shall be compensated at the rate of one hundred
twenty-five dollars a day for no more than thirty days a year. The board
shall be provided staff assistance by the division of housing and
community renewal. The compensation of such members and the costs of
staff assistance shall be paid by the division of housing and community
renewal which shall be reimbursed in the manner prescribed in section
four of this act. The local legislative body of each city having a
population of less than one million and each town and village in which
an emergency has been determined to exist as herein provided shall be
authorized to designate one person who shall be representative of
tenants and one person who shall be representative of owners of property
to serve at its pleasure and without compensation to advise and assist
the county rent guidelines board in matters affecting the adjustment of
rents for housing accommodations in such city, town or village as the
case may be.
  b. A county rent guidelines board shall establish annually guidelines
for rent adjustments which, at its sole discretion may be varied and
different for and within the several zones and jurisdictions of the
board, and in determining whether rents for housing accommodations as to
which an emergency has been declared pursuant to this act shall be
adjusted, shall consider among other things (1) the economic condition
of the residential real estate industry in the affected area including
such factors as the prevailing and projected (i) real estate taxes and
sewer and water rates, (ii) gross operating maintenance costs (including
insurance rates, governmental fees, cost of fuel and labor costs), (iii)
costs and availability of financing (including effective rates of
interest), (iv) over-all supply of housing accommodations and over-all
vacancy rates, (2) relevant data from the current and projected cost of
living indices for the affected area, (3) such other data as may be made
available to it. As soon as practicable after its creation and
thereafter not later than July first of each year, a rent guidelines
board shall file with the state division of housing and community
renewal its findings for the preceding calendar year, and shall
accompany such findings with a statement of the maximum rate or rates of
rent adjustment, if any, for one or more classes of accommodation
subject to this act, authorized for leases or other rental agreements
commencing during the next succeeding twelve months. The standards for
rent adjustments may be applicable for the entire county or may be
varied according to such zones or jurisdictions within such county as
the board finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this subdivision.
  The standards for rent adjustments established annually shall be
effective for leases commencing on October first of each year and during
the next succeeding twelve months whether or not the board has filed its
findings and statement of the maximum rate or rates of rent adjustment
by July first of each year. If such lease is entered into before such
filing by the board, it may provide for the rent to be adjusted by the
rates then in effect, subject to change by the applicable rates of rent
adjustment when filed, such change to be effective as of the date of the
commencement of the lease. Said lease must provide that, if the new
rates of rent adjustment differ for leases of different terms, the
tenant has the option of changing the original lease term to any other
term for which a rate of rent adjustment is set by the board, with the
rental to be adjusted accordingly.
  Where a city, town or village shall act to determine the existence of
public emergency pursuant to section three of this act subsequent to the
establishment of annual guidelines for rent adjustments of the
accommodations subject to this act, the rent guidelines board as soon as
practicable thereafter shall file its findings and rates of rent
adjustment for leases or other rental agreements for the housing
accommodations in such a city, town or village, which rates shall be
effective for leases or other rental agreements commencing on or after
the effective date of the determination.
  c. In a city having a population of one million or more, the rent
guidelines board shall be the rent guidelines board established pursuant
to the New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred
sixty-nine as amemded, and such board shall have the powers granted
pursuant to the New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred
sixty-nine as amended.
  d. Maximum rates of rent adjustment shall not be established more than
once annually for any housing accommodation within a board's
jurisdiction. Once established, no such rate shall, within the one-year
period, be adjusted by any surcharge, supplementary adjustment or other
modification.

rent control law or the local emergency housing rent control act and on
which plot or parcel of land there exists a dwelling owned and occupied

contain six or more dwelling units if it is part of a multiple family
garden-type maisonette dwelling complex containing six or more dwelling

tax law, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (i) of paragraph

effective with respect to housing accommodations which the commissioner
determines or finds that the landlord or any person acting on his or her
behalf, with intent to cause the tenant to vacate, has engaged in any
course of conduct (including, but not limited to, interruption or
discontinuance of required services) which interfered with or disturbed
or was intended to interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace
or quiet of the tenant in his or her use or occupancy of the housing

  * õ 5-a. High income rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of this
section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross income as
reported on the New York state income tax return. Total annual income
means the sum of the annual incomes of all persons whose names are
recited as the tenant or co-tenant on a lease who occupy the housing
accommodation and all other persons that occupy the housing
accommodation as their primary residence on other than a temporary
basis, excluding bona fide employees of such occupants residing therein
in connection with such employment and excluding bona fide subtenants in
occupancy pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred twenty-six-b
of the real property law. In the case where a housing accommodation is
sublet, the annual income of the tenant or co-tenant recited on the
lease who will reoccupy the housing accommodation upon the expiration of
the sublease shall be considered.
  2. Deregulation income threshold means total annual income equal to
one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the two preceding
calendar years for proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand
eleven. For proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand
eleven, the deregulation income threshold means the total annual income
equal to two hundred thousand dollars in each of the two preceding
calendar years.
  3. Deregulation rent threshold means two thousand dollars for
proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand eleven. For
proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand eleven, the
deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars.
  (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner
of each housing accommodation for which the legal regulated monthly rent
equals or exceeds the deregulation rent threshold may provide the tenant
or tenants residing therein with an income certification form prepared
by the division of housing and community renewal on which such tenant or
tenants shall identify all persons referred to in subdivision (a) of
this section and shall certify whether the total annual income is in
excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
calendar years. Such income certification form shall state that the
income level certified to by the tenant may be subject to verification
by the department of taxation and finance pursuant to section one
hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law, and shall not require disclosure
of any information other than whether the aforementioned threshold has
been exceeded. Such income certification form shall clearly state that:
(i) only tenants residing in housing accommodations which had a legal
regulated monthly rent that equals or exceeds the deregulation rent
threshold are required to complete the certification form; (ii) that
tenants have protections available to them which are designed to prevent
harassment; (iii) that tenants are not required to provide any
information regarding their income except that which is requested on the
form and may contain such other information the division deems
appropriate. The tenant or tenants shall return the completed
certification to the owner within thirty days after service upon the
tenant or tenants. In the event that the total annual income as
certified is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of
the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file the certification
with the state division of housing and community renewal on or before
June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing such certification with the
division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue
an order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject
to the provisions of this act upon the expiration of the existing lease.
A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof
shall be mailed to the owner.
  (c) 1. In the event that the tenant or tenants either fail to return
the completed certification to the owner on or before the date required
by subdivision (b) of this section or the owner disputes the
certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner may, on or
before June thirtieth of such year, petition the state division of
housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred
seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total annual income exceeds
the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
years. Within twenty days after the filing of such request with the
division, the division shall notify the tenant or tenants that such
tenant or tenants named on the lease must provide the division with such
information as the division and the department of taxation and finance
shall require to verify whether the total annual income exceeds the
deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
years. The division's notification shall require the tenant or tenants
to provide the information to the division within sixty days of service
upon such tenant or tenants and shall include a warning in bold faced
type that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the
division providing that such housing accommodations shall not be subject
to the provisions of this act.
  2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total
annual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each
of the two preceding calendar years, the division shall, on or before
November fifteenth of such year, notify the owner and tenants of the
results of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall have
thirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within
forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division
shall, where appropriate, issue an order providing that such housing
accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this act upon
expiration of the existing lease. A copy of such order shall be mailed
by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant
or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.
  3. In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information
required pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, the division
shall issue, on or before December first of such year, an order
providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the
provisions of this act upon the expiration of the current lease. A copy
of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be
sent to the owner.
  4. The provisions of the state freedom of information act shall not
apply to any income information obtained by the division pursuant to
this section.
  (d) This section shall apply only to paragraph twelve of subdivision a
of section five of this act.
  (e) Upon receipt of such order of deregulation pursuant to this
section, an owner shall offer the housing accommodation subject to such
order to the tenant at a rent not in excess of the market rent, which
for the purposes of this section means a rent obtainable in an arm's
length transaction. Such rental offer shall be made by the owner in
writing to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the
tenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within ten days of
receipt.  The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such
offer. If the tenant declines the offer or fails to respond within such
period, the owner may commence an action or proceeding for the eviction
of such tenant.
