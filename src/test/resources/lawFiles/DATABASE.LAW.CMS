            PERMANENT JOINT RULES OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
                              JOINT RULE I
  Section  1.  Requirement  of  Fiscal Impact Notes. Fiscal impact notes
shall be required  for  all  bills  and  amendments,  other  than  those
excepted  as  provided in section four hereof, which would substantially
affect the revenues or expenses, or both, of  any  county,  city,  town,
village, school district or special district (hereinafter referred to as
"political  subdivisions").  For purposes of this Joint Rule and section
51 of the Legislative Law, the term  "special  district"  shall  mean  a
district  possessing  the  power  to  contract  indebtedness and levy or
require the levy of taxes or benefit assessments upon real property.
  õ 2. Sufficiency and Contents of Fiscal Impact  Notes.  Fiscal  impact
notes  shall  be  deemed  sufficient  for purposes of this Joint Rule if
prepared in conformity with this section.
  A.  Scope  of  fiscal  estimates.   Fiscal   impact   upon   political
subdivisions  shall  be estimated on the basis of any one or more of the
following:
  (i) Individual political subdivisions; or
  (ii) Aggregates of political subdivisions (a) statewide or  by  lesser
geographic  area,  or  (b)  by  classification  or  subclassification of
relevant characteristics; or
  (iii)   Representative   political    subdivisions    with    relevant
characteristics  thereof  quantitatively  set  forth,  e.g., population,
area, weighted average daily attendance of pupils; or
  (iv) Any other  appropriate,  convenient  or  accessible  grouping  of
political subdivisions.
  B.  Units  of measurement. Fiscal impact measurements shall be made in
units of money, personal services, equipment, or any other  appropriate,
convenient or accessible units of measurement.
  C.  Negligible  Impact. A fiscal impact note filed by the sponsor of a
bill which states that the fiscal impact of the bill is negligible shall
be deemed to be in compliance with this Joint Rule.
  õ 3. Procedure. A. (i) The Temporary President of the Senate  and  the
Speaker  of the Assembly shall each designate a person in such officer's
respective house to examine each bill in such house, without  regard  to
its  house  of  origin, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a fiscal
impact note is required pursuant to this Joint Rule, and if such note is
required, such person shall so notify the sponsor of such bill.
  (ii) The sponsor of such bill shall provide such fiscal impact note on
a separate form prescribed therefor by the Temporary  President  of  the
Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly jointly.
  (iii)  Such  fiscal  impact note shall state the source thereof, which
may be the sponsor; provided, however,  that  in  the  case  of  a  bill
proposed  by  a  state department or agency, such note shall be prepared
and furnished by such department or agency.
  (iv)  Such designated person in each house shall thereupon review each
fiscal impact note for compliance with  the  provisions  of  this  Joint
Rule.
  B.  No  bill  requiring  a fiscal impact note shall be reported to the
floor of the house unless accompanied by the appropriate  note  for  the
version  of  such  bill  so reported, except as provided in section four
hereof.
  C. If an amendment to a bill has a fiscal impact, the member  offering
such  amendment  shall  provide  the fiscal impact note required by such
amendment. If such amendment  prevails,  the  sponsor  shall  provide  a
fiscal  impact  note  for  the amended bill before final passage, unless
excepted pursuant to subdivision F of section four hereof.
  õ 4. Exceptions. A fiscal impact note shall  not  be  required  for  a
bill:
  A. subject to the provisions of section 50 of the Legislative Law;
  B. requested by a county, city, town or village in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section two of Article
IX of the Constitution;
  C. which provides discretionary authority to a political subdivision;
  D. submitted pursuant to section 24 of the State Finance Law;
  E.  reported to the floor of the House by the Rules Committee, if such
committee, in its discretion, determines that  such  action  is  in  the
public interest;
  F. which has been amended on the floor of either house, where a fiscal
impact  note would otherwise have been required for such amended bill by
this Joint Rule and section 51 of the Legislative Law, if the  Temporary
President of the Senate or the Speaker of the Assembly, respectively, in
such officer's discretion, determines that the amended bill may be acted
on in such officer's house without such note; or
  G.  which  inadvertently  passes the Legislature where a fiscal impact
note would otherwise have been required by this Joint Rule  and  section
51 of the Legislative Law.
  õ 5. Effect of Inaccuracy. If the estimate or estimates contained in a
fiscal  impact  note  are  inaccurate, such inaccuracy shall not affect,
impair or invalidate such bill.
  õ 6. Application. The provisions of this Joint  Rule  shall  apply  to
bills  and  amendments proposed for introduction at the nineteen hundred
eighty-five regular legislative session and permanently thereafter.
                              JOINT RULE II
  Section  1.  Committee  on  Conference. The Temporary President of the
Senate and the Speaker of the  Assembly  may  jointly  convene  a  Joint
Committee  on  Conference  to  consider  and  report  upon substantially
similar but not identical legislation that has passed each House of  the
Legislature.  Such  committee  shall  be  constituted by the filing of a
joint certificate by the Temporary  President  of  the  Senate  and  the
Speaker  of  the Assembly with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk
of the Assembly, and shall consist of the same number  of  members  from
each House. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate, there shall be
five  members  on  such committee from each House to be appointed by the
Temporary President of the Senate who shall appoint the members from the
Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly who  shall  appoint  the  members
from the Assembly; provided, however, that of each House's delegation at
least  one  member  shall  represent  the  minority  in  each House. The
Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly  shall
each  appoint a co-chairperson of the committee and such co-chairpersons
shall convene and recess meetings of  the  committee.  Meetings  jointly
convened  by  the  co-chairpersons shall be subject to the provisions of
Article 7 of the Public Officers Law. The committee shall file a written
report setting forth the joint recommendations of  a  majority  of  each
House's delegation with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the
Assembly or such other committees or officers as may be set forth in the
certificate  and  such  report  may  include specific bill language that
would implement the joint committee's recommendations. No  report  shall
be  filed  except upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members
of each House's delegation on the committee.
