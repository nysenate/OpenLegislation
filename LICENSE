Open-Source Software & Software Licenses

In order to make the Senate's information and software as public as possible, it
is has adopted unique system using two types of licenses  - GNU General Public
License as well as the BSD License. This system is meant to ensure the most
public license is used in each specific case such that:

(i) Any Software released containing components with preexisting GPL copyrights
must be released pursuant to a GPL v3 copyright restriction.

(ii) Any Software created independently by the Senate without any preexisting
licensing restrictions on any of its components shall be released under dual
licensing and take one of two forms: (a) a BSD license, or (b) a GPL v3 license.
The ultimate user of such Software shall choose which form of licensing makes
the most sense for their project.

(iii) Regarding Software containing preexisting copyright restrictions other
than GPL, the CIO shall make the determination how they wish to release
such Software.
